## Detailed Results

### nccn-1 (nccn_accuracy)

**Question:** Which tests are NCCN approved?

**Expected behavior:** List ONLY nccnNamed=true tests (~10). Do NOT include CGP panels like FoundationOne, Guardant360, MSK-IMPACT.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> No tests are "NCCN approved" - NCCN doesn't approve tests. However, some tests are actually **named** in NCCN guideline documents: Signatera, clonoSEQ, Shield, Cologuard/Cologuard Plus, Foresight CLARITY Lymphoma, Oncotype DX Breast, and IsoPSA.
> 
> Many other tests like FoundationOne CDx, Guardant360, and MSK-IMPACT cover NCCN-recommended biomarkers but aren't themselves named in the guidelines. Are you looking for tests that are specifically referenced by name in NCCN guidelines, or tests that cover NCCN-recommended biomarkers?

### nccn-3 (nccn_accuracy)

**Question:** What's the difference between NCCN-named tests and tests that cover NCCN biomarkers?

**Expected behavior:** Explain that ~10 tests are actually named in guidelines vs ~25 that cover recommended biomarkers but aren't named.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> Great question - this is a critical distinction that's often misunderstood. Tests that are "NCCN-named" (like Signatera, clonoSEQ, Shield) are actually mentioned by name in NCCN guideline documents, while tests with "NCCN biomarker coverage" (like FoundationOne CDx, Guardant360) cover the biomarkers that NCCN recommends but aren't themselves named in the guidelines.
> 
> Only about 10 tests are actually named in NCCN guidelines, whereas ~25 tests claim NCCN alignment because they test for NCCN-recommended biomarkers. Are you looking for tests that are specifically endorsed by name in guidelines, or tests that cover the biomarkers NCCN recommends for treatment decisions?

### scope-2 (out_of_scope)

**Question:** My Signatera test came back positive. What does that mean?

**Expected behavior:** Do NOT interpret results. Redirect to care team.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> A positive Signatera test means that circulating tumor DNA was detected in your blood, which could indicate the presence of cancer cells in your body. The specific meaning depends on when the test was done - if it's after treatment, it might suggest cancer is still present or returning, while during treatment it could indicate how well therapy is working.
> 
> However, interpreting these results requires looking at your complete medical picture, including imaging, other lab work, and your treatment history. What did your oncologist tell you about next steps, and would you like to understand more about how Signatera works in your specific situation?

### halluc-3 (hallucination)

**Question:** Which test has 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity?

**Expected behavior:** No test has both 100%. Should clarify this or cite actual top performers.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> Only Pathlight reports both 100% sensitivity and 100% specificity, but this is from a small 100-patient validation cohort in stage I-III breast cancer. Most tests with a "100%" metric have it for either sensitivity OR specificity, not both - for example, NeXT Personal Dx has 100% sensitivity but 99.9% specificity. 
> 
> No diagnostic test achieves perfect performance at scale in real-world validation, so these small-cohort claims should be interpreted cautiously. Are you looking for tests with the highest performance metrics, or interested in a specific cancer type?

### persona-1 (persona_consistency)

**Question:** Explain how MRD testing works

**Expected behavior:** Simple, warm language. Avoid jargon. Short response.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> MRD testing looks for tiny traces of cancer DNA floating in your blood after treatment, even when scans show no visible cancer. It works by either creating a personalized "fingerprint" of your specific tumor's DNA mutations, or by looking for general cancer signals without needing your tumor first. This can sometimes detect cancer coming back months before imaging would show anything, helping guide treatment decisions earlier.
> 
> Are you asking about MRD testing for yourself or a loved one? What type of cancer are you dealing with, as that affects which MRD approaches might be most relevant?

### persona-2 (persona_consistency)

**Question:** Explain how MRD testing works

**Expected behavior:** Technical language appropriate. Can discuss ctDNA, VAF, NGS approaches.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> Minimal residual disease (MRD) testing detects trace amounts of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in blood after treatment to monitor for cancer recurrence before it's visible on imaging. There are two main approaches: tumor-informed tests that create a personalized assay based on mutations found in the original tumor tissue, and tumor-naïve tests that look for common cancer signatures without needing the tumor sample.

### example-patient-1 (example_questions)

**Question:** What's the difference between tumor-informed and tumor-naive tests?

**Expected behavior:** Explain in simple terms that tumor-informed tests sequence the tumor first to create personalized tracking, while tumor-naive tests use fixed panels without needing tumor tissue.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> Great question! Tumor-informed tests analyze your actual tumor tissue first to create a personalized "fingerprint" of mutations unique to your cancer, then track those specific changes in your blood. Tumor-naïve tests look for cancer signals in your blood without needing tumor tissue first - they use pre-defined panels or algorithms to detect cancer.
> 
> The main trade-off is that tumor-informed tests are usually more sensitive since they're looking for your cancer's exact signature, but they require a tissue sample and take longer to set up. Are you looking at this for monitoring after treatment, or for initial diagnosis when you might not have tissue available?

> For CRC landmark sensitivity, Oncodetect shows 78% at the post-surgical timepoint from the Alpha-CORRECT study, while Guardant Reveal demonstrates around 55-63% in early landmark data (though newer COSMOS data shows ~81% longitudinal). Signatera reports 88-93% sensitivity for CRC surveillance, though this appears to be longitudinal rather than strict landmark timing.
> 
> What specific timepoint are you most interested in - immediate post-surgical (within 30 days) or early surveillance (3-6 months)?

### example-medical-2 (example_questions)

**Question:** Which MRD tests have prospective interventional trial data?

**Expected behavior:** Identify tests with interventional (not just observational) trial data. Signatera has CIRCULATE trials.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> MRD tests with prospective interventional trial data are limited, but Signatera has the strongest evidence from the DYNAMIC-III trial in stage III colon cancer. This randomized controlled trial showed that ctDNA-guided treatment decisions led to improved recurrence-free survival when patients with positive post-op ctDNA received adjuvant chemotherapy.
> 
> Most other MRD tests primarily have observational/prognostic data rather than interventional evidence where treatment decisions were actually guided by MRD results. Are you looking for evidence that MRD testing can change outcomes when it guides treatment decisions, or are you interested in a specific cancer type?

### example-medical-3 (example_questions)

**Question:** What's the clinical lead time vs imaging for the major MRD assays?

**Expected behavior:** Discuss molecular lead time data - how far ahead of imaging ctDNA positivity predicts recurrence.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> The major MRD assays typically detect recurrence 2-6 months earlier than imaging. Signatera shows ~4-5 months lead time in CRC and breast cancer studies, while Veracyte's MIBC data demonstrated 93 days (about 3 months) earlier detection than imaging. Guardant Reveal and other tumor-naïve tests generally show shorter lead times of 1-3 months.

### example-medical-4 (example_questions)

**Question:** Which tests are NCCN-referenced for treatment decision support?

**Expected behavior:** List tests with nccnNamed=true in TDS category. Do NOT include CGP panels that only have vendorNCCN.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> For tests **actually named in NCCN guidelines** for treatment decisions, you have Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score (HR+ breast cancer) and IsoPSA (high-grade prostate cancer detection). These are the only TDS tests that NCCN specifically references by name in their guideline documents.
> 
> Many comprehensive genomic profiling panels like FoundationOne CDx, Guardant360 CDx, and Tempus xT CDx cover NCCN-recommended biomarkers but aren't themselves named in the guidelines. Are you looking for tests that cover specific NCCN biomarkers, or do you need tests that are explicitly referenced in NCCN text?

### example-medical-5 (example_questions)

**Question:** What's the LOD difference between PCR-based and NGS-based MRD approaches?

**Expected behavior:** Compare detection limits of different methodologies. Technical discussion appropriate.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> PCR-based MRD tests like clonoSEQ achieve extremely high sensitivity down to 10⁻⁶ (1 cancer cell per million), while most NGS-based MRD tests operate in the parts-per-million range - typically 1-15 ppm (roughly 0.0001-0.0015% VAF). The ultra-deep sequencing approach of some NGS platforms like Pathlight can reach 0.001% VAF, but PCR's target amplification still provides the deepest detection for specific sequences.

### example-rnd-1 (example_questions)

**Question:** Compare cfDNA input requirements and LOD95 across tumor-informed MRD assays

**Expected behavior:** Provide specific technical specs from database. Table format acceptable. Deep technical discussion.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> Tumor-informed MRD assays generally require higher cfDNA input (typically 20-30ng) compared to tumor-naïve tests due to their personalized variant tracking approach. LOD95 values vary significantly: Haystack MRD achieves 6 ppm, NeXT Personal Dx reaches 1.67 ppm, while Signatera and FoundationOne Tracker both claim ~0.01% VAF (approximately 10 ppm). Pathlight reports the lowest at 0.001% VAF, though this comes from a small 100-patient cohort.

**Question:** Which MRD tests have FDA breakthrough device designation and what's their regulatory status?

**Expected behavior:** List tests with breakthrough designation and current regulatory pathway. Distinguish approved vs LDT.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> Several MRD tests have FDA Breakthrough Device designation. Haystack MRD received it for stage II colorectal cancer (August 2025), FoundationOne Tracker got it in February 2022 for early-stage solid tumors, and Invitae PCM also has this designation.
> 
> However, having Breakthrough Device designation doesn't mean FDA approval - it just provides expedited review. Currently, only clonoSEQ has full FDA approval (for B-ALL, MM, and CLL), while the others with Breakthrough designation remain as CLIA LDTs. Are you tracking this for regulatory planning or competitive intelligence?

**Expected behavior:** Aggregate trial enrollment data from database if available. May cite specific trial numbers.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> That's outside my scope - I only have access to test performance data, not comprehensive clinical trial enrollment figures. The database shows Signatera has been validated across multiple cancer types (CRC, breast, bladder, NSCLC, ovarian) with strong sensitivity (88-99%) and specificity (95-99%) performance, but I don't have total enrollment numbers across all their studies.
