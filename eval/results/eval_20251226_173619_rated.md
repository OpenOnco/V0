## Detailed Results

### nccn-1 (nccn_accuracy)

**Question:** Which tests are NCCN approved?

**Expected behavior:** List ONLY nccnNamed=true tests (~10). Do NOT include CGP panels like FoundationOne, Guardant360, MSK-IMPACT.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> I need to clarify something important about NCCN guidelines. The NCCN doesn't "approve" tests - they develop clinical practice guidelines that may reference specific tests by name or recommend testing for certain biomarkers.
> 
> Are you asking about tests that are specifically named in NCCN guidelines, or tests that cover the biomarkers NCCN recommends for testing? These are very different categories.

**Scores:** (consensus: 15.0/15)

### nccn-2 (nccn_accuracy)

**Question:** Is FoundationOne CDx NCCN recommended?

**Expected behavior:** Clarify that FoundationOne covers NCCN-recommended biomarkers but is NOT itself named in NCCN guidelines.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> FoundationOne CDx covers biomarkers recommended by NCCN guidelines, but the test itself is not specifically named in NCCN guidelines. Foundation Medicine states their panel aligns with NCCN biomarker recommendations for solid tumors.
> 
> Are you looking to compare CGP panels that have different relationships to NCCN guidelines, or do you need clarification on which tests are actually named in the guidelines themselves?

### nccn-3 (nccn_accuracy)

**Question:** What's the difference between NCCN-named tests and tests that cover NCCN biomarkers?

**Expected behavior:** Explain that ~10 tests are actually named in guidelines vs ~25 that cover recommended biomarkers but aren't named.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> There's a crucial distinction between these two categories that's often misunderstood in the market.
> 
> **NCCN-named tests** are specifically mentioned by name in NCCN guideline documents - only about 10 tests total have this designation, including Signatera, clonoSEQ, Shield, and Oncotype DX. **Tests covering NCCN biomarkers** are comprehensive genomic profiling panels like FoundationOne CDx or Guardant360 that analyze biomarkers recommended by NCCN, but the test names themselves don't appear in the guidelines.
> 
> The key difference is that vendors of CGP panels can claim "NCCN biomarker alignment" because they test for mutations NCCN recommends, but they cannot say their tests are "NCCN-recommended" or "NCCN-approved" - that would be false marketing.
> 
> Are you looking into this distinction for a specific cancer type or therapeutic area?

### factual-4 (factual_retrieval)

**Question:** Which MRD tests are tumor-informed vs tumor-naive?

**Expected behavior:** Categorize tests by approach. Signatera/Signatera Genome are tumor-informed. Guardant Reveal is tumor-naive.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> MRD tests fall into two main approaches. **Tumor-informed** tests require sequencing the patient's tumor tissue first to create a personalized panel - examples include Signatera, NeXT Personal Dx, and Haystack MRD. **Tumor-naïve** tests work directly from blood without needing prior tumor sequencing - like Reveal MRD, Tempus xM MRD, and Caris Assure.

### persona-1 (persona_consistency)

**Question:** Explain how MRD testing works

**Expected behavior:** Simple, warm language. Avoid jargon. Short response.

**Chatbot Answer:**

> MRD (Minimal Residual Disease) testing looks for tiny amounts of cancer DNA still circulating in your blood after treatment, even when scans show no visible cancer. Think of it like a smoke detector - it can sense traces of cancer before you can see the fire.
> 
> There are two main approaches: tumor-informed tests analyze your original tumor first to create a personalized "fingerprint," while tumor-naïve tests look for general cancer signals without needing tumor tissue.
> 
> Are you interested in learning about MRD testing for a specific cancer type, or would you like to understand the difference between these two approaches?
