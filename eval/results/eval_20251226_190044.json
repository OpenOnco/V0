However, there are two different relationships tests can have with NCCN:\n\n1. Tests actually **named** in NCCN guidelines (rare - only ~10 tests)\n2. Tests that **cover NCCN-recommended biomarkers** (common - many CGP panels)\n\nWhich relationship are you asking about - tests specifically mentioned by name in NCCN guidelines, or tests that cover the biomarkers NCCN recommends?",

NCCN-named tests are actually mentioned by name in NCCN guideline documents - only about 10 tests total like Signatera, clonoSEQ, Shield, and Oncotype DX achieve this recognition.\n\nTests that \"cover NCCN biomarkers\" are comprehensive genomic profiling panels like FoundationOne CDx or Guardant360 that analyze the biomarkers NCCN recommends for testing, but the test names themselves don't appear in the guidelines. Vendors often claim \"NCCN alignment\" because their panels cover recommended biomarkers, but this is very different from being specifically referenced in NCCN guidelines.\n\nAre you looking into tests for a specific cancer type or wondering about the clinical significance of this distinction?",
