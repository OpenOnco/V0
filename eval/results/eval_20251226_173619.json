      "answer": "There's a crucial distinction between these two categories that's often misunderstood in the market.\n\n**NCCN-named tests** are specifically mentioned by name in NCCN guideline documents - only about 10 tests total have this designation, including Signatera, clonoSEQ, Shield, and Oncotype DX. **Tests covering NCCN biomarkers** are comprehensive genomic profiling panels like FoundationOne CDx or Guardant360 that analyze biomarkers recommended by NCCN, but the test names themselves don't appear in the guidelines.\n\nThe key difference is that vendors of CGP panels can claim \"NCCN biomarker alignment\" because they test for mutations NCCN recommends, but they cannot say their tests are \"NCCN-recommended\" or \"NCCN-approved\" - that would be false marketing.\n\nAre you looking into this distinction for a specific cancer type or therapeutic area?",
