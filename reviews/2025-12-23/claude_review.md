## ✅ VERIFIED ACCURATE (spot-checked and confirmed)

Based on my searches, the following tests appear to have accurate current information in the database:

1. **Signatera** - Correctly listed as CLIA LDT (not FDA cleared). Medicare coverage for multiple indications is accurate. Four BDDs confirmed.

2. **clonoSEQ** - 
"clonoSEQ is the first and only FDA-cleared in vitro diagnostic (IVD) test service to detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in bone marrow from patients with multiple myeloma (MM) or B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (B-ALL) and blood or bone marrow from patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL)."
 FDA-cleared status and indications confirmed.

3. **FoundationOne Liquid CDx** - FDA-approved status confirmed with multiple CDx indications.

4. **Guardant Reveal** - MRD test appropriately listed as CLIA LDT.

5. **Foresight CLARITY** - Natera acquisition (Dec 2025) reflected. NCCN guideline inclusion for DLBCL confirmed.

## Additional Notes

### Regulatory Updates to Monitor:

1. **Galleri PMA Timeline**: 
"GRAIL expects to complete the PMA modular submission for Galleri, which is under a Breakthrough Device Designation, in the first half of 2026."


2. **Signatera FDA Pathway**: 
"Following modules for the MIBC indication will include software, as well as analytical and clinical validation data. Natera expects to submit these through 2025, pending completion of an ongoing registrational trial."


3. **Veracyte MRD (C2i)**: 
"Veracyte's first application of C2i Genomics' technology will be a muscle-invasive bladder cancer MRD test, which... Veracyte aims to launch in the first half of 2026."


### Competitive Landscape Changes:

1. **MCED Market**: With Cancerguard launching September 2025 at $689, there's now direct competition to Galleri (~$949). Guardant Shield is FDA-approved for CRC-specific screening.

2. **MRD Market**: The market is increasingly competitive with Labcorp Plasma Detect entering clinical use alongside established players. Signatera's IMvigor011 results strengthen its bladder cancer position.

3. **CDx Expansions**: Both Guardant360 CDx and FoundationOne Liquid CDx continue adding CDx indications, particularly in breast cancer (ESR1 mutations) and NSCLC.
