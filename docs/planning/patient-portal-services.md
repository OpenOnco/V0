# Patient Portal Services - Strategic Planning

*Generated: January 24, 2026*

## Core Value Proposition

**What we get from patients:** Real TAT data, actual out-of-pocket costs, coverage outcomes (approved/denied/appealed)

**What we give patients:** Clarity, control, and companionship in navigating the testing landscape

---

## High-Value Services to Offer

### 1. "My Testing Journey" Dashboard
- Track tests they've had, pending results, upcoming recommended tests
- Timeline visualization of their diagnostic/monitoring path
- Reminders for surveillance testing (huge for MRD - "it's been 3 months since your last Signatera")

### 2. Personalized Test Alerts
- "New test approved for [your cancer type]"
- "Coverage policy changed - [test] now covered by [payer]"
- "Clinical trial opened that requires [biomarker] testing you already have"

### 3. Pre-Test Cost & Coverage Intelligence
- "Before you order this test" checklist
- Prior authorization guidance specific to their insurance
- Financial assistance program finder (many vendors have them, patients don't know)
- Appeal letter templates when coverage is denied

### 4. Questions for Your Oncologist
This one is underrated. Patients often leave appointments not knowing what they should have asked:
- Stage-appropriate question lists
- "Based on your profile, here are tests to discuss"
- Printable one-pagers to bring to appointments

### 5. Results Decoder
- Plain-language explanations of what test results mean
- "What happens next" guidance based on results
- Red flags that warrant calling your care team

### 6. The Waiting Room (Community Element)
- Anonymized stories: "I had this test, here's what the experience was like"
- Not a forum (moderation nightmare) but curated patient perspectives
- Partner with cancer-specific advocacy orgs who already have communities

## What Makes This Different

The insight that most oncologists understand MRD but don't use it due to lack of actionable guidelines applies to patients too—but inverted. **Patients don't understand MRD, but desperately want actionable guidance.**

You're not competing with WebMD (generic info) or cancer center portals (institution-specific). You're the only place offering:
- Test-specific, vendor-neutral guidance
- Real coverage reality, not vendor marketing
- Ongoing relationship through their entire journey

## Minimum Viable Portal (MVP)

If launching tomorrow, start with:
1. **Profile creation** (cancer type, stage, treatment phase, insurance)
2. **Personalized test recommendations** (pulled from existing database)
3. **Coverage reality check** for their insurance
4. **"Ask about these tests" printable** for their next appointment
5. **Opt-in to alerts** for new tests/coverage changes

Then add the data collection: "Help other patients by sharing your experience" - cost, TAT, coverage outcome.

## The Emotional Layer

One thing that would have helped Ingrid: **feeling less alone in the uncertainty**. Consider a "What I Wish I'd Known" section—curated wisdom from patients further along. Not medical advice, but emotional preparation:
- "The waiting for results is harder than the results themselves"
- "Write your questions down before appointments—chemo brain is real"
- "It's okay to get a second opinion on which tests to order"

## Data Collection Opportunity

### What Patients Can Contribute
- Actual out-of-pocket cost paid
- Real turnaround time experienced
- Coverage outcome (approved/denied/appealed)
- Appeal success rate and strategies

### Privacy Considerations
- All data anonymized and aggregated
