# OpenOnco: Bridging the Gap Between Diagnostic Innovation and Care Delivery

## Grant Proposal for Pharma & Foundation Partners
*January 2026*

---

## The Opportunity

Cancer diagnostic testing has transformed from episodic events into a continuous conversation with disease—spanning inherited risk, early detection, treatment selection, response monitoring, and survivorship surveillance. The liquid biopsy industry has achieved remarkable innovation, bringing transformative tests to patients faster than ever before.

**Yet a fundamental gap persists**: Healthcare delivery infrastructure has not kept pace with diagnostic innovation.

Test developers excel at creating sophisticated assays. But they are laboratories, not care delivery organizations. Meanwhile, the clinical systems that should provide integration—oncology practices, health systems, guidelines bodies—move slowly and struggle to keep pace.

**The result**: Patients receive cutting-edge test results without support infrastructure to act on them. Community oncologists face tests not yet in guidelines without decision support. Care transitions become failure points where context is lost.

**OpenOnco exists to bridge this gap**—vendor-neutral, patient-centered, helping patients and oncologists understand which tests exist, what results mean, and what comes next.

## What We've Built (With Zero Funding)

### The Most Comprehensive Liquid Biopsy Database in the World

| Category | Tests Catalogued | Description |
|----------|------------------|-------------|
| **MRD** (Molecular Residual Disease) | 41 | Post-treatment surveillance for recurrence |
| **ECD** (Early Cancer Detection) | 27 | Screening including MCED tests |
| **HCT** (Hereditary Cancer Testing) | 33 | Inherited risk assessment |
| **TDS** (Treatment Decision Support) | 41 | Comprehensive genomic profiling |
| **Total** | **142 tests** | Across the full testing continuum |

### Vendor Coverage

**68 diagnostic companies** catalogued, from industry leaders to emerging innovators:
- Major labs: Foundation Medicine, Guardant Health, Tempus, Natera, Exact Sciences
- Specialty players: Adaptive Biotechnologies, GRAIL, Caris Life Sciences
- Emerging innovators: DELFI Diagnostics, Freenome, Personalis
- International players: Burning Rock, Geneseeq, IMBdx

### Regulatory Intelligence

For each test, we track:
- FDA approval/clearance status (PMA, 510(k), De Novo, Breakthrough Device)
- CLIA/CAP laboratory certifications
- CE-IVDR status for international context
- Medicare coverage policies (NCD/LCD linkage)

### Coverage Reality Check (In Development)

Our signature feature: Cross-referencing vendor marketing claims against actual payer policies
- Medicare LCD policy integration
- Private payer medical policy tracking
- Prior authorization guidance
- Appeal letter templates

## The Vision: Testing as the Unifying Thread

One thing connects every stage of the cancer journey: **molecular testing**. Tests are ordered at every phase. Results are objective and portable. Data should carry context across care transitions.

Testing can become the unifying thread through fragmented cancer care—**if an integration layer exists to make it so.**

### The Testing Continuum

1. **Hereditary Cancer Testing** → "Am I at risk?"
2. **Early Cancer Detection** → "Do I have cancer?"
3. **Treatment Decision Support** → "What treatment will work?"
4. **Response Monitoring** → "Is treatment working?"
5. **Recurrence Monitoring** → "Is it coming back?"

Each stage hands off to the next. Throughout this continuum, OpenOnco provides the integration layer—helping patients and oncologists understand which tests exist, what's covered, what results mean, and what comes next.

## Why Pharma Should Care

### For Diagnostic Developers

**Problem**: You've built an excellent test. Patients don't understand it. Oncologists don't know when to order it. Coverage is inconsistent.

**OpenOnco's Value**:
- Vendor-neutral platform increases category awareness
- Accurate coverage information reduces ordering friction
- Patient education reduces support burden
- Category-level advocacy benefits all players

### For Pharmaceutical Companies

**Problem**: Your therapies depend on companion diagnostics. Patients eligible for your drugs aren't getting tested. Coverage gaps delay treatment initiation.

**OpenOnco's Value**:
- Increase appropriate testing for your biomarker
- Educate patients about testing options that lead to your therapy
- Navigate coverage to accelerate treatment access
- Track real-world testing patterns and coverage outcomes

### For All Stakeholders

**The structural gap between diagnostic innovation and care delivery hurts everyone.**

Patients don't get tested appropriately. Tests don't reach patients who need them. Therapies don't reach patients who would benefit. Coverage remains a barrier rather than an enabler.

**OpenOnco is the integration layer the ecosystem needs.**
