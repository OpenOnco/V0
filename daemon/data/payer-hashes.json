NCCN testing criteria for individual syndromes are included in NCCN Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Colorectal, Endometrial, and Gastric (access to NCCN Guidelines is free with registration). The criteria are found in the following sections:\n\nLynch Syndrome- HRS-3\nAdenomatous Polyposis-POLYP-1\nJuvenile Polyposis Syndrome- JPS-1\nPeutz-Jeughers Syndrome- PJS1\nHereditary Diffuse Cancer syndrome- HGAST1\nSerrated Polyposis Syndrome (SPS1)\nLi-Fraumeni Syndrome and Cowden Syndrome testing criteria are found in the NCCN Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic Guidelines.\n\nNote: Genetic testing is considered medically necessary for the syndrome specific gene or genes noted in the NCCN guidelines. Multi-gene panel tests that include additional genes are considered medically necessary only for individuals with a personal or family history of a related cancer, more than one potential inherited cancer syndrome could be responsible for the clinical presentation, and the panel is more efficient than multiple single gene or targeted panel tests. All other uses of multi-gene panel tests, panel tests that include RNA analysis, or polygenic risk scores are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven. Genetic testing including multi-gene panel testing for inherited cancers is considered a once in a lifetime benefit. \n\nSee also CPB 0516 - Colorectal Cancer Screening.\n\nPrenatal and Preconception Carrier Screening\n\nAetna considers prenatal and preconception carrier screening medically necessary when the following criteria are met:\n\nExpanded (panel) carrier screening: unless previously performed, panel must include cystic fibrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and/or hemoglobinopathies for individuals/couples who are pregnant or planning a pregnancy; and\nResults of the test will be used in management of the pregnancy, potentially affected fetus, or for family planning.\n\nNotes:\n\nConsistent with the 2021 American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) practice resource guideline, Aetna considers a pan-ethnic panel screening approach (greater than or equal to 15 genes [≥15 genes]) to be medically necessary once per lifetime for recessively inherited conditions with a carrier frequency of greater than or equal to 1 in 200 (≥1/200).\n\nAetna considers targeted carrier screening as medically necessary when limited to testing of a known familial mutation or for testing of a specific condition/gene based on family history. Aetna considers targeted carrier screening not medically necessary for all other indications. \n\nAetna considers genetic carrier testing experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nAetna considers repeat carrier screening experimental, investigational, or unproven.\n\nSpecific Genetic Tests:\n\nAndrogen insensitivity syndrome (AIS):\n\nAetna considers AR (androgen receptor) gene sequence analysis for AIS as medically necessary for the following indications below. (Testing strategy: Begin with sequence analysis of AR. If pathogenic variant in AR is not identified, gene-targeted deletion/duplication analysis may be considered),\n\nIndividual to be tested exhibits signs or symptoms of AIS (e.g., undermasculinization of the external genitalia, impaired spermatogenesis with otherwise normal testes, absent or rudimentary müllerian structures (i.e., fallopian tubes, uterus, and cervix) and results will directly impact clinical management; or\nCarrier screening of female reproductive partner planning a pregnancy and has family history of AIS consistent with X-linked inheritance (i.,e., affected 46,XY individuals, manifesting heterozygous females (46,XX)); or\nPrenatal testing in the offspring of the biological parent with confirmed AR mutation.\n\nAetna considers genetic testing for AIS experimental, investigational, or unproven for the identification of AR carriers in the general population and for all other indications because there is inadequate evidence in the published peer-reviewed clinical literature regarding its effectiveness.\n\nAngelman syndrome:\n\nAetna considers genetic testing medically necessary to confirm a diagnosis of AS when the following criteria are met:\n\nPresence of gait ataxia and/or tremulous movement of the limbs; and\nPresence of severe developmental delay or intellectual disability; and\nPresence of severe speech impairment; and\nPresence of unique behavior with inappropriate happy demeanor that includes frequent laughing, smiling and excitability.\n\nAS Testing Strategy:\n\nTesting begins with DNA methylation analysis chromosome 15 (15q11-q13)\nIf DNA methylation analysis is normal, then proceed to UBE3A sequence analysis\nIf DNA methylation analysis is abnormal, then proceed to deletion/duplication analysis/ FISH/CMA\nIf deletion/duplication analysis/FISH/CMA is normal, then proceed to uniparental disomy (UPD) study\nIf UPD is normal, then proceed to imprinting defect (ID) study.\nArrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C):\n\nComprehensive genetic testing (DSC2, DSG2, DSP, JUP, PKP2, and TMEM43) is considered medically necessary for members with confirmed or suspected diagnosis of arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia/cardiomyopathy (ARVD/C) (i.e., persons who have at least two minor criteria or one major Task Force criteria) (see Appendix). Mutation-specific genetic testing for ARVC is considered medically necessary for first or second-degree relatives of the index case following the identification of the ARVC-causative mutation in the index case. \n\nGenetic testing for ARVD/C is considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications.\n\nAshkenazi Jewish testing panel:\n\nAetna considers medically necessary preconception or prenatal carrier screening for persons of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry with a panel of genetic tests recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG):\n\nTay Sachs disease\nCanavan disease\nCystic fibrosis\nFamilial dysautonomia\nFamilial hyperinsulinism\nJoubert syndrome\nMaple syrup urine disease\nBloom syndrome\nFanconi anemia\nNiemann-Pick disease\nGaucher disease\nGlycogen storage disease type 1\nMucolipidosis IV\nNemaline myopathy.\n\nIf only one partner is of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry, then testing of that partner is considered medically necessary. Testing of the other partner is considered medically necessary only if the result of testing of the Ashkenazi Jewish partner is positive.\n\nAutosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD):\n\nGenetic testing for ADPKD (PKD1, PKD2) is considered medically necessary for adults with multiple cysts on appropriate imaging studies (ultrasound, CT or MRI) in persons who are at high risk for rapid progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as determined by their treating nephrologist who are being considered for tolvaptan (Jynarque).\n\nCADASIL:\n\nAetna considers DNA testing for CADASIL medically necessary for either of the following indications:\n\nPre-symptomatic individuals where there is a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and there is a known mutation in an affected member of the family; or\nSymptomatic individuals who have a family history consistent with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance of this condition (clinical signs and symptoms of CADASIL include stroke, cognitive defects and/or dementia, migraine, and psychiatric disturbances).\n\nAetna considers CADASIL genetic testing experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nCatecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT):\n\nAetna considers genetic testing for CPVT medically necessary for the following indications:\n\nMember has either of the following:\n\nA first-degree relative (i.e., parent, full-sibling, child) with a confirmed CPVT mutation (Note: Test for known familial mutation); or\nA structurally normal heart and presents with syncope or cardiac arrest due to VT or ventricular fibrillation (VF) precipitated by exercise-, catecholamine, or emotional stress; and\n\nTesting will be targeted to genes associated with CPVT (e.g., RYR2, CASQ2, TRDN, TECRL, CALM1, CALM2, CALM3). Note: A cardiac ion channelopathy genomic sequencing panel followed if negative by reflex duplication/deletion gene analysis panel is considered an equally acceptable alternative to serial single-gene testing for this indication.\n\nCorneal dystrophy:\n\nAetna considers genetic testing of the TGFBI (transforming growth factor, beta-induced) gene medically necessary for the following indications:\n\nMembers have been evaluated by an ophthalmologist and corneal dystrophy is suspected; and\nMember has a parent affected with corneal dystrophy or is a known carrier of a TGFBI mutation; and\nResults of genetic testing will either: \nconfirm diagnosis that may not be clear (e.g., granular corneal dystrophy type II (GCD2)) based on clinical findings (e.g., slit lamp exam) and results will directly impact clinical management; or\naffect member's reproductive decisions when individual is the reproductive partner of an individual affected with corneal dystrophy or is a known carrier of a TGFBI mutation.\n\nAetna considers genetic testing for corneal dystrophy experimental, investigational, or unproven for the identification of TGFBI carriers in the general population and for all other indications because there is inadequate evidence in the published peer-reviewed clinical literature regarding its effectiveness.\n\nCystic fibrosis:\n\nAetna considers genetic carrier testing for cystic fibrosis medically necessary for members in any of the following groups:\n\nPersons and their reproductive partners seeking prenatal care; or\nPersons and their reproductive partners who are planning a pregnancy; or\nPersons with a family history of cystic fibrosis; or\nPersons with a first degree relative identified as a cystic fibrosis carrier; or\nReproductive partners of persons with cystic fibrosis; or\nPositive newborn screen for CF, or signs and symptoms of CF are present, and sweat chloride test is positive, intermediate, inconclusive or cannot be performed (eg, infant is too young to produce adequate volumes of sweat).\n\nAetna considers a core panel of 25 mutations that are recommended by the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) medically necessary for cystic fibrosis genetic testing.  The standard CF transmembrane regulator (CFTR) mutation panel is as follows: (Available at: American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics\nopens a dialog\n):\n\nStandard CF Transmembrane Regulator (CFTR) Mutation  \nΔF508\tΔI507\tG542X\tG551D\tW1282X \tN1303K \nR553X\t621+1G→ T\tR117H\t1717-1G→ A\tA455E\tR560T\nR1162X\tG85E\tR334W\tR347P\t711+1G→ T\t1898+1G→ A\n2184delA\t1078delT\t3849+10kbC→ T\t2789+5G→ A\t3659delC\tI148T\n3120+1G→ A\t \t \t \t \t \n\nAetna considers full gene sequencing for cystic fibrosis (CF) medically necessary only in members presenting with a positive newborn screen, bronchiectasis, symptoms of CF, or a positive family history for CF and sweat chloride values in the intermediate range (between 30 and 59 mmol/L) on 2 separate occasions.\n\nAetna considers genetic carrier testing for cystic fibrosis experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nAetna considers screening for cystic fibrosis mutations that extend beyond the standard mutation panel recommended by the ACMG experimental, investigational, or unproven.\n\nDilated cardiomyopathy (DCM):\n\nAetna considers single- or multi-gene genetic testing medically necessary to confirm diagnosis of hereditary DCM diagnosis when either criteria is met:\n\nMember has confirmed DCM with no identifiable cause (e.g., autoimmune disease, drug-related, endocrine disorders, infections, toxins); and\n\nTesting will be targeted to genes related to DCM (e.g., BAG3, DSP, FLNC, LMNA, MYH7, RBM20, TNNT2, TTN); and\nMember meets any of the following:\nMember has cardiac conduction disease (first-, second-, or third-degree block); or\nSudden unexplained cardiac death in a first- or second-degree blood relative 40 years of age or younger; or\nTesting will inform prognosis, treatment selection, or reproductive management; or\n\nCascade genetic testing in member considered at-risk for DCM when all of the following criteria are met:\n\nFirst-degree relative has confirmed hereditary DCM established by genetic testing or had sudden unexplained cardiac death prior to age 40; and\nTesting will be targeted to genes related to DCM; and\nTesting will inform prognosis, treatment selection, or reproductive management.\nDuchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy:\n\nAetna considers DMD gene testing medically necessary when the following criteria are met:\n\nCarrier screening when the individual to be tested is an asymptomatic female and has an affected blood relative in whom a disease-causing DMD or BMD mutation has been identified. (Testing Strategy: Test for known mutation); or\nIndividual to be tested\nFootnote1\n* exhibits characteristic features of DMD or BMD (eg, progressive symmetric muscular weakness (proximal greater than distal) often with enlargement of calf muscles, wheelchair dependency before age 13 years for DMD and after age 16 years for BMD); and individual has elevated serum creatine kinase (CK) concentration. (Note: Normal value ranges may vary slightly among different labs. Some labs use different measurements or test different samples. In males with DMD, serum CK levels are >10 times normal and in BMD five times normal. Some female carriers of DMD or BMD have levels two to 10 times normal).\n\nFootnote1\n* Note on Testing Strategy: Testing begins with deletion/duplication analysis of DMD gene. Sequence analysis of DMD gene is considered medically necessary for individuals with a negative deletion/duplication result. \n\nEhlers-Danlos syndrome:\n\nAetna considers sequence analysis\nFootnote2\n** of COL3A1 gene for EDS vascular type when the following criteria are met:\n\nAsymptomatic individuals with a first-degree blood relative (ie, parent, full-sibling, child) who has been diagnosed with EDS vascular type in whom the disease-causing mutation has been identified; or\nSymptomatic individuals to confirm a diagnosis of EDS vascular type when the following criteria are met:\n\nPresence or history of at least one of the following:\n\nArterial rupture; or\nFirst-degree blood relative (ie, parent, full-sibling, child) diagnosed with EDS vascular type; or\nIntestinal rupture; or\nUterine rupture during pregnancy; or\n\nPresence or history of at least two of the following:\n\nAcrogeria (aged appearance to extremities, particularly hands); or\nArteriovenous carotid cavernous sinus fistula; or\nCharacteristic facial appearance (thin lips and philtrum, small chin, thin nose, large eyes); or\nChronic joint subluxations/dislocations; or\nClubfoot; or\nCongenital dislocation of the hips; or\nEarly-onset varicose veins; or\nEasy bruising (spontaneous or with minimal trauma); or\nGingival recession; or\nHypermobility of small joints; or\nPneumothorax/pneumohemothorax; or\nTendon/muscle rupture; or\nThin, translucent skin (especially noticeable on chest/abdomen). \n\nFootnote2\n**Note: Testing begins with sequence analysis of COL3A1 gene. Biochemical (protein-based) testing may be considered for individuals with a negative sequencing result or when a sequence variant of unknown significance (VUS) is found.\n\nGenetic testing for EDS is considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications, including the following:\n\nAn at-risk (unaffected) individual when an affected family member has been tested for mutations and received a result of VUS (also known as unclassified variant or variant of uncertain significance); or\nDeletion/duplication analysis of COL3A1 gene; or\nEDS, arthrochalasia (COL1A1, COL1A2 genes); or\nEDS, dermatosparaxis (ADAMTS2 gene); or\nEDS, hypermobility type (TNXB gene); or\nEDS, kyphoscoliotic type (PLOD1); or\nEDS, classic type (COL5A1 and COL5A2 genes); or\nGeneral population screening.\nFactor V Leiden:\n\nAetna considers Factor V Leiden genetic testing medically necessary for members with an abnormal activated protein C (APC) resistance assay result\nFootnote15\n§§§ and any of the following indications:\n\nAsymptomatic female who is planning pregnancy or is currently pregnant and not taking anticoagulation therapy and either of the following:\n\nFirst-degree blood relative (ie, parent, full-sibling, child) with a history of high-risk thrombophilia (eg, antithrombin deficiency, double heterozygosity or homozygosity for FVL or prothrombin G20210A); or\nFirst-degree blood relative (ie, parent, full-sibling, child) with venous thromboembolism (VTE) before age 50 years; or\nFirst unprovoked (eg, from an unknown cause) VTE at any age (especially age less than 50 years); or\nIndividual with a first VTE AND a first-degree blood family member (ie, parent, full-sibling, child) with a VTE occurring before age 50 years; or\nIndividual with history of recurrent VTE; or\nVenous thrombosis at unusual sites (eg, cerebral, mesenteric, portal and hepatic veins); or\nVTE associated with the use of oral contraceptives or hormone replacement therapy (HRT); or\nVTE during pregnancy or the puerperium; or\nFor Factor V Leiden genetic testing for recurrent pregnancy loss, see CPB 0348 - Recurrent Pregnany Loss. \n\nFootnote15\n§§§ The requirement to have an abnormal activated protein C (APC) resistance assay result is waived if the member is on direct oral anticoagulants (e.g., apixaban [Eliquis], dabigatran [Pradaxa], rivaroxaban [Xarelto], or edoxaban [Savaysa]).\n\nAetna considers Factor V Leiden genetic testing experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nFamilial hypercholesterolemia:\n\nBased upon a consensus statement on familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) from the European Atherosclerosis Society (Nordestgaard, et al., 2013), Aetna considers genetic testing for familial hypercholesterolemia medically necessary in persons who meet any of the following criteria:\n\nPersons with a definite or probable diagnosis of FH (DLCN > 5) \nFootnote3\n***; or\nFirst degree relative with a causative FH mutation\nFootnote3\n***; or\nPlasma total cholesterol ≥310 mg/dL (> 8 mmol/L) in an adult or adult family member(s)\nFootnote4\n† or >230 mg/dL (> 6 mmol/L) in a child or child family member(s)\nFootnote4\n†); or\nPremature clinical CHD\nFootnote5\n†† in the subject or family member(s)\nFootnote4\n†; or\nTendon xanthomas in the subject or family member(s)\nFootnote4\n†; or\nSudden premature cardiac death in a family member\nFootnote4\n†. \n\nNote: Genetic testing for FH includes LDL-R mutations (approximately 75% of FH mutations), Apo-B mutations (approximately 20%) and PCSK9 mutations (approximately 5%).\n\nFootnote3\n*** The European Atherosclerosis Society recommends using the DLCN criteria (available at European Heart Journal\nopens a dialog\n) to establish the clinical diagnosis of FH. Among individuals with a definite or probable diagnosis of FH (DLCN > 5), and particularly those with an obvious clinical diagnosis with xanthoma and/or high cholesterol plus a family history of premature CHD, molecular genetic testing is strongly recommended. When a causative mutation is found in the index case, a genetic test should be offered to all first-degree relatives\n\nFootnote4\n† In cases of probable or definite FH, cascade screening using LDL cholesterol measurement in the family should be conducted and the subject referred for genetic testing if available, with subsequent cascade testing in the family if a causative mutation is found. Initial family members to be tested are biological first-degree relatives, namely parents, siblings, and children. Biological second-degree relatives including grandparents, grandchildren, uncles, aunts, nephews, nieces, and half-siblings should also be considered. \n\nFootnote5\n†† Premature CHD signifies CHD before age 55 in males and before age 60 in female first-degree relatives, while in second-degree relatives, the corresponding ages are 50 and 55. Clinical CHD is defined by a history of an AMI, silent MI, unstable angina, coronary revascularization procedure (PCI or CABG)) or clinically significant atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease diagnosed by invasive or noninvasive testing (such as coronary angiography, stress test using treadmill, stress echocardiography, or nuclear imaging).\n\nFamilial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia:\n\nAetna considers familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia (FHH) medically necessary in any of the following:\n\nAtypical cases where no family members are available for testing; or\nFamilies with familial isolated hyperparathyroidism; or\nInfants or children under 10 years of age in whom neonatal hyperparathyroidism, neonatal severe hyperparathyroidism, and FHH are the commonest causes of parathyroid hormone-dependent hypercalcemia; or\nIndividuals with overlap in the calcium/creatinine (Ca/Cr) clearance ratio, namely between 0.01 and 0.02; or\nIndividuals with the phenotype of FHH whose parents are both normocalcemic (i.e., FHH possibly caused by a de novo CaSR mutation).\nFamilial nephrotic syndrome (NPHS1, NPHS2):\nAetna considers genetic testing for an NPHS1 mutation medically necessary for children with congenital nephrotic syndrome (nephrotic syndrome appearing within the first month of life) who are of Finnish descent or who have a family history of congenital nephrotic syndrome.  Genetic testing for NPHS1 mutations are considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for screening other persons with nephrotic syndrome and for all other indications because its effectiveness for other indications other has not been established.\nAetna considers genetic testing for an NPHS2 mutation medically necessary for children with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and for children who have a family history of SRNS.  Genetic testing for NPHS2 is considered experimental, investigational, or unproven for persons with steroid-responsive nephrotic syndrome and for all other indications because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nAetna considers genetic testing for familial nephrotic syndrome experimental, investigational, or unproven for all other indications.\n\nFragile X:\n\nAetna considers genetic testing of the FMR1 gene medically necessary for members in any of the following risk categories where the results of the test will affect a member's clinical management or reproductive decisions:\n\nIndividuals with developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)\nFootnote6\n††† (also known as premature ovarian failure); or\nIndividual with progressive cerebellar ataxia and intention tremor in individuals older than 50 years of age;\nIndividuals planning a pregnancy who have either of the following:\nA family history of fragile X syndrome, or\nA family history of unexplained developmental delay/intellectual disability, autism or primary ovarian insufficiency (POI)\nFootnote6\n†††; or\n\nFetuses of known carrier mothers.  Prenatal testing of a fetus by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling is indicated following a positive Fragile X carrier test in the mother.\n\nFootnote6\n††† POI is defined as female younger than 40 years of age with FSH levels in the postmenopausal range and at least three months of amenorrhea, oligomenorrhea or dysfunctional uterine bleeding.\n\nThe following is considered medically necessary:\n\nFragile X DNA testing for members with:\n\nA negative cytogenetic test for fragile X if they have any physical or behavioral characteristics of fragile X syndrome and have a family history of fragile X syndrome or undiagnosed developmental delay/intellectual disability;\nA phenotype that is not typical for fragile X syndrome who have a cytogenetic test that is positive for fragile X. \n\nAetna considers population-based fragile X syndrome screening of individuals who are not in any of the above-listed risk categories experimental, investigational, or unproven because its effectiveness for indications other than the ones listed above has not been established.\n\nHereditary ataxia panel:\n\nAetna considers a hereditary ataxia panel medically necessary when the following criteria are met:\n\nMember has signs and symptoms of a hereditary ataxia; and\nOther causes of ataxia have been considered and ruled out, if possible (e.g., head trauma, alcoholism, vitamin deficiencies (such as low vitamin B12), multiple sclerosis, stroke, brain tumors, ear infections); and\nClinical presentation, including completed additional lab and clinical testing, does not fit a well-described syndrome for which single-gene testing or a symptom-based small targeted panel is available; and\nIf there is a known hereditary ataxia pathogenic variant in the family, single-gene testing for that pathogenic variant has been performed and is negative.\nHereditary hearing loss panel:\n\nAetna considers genetic testing medically necessary to confirm diagnosis of hereditary hearing loss when all of the following criteria are met:\n\nEnvironmental causes has been ruled out and etiology remains unclear;

See Appendixfor information regarding antidepressant medications and augmentation therapy. \nTwo antidepressants from at least 2 different classes having different mechanisms of action at the maximally tolerated labeled dose, each used for at least 8 weeks (to qualify as an adequate antidepressant drug trial, the individual’s dose during the failed trials should have been at or above the minimal effective therapeutic dose for that antidepressant); and\nAugmentation therapy along with the primary antidepressant used for at least 8 weeks; if the augmenting agent is an antidepressant, the augmenting agent must be from a different class than the primary antidepressant. The augmenting agent should have been at or above the minimal effective therapeutic dose (which is typically the minimal labeled dose); and\nTreatment consists of a maximum of 30 sessions (5 days a week for 6 weeks) plus 6 tapering sessions (6 sessions over three weeks). Notes: Treatments beyond 36 sessions (e.g., 30 treatment sessions followed by 6 tapering sessions) may be reviewed for medical necessity. There is a lack of evidence of the effectiveness of additional sessions beyond 36 to treat \"late responders\", to solidify response, or to attain remission. There is a lack of evidence that persons who fail to respond or become refractory to one brand of TMS device will respond to another brand of TMS, theta burst stimulation (TBS), or deep TMS (dTMS) device; and\nTMS treatment is delivered by a device that is approved or cleared by the FDA for the treatment of major depressive disorder. Note: TMS treatment should generally follow the protocol and parameters specified in the manufacturer’s user manual, with modifications only as supported by the published scientific evidence base; and\nThe order for treatment (or retreatment) will be written by a psychiatrist (MD or DO) or psychiatric-mental health nurse practitioner (PMHNP) who will examine the patient and review the record and determine that TMS is indicated for use in a particular patient. In addition to patient selection, the psychiatrist or PMHNP must oversee initial patient motor threshold determinations, mapping and treatment parameter definitions and overall TMS treatment course planning for each patient. The psychiatrist or PMHNP must certify that the treatment will be given under direct supervision of this physician or PMHNP (i.e., the physician or PMHNP will be in the area and will be immediately available for each treatment). If the psychiatrist or PMHNP is not performing the daily TMS treatment sessions, then the psychiatrist or PMHNP should assign properly trained personnel who may perform the daily treatment sessions. The psychiatrist or PMHNP is also responsible for the evaluation of the patient during the course of their TMS Therapy treatment; and\nThe TMS operator will be a clinical professional who is conducting TMS Therapy under the supervision of a physician, nurse practitioner or physician assistant who is at the facility at the time of treatment. The TMS operator should possess sufficient clinical expertise to monitor the patient during the conduct of a TMS treatment session. The operator must be able to observe the patient’s physical status for the potential occurrence of adverse events, and make routine adjustments as required and consistent with product labeling, or determine circumstances under which treatment interruption or treatment termination should be considered. The TMS operator should be present in the treatment room with the patient at all times. The operator must be qualified to monitor the patient for seizure activity and to provide seizure management care.\n\nAetna considers TMS not medically necessary and experimental, investigational, or unproven in members with any of the following contraindications to TMS because the safety and effectiveness in persons with these contraindications has not been established:\n\nAbuse of substances with known abuse potential during the last 90 days; or\nActive suicidality; or\nMetal implant in or around the head (e.g., aneurysm coil or clip, metal plate, ocular implant, stent); or\nMetal or metal fragments in or around the head within 30 cm of the coil (e.g. bullets); or\nNeurological conditions (e.g., cerebrovascular disease, dementia, history of repetitive or severe head trauma, increased intracranial pressure or primary or secondary tumors in the central nervous system); or\nPresence of implanted devices (e.g., cardiac pacemaker or defibrillator, cochlear implant, deep brain stimulator, implantable infusion pump, spinal cord stimulator, vagus nerve stimulator, etc.); or\nSevere cardiovascular disease (unless member has been evaluated and cleared for TMS treatment by a cardiologist); or\nTattoos in the head or neck made with ferromagnetic-containing ink; or\nUnstable general medical disorders.\n\nAetna considers TMS retreatment medically necessary for members with depression relapse who meet all of the following criteria:\n\nThe member met initiation criteria above; and\nThe member has relapsed following TMS despite other treatment approaches (e.g., psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy), as appropriate; and\nThe member had previously had at least a 50% reduction in depressive symptoms with TMS, as documented by standardized rating scales that reliably measure depressive symptoms (e.g., Beck Depression Scale [BDI], Hamilton Depression Rating Scale [HDRS], Montgomery-Asberg Depression Rating Scale [MADRS], etc.), and this improvement was maintained for at least two months after the prior TMS treatment course; repeat TMS treatment within 60 days following the termination of the prior TMS course is considered not medically necessary.\n\nAetna considers one TMS re-mapping during a course of TMS for depression medically necessary. Additional courses of re-mapping are considered medically necessary if the member is not responding to ensure the most accurate treatment location, or if there is concern that motor threshold may have changed (for example, because of a change in medication). Note: Re-mapping does not increase the medically necessary number of TMS sessions, as treatment is provided during remapping. \n\nExperimental, Investigational, or Unproven\n\nAetna considers the following procedures experimental, investigational, or unproven because the effectiveness of these approaches has not been established:\n\nAccelerated TMS, as well as, MRI-guided TMS (repetitive and theta-burst stimulation), including but not limited to the Stanford Accelerated Intelligent Neuromodulation Therapy (SAINT), for the treatment of depression and other psychiatric/neurologic disorders\nAdjunctive use of ketamine with TMS\nCombined TMS and electroencephalography (EEG) for evaluation of unconscious state (e.g., medication-induced unconscious state, minimally conscious state, and unresponsive wakefulness syndrome) \nDelivery of TMS using a non-standard protocol with increased hertz under sedation \nNavigated TMS for motor function mapping and/or treatment planning of neurological diseases/disorders (e.g., amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, epilepsy, and resection of brain tumors)\nMagnetic e-Resonance Therapy (MeRT) for the treatment of autism, concussion, depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, and all other indications\nTMS maintenance therapy (i.e., treatment outside of the established 30 treatment sessions over 6 weeks plus six tapering sessions over 3 weeks)\nTMS for the following conditions because its value and effectiveness has not been established (not an all-inclusive list):\nAlzheimer's disease\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis\nAnxiety disorders\nAuditory verbal hallucinations\nBipolar disorder\nBlepharospasm\nBulimia nervosa\nCerebellar ataxia (including spinocerebellar ataxia type 3)\nCerebral palsy\nChronic pain including neuropathic pain (e.g., orofacial pain, and central post-stroke pain)\nCommunication and swallowing disorders (e.g., aphasia (including post-stroke aphasia), dysarthria, dysphagia (including post-stroke dysphagia), and linguistic deficits)\nComplex regional pain syndrome\nConcussion\nDifferential diagnosis of Alzheimer disease from frontotemporal dementia\nExecutive function deficits\nEpilepsy (including status epilepticus)\nCongenital hemiparesis\nDyslexia\nDystonia\nFibromyalgia\nFunctional neurological disorder\nGambling disorder\nInsomnia\nLevodopa-induced dyskinesia\nMajor depressive disorder with psychosis\nMigraine\nMood disorders\nMultiple sclerosis\nMusical obsession (stuck song syndrome)\nNeurodevelopmental disorders (e.g., attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, autism spectrum disorder, and tic disorders)\nNeuropathic pain associated with spinal cord injury\nObsessive-compulsive disorder\nPanic disorder\nParkinson disease\nPeri-partum depression\nPhantom limb pain\nPhantom pain associated with spinal cord injury\nPost-stroke fatigue\nPost-traumatic stress disorder\nPsychosis\nRestless legs syndrome\nSchizo-affective disorder\nSchizophrenia\nSmell and taste dysfunction (e.g., phantosmia and phantageusia)\nSmoking cessation\nSomatic symptom disorder (somatization disorder)\nSpasticity\nStroke treatment (e.g., motor impairment, post-stroke hemiplegia, and post-stroke spasticity)\nSubstance addiction (substance use disorders)\nTourette syndrome (see CPB 0480 -

This procedure entails placement of an electromagnetic coil on the scalp; high-intensity electrical current is rapidly turned on and off in the coil through the discharge of capacitors.  Depending on stimulation parameters (frequency, intensity, pulse duration, stimulation site), repetitive TMS (rTMS) to specific cortical regions can either increase or decrease the excitability of the affected brain structures.\n\nTranscranial magnetic stimulation has been investigated in the treatment of various psychiatric disorders, especially depression.  This procedure is usually carried out in an outpatient setting.  In contrast to electroconvulsive therapy, TMS does not require anesthesia or analgesia. Furthermore, it does not affect memory and usually does not cause seizures.  However, the available peer-reviewed medical literature has not established the effectiveness of rTMS in the treatment of psychiatric disorders other than major depression. In addition, more research is needed to ascertain the roles of various stimulation parameters of rTMS for its optimal outcome as well as its long-term effectiveness in the treatment of psychiatric disorders.\n\nAddiction / Substance Use Disorders\n\nGorelick et al (2014) noted that TMS is still in the early stages of study as addiction treatment. These researchers identified 19 human studies using repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to manipulate drug craving or use, which exposed a total of 316 adults to active rTMS.  Nine studies involved tobacco, 6 alcohol, 3 cocaine, and 1 methamphetamine.  The majority of studies targeted high-frequency (5 to 20 Hz; expected to stimulate neuronal activity) rTMS pulses to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex.  Only 5 studies were controlled clinical trials: 2 of 4 nicotine trials found decreased cigarette smoking; the cocaine trial found decreased cocaine use.  Many aspects of optimal treatment remain unknown, including rTMS parameters, duration of treatment, relationship to cue-induced craving, and concomitant treatment.  The mechanisms of rTMS potential therapeutic action in treating addictions are poorly understood, but may involve increased dopamine and glutamate function in cortico-mesolimbic brain circuits and modulation of neural activity in brain circuits that mediate cognitive processes relevant to addiction, such as response inhibition, selective attention, and reactivity to drug-associated cues.  The authors concluded that rTMS treatment of addiction must be considered experimental at this time, but appears to have a promising future.Makani and associates (2017) stated that addiction and related disorders are devastating with their tremendous social, psychological, and physical consequences for which development of optimally effective treatments are long overdue; rTMS is relatively safe and is becoming an emerging therapeutic tool for these conditions.  These investigators carried out a systematic review using PubMed, PsycINFO, PsychiatryOnline and Cochrane Library ranging from year 2001 to 2017.  They retrieved 70 related articles of which, based on the Strength of Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) guidelines, 33 indicated Level-1 study quality and class-B strength of recommendation for rTMS in nicotine addiction (effective in 218/289 subjects who received rTMS as found in 11 studies).  Level-2/Class-B evidence was found for alcohol and cocaine addictions (alcohol: effective in 126/193 subjects who received rTMS as found in 8 studies; cocaine: effective in 86/128 subjects, as found in 5 studies).  For food cravings, Level-3/Class-B evidence was noted (effective in 134/169, found in 7 studies).  However, the evidence was limited to Level-3/Class-C for heroin (10/20 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 1 study), methamphetamine (33/48 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 2 studies), cannabis (18/18 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 1 study), and pathological gambling (31/31 subjects received active rTMS, effective in 2 studies).  The authors concluded that rTMS may serve as an emerging therapeutic option for addiction and related disorders.  The major voids in this field include important methodological limitations and dearth of knowledge about precise mechanism of action that need to be addressed in the future studies.\n\nTorres-Castano and colleagues (2021) noted that long-term cocaine use is associated with cognitive deficits and neuro-psychiatric pathologies; and rTMS is an emerging therapeutic strategy relating to changes in brain activity.  It stimulates the prefrontal cortex and is involved in inhibitory cognitive control, decision-making and care.  In a systematic review, these investigators examined the evidence on the safety, effectiveness, and cost-effectiveness of rTMS for the treatment of cocaine addiction.  They carried out a systematic review of the literature.  The following electronic databases were consulted from inception to October 2020: Medline, Embase, CINAHL, PsycINFO, Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials and Web of Science; RCTs, non-RCTs and case-series and full economic evaluations were included.  A total of 12 studies were included.  No identified study reported data on cost-effectiveness.  Significant results of the effectiveness of TMS have been observed in terms of the reduction of craving to consume and the number of doses consumed.  No serious adverse effects have been observed.  The authors concluded that despite the low quality of the studies, the first results were observed in terms of reduction of cocaine use and craving.  In any case, this effect was considered moderate.  Since not all studies were RCTs, and the fact that the included studies had small sample sizes and a short follow-up, the evidence obtained did not allow conclusive statements.  Moreover, these researchers stated that in order to consider TMS as a procedure likely to be recommended for the treatment of cocaine addiction, controlled clinical trials are needed to be performed under rigorous standards with respect, for example, to the characterization of the participants, the randomization and the blinding procedures.  In this regard, there are a number of variables specific to the technique that make it difficult to obtain the “perfect” protocol for each subject and to obtain the best possible results.  In the future, it will be necessary to conduct comparative studies to evaluate these key variables, among which it is necessary to mention the target region to be stimulated, the methods to locate the target and the type of coil to be used, the number and frequency of the pulses and the number of sessions.\n\nKedzior and colleagues (2018) stated that deep TMS (DTMS) is a non-invasive method of stimulating widespread cortical areas and, presumably, deeper neural networks.  In a systematic review, these researchers examined the effects of DTMS in the treatment of substance use disorders (SUD).  Electronic literature search (PsycInfo, Medline until April 2017) identified k = 9 studies (k = 4 RCTs, with inactive sham and k = 5 open-label studies).  DTMS was most commonly applied using HF/intensity (10 to 20 Hz/100 to 120 % of the resting motor threshold, MT) protocols for 10 to 20 daily sessions in cases with alcohol, nicotine or cocaine use disorders.  The outcome measures were craving and dependence (according to standardized scales) or consumption (frequency, abstinence or results of biological assays) at the end of the daily treatment phases and at the last follow-up.  Acute and longer-term (6 to 12 months) reductions in alcohol craving were observed after 20 sessions (20-Hz, 120 % MT) relative to baseline in k = 4 open-label studies with co-morbid SUD and MDD.  In k = 2 RCTs without MDD, alcohol consumption acutely decreased after 10 to 12 sessions (10 to 20 Hz, 100 to 120 % MT) relative to baseline or to sham.  Alcohol craving was reduced only after HF/intensity DTMS (20-Hz, 120 % MT) relative to sham in k = 1 RCT.  Nicotine consumption was reduced and abstinence was increased after 13 sessions (10-Hz, 120 % MT) and at the 6-month follow-up relative to sham in k = 1 RCT.  Cocaine craving was reduced after 12 sessions (15-Hz, 100 % MT) and at the 2-month follow-up relative to baseline in k = 1 open-label study while consumption was reduced after 12 sessions (10-Hz, 100 % MT) relative to baseline but not to sham in k = 1 RCT.  The authors concluded that HF-DTMS may be effective at treating some SUD both acutely and in the longer-term.  These researchers stated that large RCTs with inactive sham are needed to determine the efficacy and the optimal stimulation parameters of DTMS for the treatment of SUD.\n\nBormann et al (2024) stated that TMS and transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) have evidence for their potential in the treatment of SUD.  Medication for addiction treatment (MAT) is under-utilized and not always effective.  These researchers identified RCTs and case studies that examined the effectiveness of TMS or tDCS used concurrently with MAT in the treatment of SUD.  They carried out a systematic review of published literature following PRISMA guidelines on June 1, 2023 by a medical librarian.  Craving-related scales were extracted for an effect size calculation.  The Physiotherapy Evidence Database (PEDro) scale assessed study quality.  A total of 8 studies (7 RCTs, 1 case study) including 253 individuals were published from 2015 to 2022, 5 of which had available data for meta-analysis.  TMS or tDCS combined with MAT significantly reduced craving-related measures relative to sham stimulation (Hedges' g = -0.42, CI: -0.73 to -0.11, p < 0.01).  Opioid use disorder, methadone, and the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex were the most commonly studied SUD, MAT, and target region.  The authors concluded that this review showed a significant effect; however, was limited by a small number of studies with heterogeneous methodology across intervention methods and SUDs.  These researchers stated that additional studies are needed to examine the clinical impact and mechanisms of combined brain stimulation and pharmacotherapy.\n\nGambling Disorder\n\nConcerto et al (2023) stated that gambling disorder (GD) is a behavioral addiction listed within the diagnostic category of substance-related and addictive disorders.  Recently, TMS, which non-invasively stimulates the brain and has neuro-modulatory properties, has emerged as an innovative treatment tool for GD; therefore, offering a new option for the management of this complex disorder. In a systematic review, these investigators examined the effectiveness of TMS as a possible non-pharmacological treatment for GD.  They carried out an exhaustive search across the Medline, Web of Science, and Embase databases using a specific search string related to GD and TMS.  A total of 20 studies were selected for full-text examination, out of which 8 met the inclusion criteria and were analyzed in the present review.  This review included 8 studies: 3 RCTs, 3 non-controlled studies, 1 case-series study, and 1 case-report.  Two cross-over RCTs described a decrease in craving after high-frequency (excitatory), rTMS over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) and the medial prefrontal cortex (PFC), respectively; another study applying low-frequency (inhibitory) rTMS on the right DLPFC did not find any positive effect on craving.  Among uncontrolled studies, 1 showed the beneficial effect of high-frequency rTMS over the left DLPFC, while another showed the effectiveness of a continuous theta burst stimulation protocol directed over the pre-supplementary motor area, bilaterally.  The authors concluded that the included studies demonstrated the promising effect of excitatory stimulation over the left PFC.  Moreover, these researchers stated that further investigation is needed.  They stated that future research should place greater emphasis on characterizing study samples based on specific symptoms and further longitudinal RCTs should be conducted to monitor the safety and long-term effects of non-invasive brain stimulation techniques in GD and other addiction disorders.\n\nThe authors stated that this systematic review had several drawbacks.  The inclusion of diverse clinical populations, as well as the inclusion of case reports and case series, the high risk of bias in multiple domains of the included studies, and the concurrent use of other treatments introduce limitations and cofounding factors regarding treatment effectiveness.  In particular, the placebo effect may have influenced many of the results obtained, and randomized sham control trials are needed in future.\n\nAmyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis\n\nIn a review on the diagnosis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Elman and McCluskey (2010) stated that rTMS remains a largely experimental technique and is not used routinely for clinical diagnosis.  In a Cochrane review on rTMS for the treatment of ALS or motor neuron disease, Guo et al (2011) concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence to draw conclusions about the safety and effectiveness of rTMS in the treatment of ALS.  They noted that further studies may be helpful if their potential benefit is weighed against the impact of participation in a RCT on people with ALS.\n\nAnxiety Disorders\n\nPrasko et al (2007) examined if rTMS would facilitate effect of serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SRIs) in patients with panic disorder (n = 15).  Patients suffering from panic disorder resistant to SRI therapy were randomly assigned to either active or to sham rTMS.  The objective of the study was to compare the 2- and 4-weeks effectiveness of the 10 sessions low-frequency rTMS with sham rTMS add on SRI therapy.  These researchers used 1-Hz, 30-min rTMS, 110 % of motor threshold administered over the right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC).  The same time schedule was used for sham administration.  Psychopathology was evaluated by means of the rating scales CGI, HAMA, PDSS and BAI before the treatment, immediately after the experimental treatment, and 2 weeks after the experimental treatment by an independent reviewer.  Both groups improved during the study period but the treatment effect did not differ between groups in any of the instruments.  The authors concluded that low-frequency rTMS administered over the right dorso-lateral prefrontal cortex after 10 sessions did not differ from sham rTMS add on SRIs in patients with panic disorder.\n\nPigot and colleagues (2008) noted that rTMS has also been investigated for the treatment of some anxiety disorders (e.g., obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder and panic disorder).  While anecdotal reports and open studies have suggested a therapeutic role for rTMS in anxiety disorders, controlled studies, which have varied greatly in terms of rTMS administration, have not shown it to be superior to placebo.  Furthermore, reports in animal models of anxiety have not been consistent.  Thus, there is currently no convincing evidence for the clinical role of rTMS in the treatment of anxiety disorders.  The authors stated that more research is needed, drawing on advances in the understanding of pathological neurocircuitry in anxiety disorders and the mechanisms of action by which rTMS may alter that neurocircuitry.  In a review on OCD, Abramowitz and colleagues (2009) stated that although rTMS has not been extensively assessed in this disorder, available data do not support its therapeutic efficacy for this condition.\n\nBerlim et al (2014) stated that rTMS applied to the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) has yielded promising results as a treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD).  However, to-date, no quantitative review of its clinical utility has been published.  These investigators searched for randomized and sham-controlled trials from 1995 to March 2013 using MEDLINE, Embase, PsycINFO, CENTRAL, and SCOPUS.  They then performed an exploratory random effects meta-analysis.  Studies on rTMS applied to the right DLPFC included 64 adults with PTSD.  The pooled Hedges g effect size for pre- and post-changes in clinician-rated and self-reported PTSD symptoms were, respectively, 1.65 (p < 0.001) and 1.91 (p < 0.001), indicating significant and large-sized differences in outcome favoring active rTMS.  Also, there were significant pre- and post-decreases with active rTMS in overall anxiety (Hedges g = 1.24; p = 0.02) and depressive (Hedges g = 0.85; p < 0.001) symptoms.  Drop-out rates at study end did not differ between active and sham rTMS groups.  Regarding rTMS applied to the left DLPFC, there was only 1 study published to-date (using a high frequency protocol), and its results showed that active rTMS seems to be superior overall to sham rTMS.  The authors concluded that this exploratory meta-analysis showed that active rTMS applied to the DLPFC seems to be effective and acceptable for treating PTSD.  However, they stated that the small number of subjects included in the analyses limits the generalizability of these findings.  They stated that future studies should include larger samples and deliver optimized stimulation parameters.\n\nAn assessment by the Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health (CADTH, 2014) concluded that, for PTSD, there is early evidence that TMS may improve clinical outcomes. For generalized anxiety disorder, no evidence was found.\n\nParikh and colleagues (2022) carried out a systematic review and meta-analysis of repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) in adults with generalized anxiety disorder (GAD).  These investigators conducted a systematic literature review using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Pre- and post-treatment anxiety scores were extracted, and a random-effects meta-analysis was performed to determine the magnitude of improvement (SMD).  Standard assessments of heterogeneity (e.g., Q-statistic, I2, and τ 2) and publication bias were performed.  The initial search resulted in 3,194 citations, of which 6 studies were included in the meta-analysis.  A total of 152 patients were studied, including 97 patients who received active treatment and 55 who received sham treatment, and heterogeneity was modest (I2 = 13.32, Q = 5.77).  In patients with GAD, rTMS produced a SMD of -1.857 (CI: -2.219 to -1.494; p < 0.001) with a prediction interval of -2.55 to -1.16.  The authors concluded that the findings of this review suggested a robust effect of rTMS in GAD in the context of limited, heterogenous studies.  Moreover, these researchers stated that rigorously designed RCTs of rTMS for GAD and related anxiety disorders are urgently needed.  These studies will provide opportunities for biomarker development and integration of concurrent evidence-based psychotherapy to maximize results.\n\nAutism\n\nIn a review on autism, Levy et al (2009) stated that biologically based treatments include anti-infectives, chelation medications, gastro-intestinal medications, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, off-label drugs (e.g., secretin), and intravenous immunoglobulins.  Non-biologically based treatments include auditory integration training, chiropractic therapy, cranio-sacral manipulation, facilitated communication, interactive metronome, and transcranial stimulation.  However, few studies have addressed the safety and effectiveness of most of these treatments.\n\nMasuda and colleagues (2019) noted that cortical excitation/inhibition (E/I) imbalances contribute to various clinical symptoms observed in autism spectrum disorder (ASD).  However, the detailed pathophysiologic underpinning of E/I imbalance remains uncertain; TMS motor-evoked potentials (MEP) are a non-invasive tool for examining cortical inhibition in ASD.  These investigators carried out a systematic review on TMS neurophysiology in motor cortex (M1) such as MEPs and short-interval intracortical inhibition (SICI) between individuals with ASD and controls.  Out of 538 initial records, these investigators identified 6 articles; 5 studies measured MEP, where 4 studies measured SICI.  There were no differences in MEP amplitudes between the 2 groups, whereas SICI was likely to be reduced in individuals with ASD compared with controls.  Notably, SICI largely reflects GABA(A) receptor-mediated function.  Conversely, other magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) and post-mortem methodologies assess GABA levels.  The present review demonstrated that there may be neurophysiological deficits in GABA receptor-mediated function in ASD.  The authors concluded that reduced GABAergic function in the neural circuits could underlie the E/I imbalance in ASD, which may be related to the pathophysiology of clinical symptoms of ASD.  Thus, a novel treatment that targets the neural circuits related to GABA(A) receptor-mediated function in regions involved in the pathophysiology of ASD may be promising.\n\nThe authors stated that the main drawback of this systematic review was the small sample size for each parameter.  Also, each study included a limited number of individuals, which did not allow these investigators to control the confounding effects of the age, gender, accompanied medication, or co-morbidity such as other neurodevelopmental disorders.  Further, in this study, because of the limited number of articles examining the non-motor areas in ASD, only M1 could be systematically reviewed.  These researchers stated that further well-designed studies addressing current limitations and the knowledge gap are needed.\n\nCerebellar Neuromodulation for the Treatment of Autism Spectrum Disorders\n\nElandaloussi et al (2025) noted that ASD is a complex neurodevelopmental condition characterized by social atypicalities and repetitive behaviors.  Growing evidence suggests that alterations in brain networks may contribute to ASD symptoms.  The cerebellum has emerged as a potential key player in ASD.  Non-invasive neuromodulation techniques, such as tDCS or rTMS offer a promising approach for modulating brain activity and potentially alleviating ASD symptoms.  Furthermore, pre-clinical studies in rodents further emphasized the therapeutic effect of cerebellar stimulation to target autism-related symptoms.  These investigators reviewed both clinical and pre-clinical studies aiming to modulate cerebellar circuits to improve symptoms of ASD.  They identified 10 pertinent studies examining the effect of cerebellar neuromodulation in human and pre-clinical models.  Posterior cerebellar tDCS represented the most commonly employed neuromodulation method and suggested that cerebellar tDCS can result in improvements in symptoms of ASD and restore cerebellar connectivity in individuals with ASD.  In neurotypical participants, there is evidence that cerebellar tDCS can enhance social cognitive abilities.  These results were in line with pre-clinical studies, suggesting that chemo-genetic stimulation can modulate cerebellar circuits involved in ASD and improve related behaviors.  The authors concluded that further investigations are needed to establish standardized protocols, evaluate long-term effects, and examine the underlying mechanisms of cerebellar stimulation; they examined research questions that need to be addressed before launching large-scale randomized clinical trials.\n\nBipolar Disorder\n\nYang and colleagues (2019) noted that patients with bipolar disorder (BD) present wide-spread and significant neurocognitive impairments during all stages of the disorder; rTMS has been tried to improve clinical outcomes in common psychiatric diseases, such as depression, anxiety disorders, schizophrenia, and BD. Whether rTMS can improve cognitive function in BD patients remains unclear.  These researchers examined the effects of rTMS on cognitive function in patients with BD.  A total of 52 eligible subjects with BD were randomly assigned to receive active or sham rTMS via high-speed magnetic stimulator with a figure-of-eight coil for 10 consecutive days.  In the active rTMS group, a total of 25,000 stimuli were applied over the left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex at 110 % of the motor threshold.  The sham group received corresponding sham stimulation.  Clinical manifestations and cognitive functions were assessed using a modified 24-item HDRS, the Young Mania Rating Scale (YMRS), and the MATRICS Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB).  These investigators found that 10 consecutive days of HF- rTMS improved scores on the Wechsler Memory Scale-III Spatial Span, and the MCCB Category Fluency subtest, without intolerable adverse effects.  No significant differences in HDRS or YMRS scores were found between groups.  The authors concluded that short-term rTMS could improve cognitive function in BD patients.  The main drawbacks of this study were its relatively small sample size (n = 52), the lack of follow-up after the intervention, and the effect of the drug on cognitive function in subjects was not excluded.\n\nIn a triple-blinded, randomized, placebo-control, pilot study,  McIntyre and colleagues (2021) examined if rTMS would improve cognitive function in adults with BD.  Subjects (aged 18 to 60 years) with a diagnosis of DSM-5-defined BD (I or II) were recruited and randomized (n = 36) to receive either a sham treatment (n = 20) or an active rTMS treatment (n = 16).  Patients completed the Measurement and Treatment Research to Improve Cognition in Schizophrenia (MATRICS) Consensus Cognitive Battery (MCCB) at baseline and 1 to 2 weeks after the rTMS intervention.  A significant group by time interaction was observed in the Hopkins Verbal Learning Test-Revised (HVLT-R), (F (1, 34) = 17.0, p < 0.001, partial η2 = 0.33).  Post-hoc analysis revealed that although both groups did not significantly differ at baseline (p = 0.58), patients in the active rTMS group significantly improved following neurostimulation (p = 0.02) for HVLT-R.  Moreover, within-subject analysis indicated that the active rTMS group significantly improved in score from pre-treatment to post-treatment (p < 0.001), while the sham group did not improve (p = 0.94) for HVLT-R.  No significant differences were observed in the other cognitive measures.  The authors concluded that this pilot study, which was intended to establish feasibility, suggested that rTMS may offer benefit in select domains of cognitive functioning in BD.  None of the measures across sub-domains revealed a dyscognitive effect.  Moreover, these investigators stated that this study had a small sample (n = 16 in the rTMS group); larger, rigorous studies are needed to replicate and extend results of this pilot study.\n\nBlepharospasm\nIn a prospective, randomized, sham-controlled, observer-blinded study, Kranz et al (2010) examined the effects of rTMS on benign essential blepharospasm (BEB).  In 12 patients with BEB, these investigators evaluated the effects of a 15-min session of low-frequency (0.2 Hz) rTMS over the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) with stimulation intensities at 100 % active motor threshold with 3 stimulation coils: a conventional circular coil (C-coil), a sham coil (S-coil), and a Hesed coil (H-coil, which allows stimulation of deeper brain regions.  \na conventional circular coil (C-coil),\na sham coil (S-coil), and\na Hesed coil (H-coil, which allows stimulation of deeper brain regions. \n\nPrimary outcome was the clinical effects on BEB (blink rate, number of spasms rated by a blinded physician and patient rating before, immediately after, and 1 hour after stimulation); secondary outcome was the blink reflex recovery curve.  Subjective stimulation comfort was similar for each coil with no stimulation-associated adverse events.  Stimulation with the H- and C-coils resulted in a significant improvement in all 3 outcome measures and was still detectable in physician rating and patient rating 1-hr after stimulation.  S-coil stimulation had no effects.  The active motor threshold was significantly lower for the H-coil compared to the other 2 coils.  The authors concluded that rTMS could be used as a therapeutic tool in BEB.  Moreover, they noted that compared to the well-established and long-lasting effects of botulinum toxin and in view of the time-consuming nature of rTMS and its short-lasting effects, it should not be used in routine clinical setting at this stage.  Furthermore, they stated that further studies will be necessary to show whether repeated stimulation applications result in lasting clinical effects.\n\nBulimia Nervosa\n\nIn a single-center, randomized, double-blind, sham-controlled study, Walpoth et al (2008) examined the effects of rTMS in bulimia nervosa (BN).  A total of 14 women meeting DSM-IV criteria for BN were included in the study.  In order to exclude patients highly responsive to placebo, all patients were first submitted to a 1-week sham treatment.  Randomization was followed by 3 weeks of active treatment or sham stimulation.  The main outcome was the change in binges and purges.  Secondary outcome variables were the decrease of the HDRS, the BDI and the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) over time.  The average number of bi",

These policies are provided for informational purposes, and do not constitute medical advice. Treating physicians and health care providers are solely responsible for determining what care to provide to their patients. Members should always consult their physician before making any decisions about medical care.\n\nOur Medical Policies and Medical Benefit Drug Policies express our determination of whether a health service (e.g., test, drug, device, or procedure) is proven to be effective based on the published clinical evidence. They are also used to decide whether a given health service is medically necessary. Services determined to be experimental, investigational, unproven, or not medically necessary by the clinical evidence are typically not covered\n\nBenefit coverage for health services is determined by the member specific benefit plan document, such as a Certificate of Coverage, Schedule of Benefits, or Summary Plan Description, and applicable laws that may require coverage for a specific service. The member specific benefit plan document identifies which services are covered, which are excluded, and which are subject to limitations. In the event of a conflict, the member specific benefit plan document supersedes these policies and guidelines.\n\nFor California members, note that the materials provided to you are guidelines used by this plan to authorize, modify, or deny care for persons with similar illnesses or conditions. Specific care and treatment may vary depending on individual need and the benefits covered under your contract.\n\nMedical Policies and Medical Benefit Drug Policies are developed as needed, regularly reviewed and updated, and subject to change. They represent a portion of the resources used to support UnitedHealthcare coverage decision making. The information presented in these policies and guidelines is believed to be accurate and current as of the date of publication and is provided on an \"AS IS\" basis. Additionally, UnitedHealthcare may use tools developed by third parties, such as the InterQual® criteria, to assist us in administering health benefits. The InterQual® criteria are intended to be used in connection with the independent professional medical judgment of a qualified health care provider and do not constitute the practice of medicine or medical advice. Providers may review the InterQual® criteria here.\n\nUnitedHealthcare's Medical Policies and Medical Benefit Drug Policies do not include notations regarding prior authorization requirements. View the services that are subject to notification/prior authorization requirements.\n\nMedical Policies and Medical Benefit Drug Policies are the property of UnitedHealthcare. Unauthorized copying, use, and distribution of this information are strictly prohibited.

Please update your browser if the service fails to run our website. Acknowledgement Medical Policies We have developed medical policies that serve as one of the sets of guidelines for coverage decisions. Benefit plans vary in coverage and some plans may not provide coverage for certain services discussed in the medical policies. Coverage decisions are subject to all terms and conditions of the applicable benefit plan, including specific exclusions and limitations, and to applicable state and/or federal law. Medical policy does not constitute plan authorization, nor is it an explanation of benefits. Medical policies can be highly technical and complex and are provided here for informational purposes. The medical policies do not constitute medical advice or medical care. Treating health care professionals are solely responsible for diagnosis, treatment and medical advice. Members should discuss the information in the medical policies with their treating health care professionals. Medical technology is constantly evolving and these medical policies are subject to change without notice, although we will use good faith efforts to provide advance notice of changes that could have a negative impact on benefits. Additional medical policies may be developed from time to time and some may be withdrawn from use. The medical policies generally apply to all of the Plan&rsquo;s fully-insured benefits plans, although some local variations may exist. Additionally, some benefit plans administered by the Plan such as some self-funded employer plans or governmental plans, may not utilize the Plan&rsquo;s medical policy. Members should contact their local customer service representative for specific coverage information. The doctors, hospitals, and other providers which are part of the network of providers referred to in this document are independent contractors who exercise independent judgment and over whom we have no control or right of control. They are not agents or employees of the Plan. If you would like to request a hard copy of an individual medical policy, please contact the member's health plan at the number on the back of their identification card. Clinical UM Guidelines We have developed clinical UM guidelines that serve as one of the sets of guidelines for coverage decisions. We are also licensed to use MCG guidelines to guide utilization management decisions. This may include but is not limited to decisions involving pre-certification, inpatient review, level of care, discharge planning and retrospective review. The MCG guidelines we are licensed to use include ((1) Inpatient & Surgical Care (ISC), (2) General Recovery Care (GRG), (3) Recovery Facility Care (RFC), (4) Chronic Care (CC) and (5) Behavioral Health Care Guidelines (BHG). We also have the right to customize MCG guidelines based on determinations by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee (MPTAC). Benefit plans vary in coverage and some plans may not provide coverage for certain services discussed in the clinical UM guidelines. Coverage decisions are subject to all terms and conditions of the applicable benefit plan, including specific exclusions and limitations, and to applicable state and/or federal law. A clinical UM guideline does not constitute plan authorization, nor is it an explanation of benefits. Clinical UM guidelines can be highly technical and complex and are provided here for informational purposes. These guidelines do not constitute medical advice or medical care. Treating health care providers are solely responsible for diagnosis, treatment and medical advice. Members should discuss the information in the clinical UM guideline with their treating health care providers. The clinical UM guidelines published on this web site represent the clinical UM guidelines currently available to all health plans throughout our enterprise. These guidelines address the medical necessity of existing, generally accepted services, technologies and drugs. Because local practice patterns, claims systems and benefit designs vary, a local plan may choose whether to implement a particular clinical UM guideline. While the clinical UM guidelines developed by us are published on this web site, the licensed standard and customized MCG guidelines are proprietary to MCG and are not published on the Internet site. Medical technology is constantly evolving and clinical UM guidelines are subject to change without notice. Additional clinical UM guidelines may be developed from time to time and some may be withdrawn from use. Members should contact their local customer service representative for specific coverage information. The doctors, hospitals, and other providers which are part of the network of providers referred to in this document are independent contractors who exercise independent judgment and over whom we have no control or right of control. They are not agents or employees of the Plan. If you would like to request a hard copy of an individual clinical UM guideline or MCG guideline, please contact the member's health plan at the number on the back of their identification card.

Independence's Policy Bulletins should not be construed as providing medical advice or treatment or guaranteeing the outcome or results of any medical services/treatments and/or procedures. If members have a specific question about their medical condition, they should consult with their provider.\nProviders are responsible for providing medical advice and treatment, are independent contractors, and are not employees or agents of Independence.\nPolicy Bulletins are written with medical terminology and in a style common to scientific literature and convention.\nThe Policy Bulletins are used in making decisions as to medical necessity only and do not describe or consider individual benefits. As a result, they do not guarantee coverage of services or guarantee payment. If you are an Independence member, please refer to your specific benefit plan documents for the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of your coverage. Benefits may vary based on the type of program (HMO, PPO, or other) as well as the benefit design selected by an employer or group (i.e., health and welfare fund, school district).\nIndependence makes decisions on coverage considering the Policy Bulletins, benefit plan documents, and the member's medical history and condition.\nPolicy Bulletins are compliant with all applicable laws and regulations, standards of regulatory and accreditation agencies (e.g., NCQA), and, when applicable, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS).\nThe Policy Bulletins describe the status of medical technology at the time the Bulletins were developed. Since that time, new technology may have emerged or new medical literature may have been published.

The conclusion that a particular service or supply is medically necessary does not constitute a representation or warranty that this service or supply is covered for a particular member. The member's benefit plan determines coverage. Some plans exclude coverage for services or supplies that are considered medically necessary.\n\nThe medical policies contained within this website do not apply to Medicare Advantage network members.

The purpose of the Horizon Medical Policy Manual is to provide clinical policies applicable to the administration of health benefits insured or administered by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, Horizon Healthcare of New Jersey, Inc., Horizon Insurance Company, and Healthier New Jersey Insurance Company (collectively “Horizon BCBSNJ”), either directly or through one of their delegated vendors.\n\nIf the benefits available to a member pursuant to the member’s benefit plan differ from what is stated in a medical policy, the benefit plan prevails.\n\nAlthough a service, supply, or procedure may be medically necessary, it nevertheless may be subject to limitations and/or exclusions under a member’s benefit plan.\n\nIf a service, treatment, procedure, equipment, device, supply, or drug is not covered, and if the member nevertheless proceeds to obtain any of them, the member may be responsible for the cost to the extent permitted under the member’s benefit plan and applicable law. For information about their benefits and payment of those benefits, the member should consult their plan document.\n\nThe policies in this database are not intended to direct the course of clinical care, and they do not replace a physician’s or other health care professional’s independent clinical judgment or duty to exercise special knowledge and skill in the treatment of Horizon BCBSNJ members. Decisions regarding treatment and treatment plans are the responsibility of physicians and other health care professionals. Horizon BCBSNJ is not responsible for, does not provide, and does not hold itself out as a provider of medical care. Physicians and other health care professionals remain responsible for the quality and type of health care services provided to a Horizon BCBSNJ member.\n\nHorizon BCBSNJ medical policies do not constitute medical advice, authorization, certification, approval, explanation of benefits, offer of coverage, contract, or a guarantee of payment. Payment is determined based on all terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of the member’s benefit plan, including the medical necessity of the services provided; the member’s eligibility at the time the services are provided; the agreement between the physician or other health care professional and Horizon BCBSNJ, if applicable; and the out-of-network fee schedule for the member’s benefit plan, if applicable.\n\nThe medical policies are written taking into consideration information from such sources as applicable Federal and State regulations, evidence-based scientific literature, standards of practice, and opinions of community physicians and professional societies. Although the medical policies are specifically written to address the clinical circumstances of the majority of people, Horizon BCBSNJ will consider an individual’s unique clinical circumstances, as well as the sources noted in the respective medical policies, when making these decisions on a case-by-case basis.\n\nMedical policies are highly technical and are designed for use by Horizon BCBSNJ professional staff in making coverage determinations and by physicians and other health care professionals in understanding those decisions. Members who are provided with a copy of a medical policy should discuss the medical policy with their treating provider and should refer to their specific benefit plan for the terms, conditions, limitations, and exclusions of their coverage.\n\nThe Horizon BCBSNJ Medical Policy Manual is proprietary. Horizon BCBSNJ reserves the right to update or change the contents of this Medical Policy Manual without notice, as the law allows. Horizon BCBSNJ makes benefit determinations based on the medical policies in existence at the time Horizon BCBSNJ receives a request (e.g., prior authorization or prior determination) or based on the actual date of service on a claim for the service, treatment, procedure, equipment, device, supply, or drug. Horizon BCBSNJ will not later revise its benefit determinations as the result of any subsequent updates or changes in medical policy.\n\nHorizon BCBSNJ has various categories of medical policies. Policy criteria may also vary by line of business, and notes in the respective policies will indicate the specific guidance. In addition, it should be noted that, in addition to this Medical Policy Manual, Horizon BCBSNJ’s delegated vendors also maintain libraries of medical policies that have been reviewed and adopted by Horizon BCBSNJ.\n\nThe Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield pharmacy policy guidelines are available at\n\nhttps://www.myprime.com/v/HBCBSNJ/COMMERCIAL/NJCLASSIC/en/forms/coverage-determination/prior-authorization.html for Classic formulary;\nhttps://www.myprime.com/v/HBCBSNJ/COMMERCIAL/NJCLASSIC/en/forms/coverage-determination/prior-authorization.html for Classic formulary; opens a dialog window\n‌\n\nhttps://www.myprime.com/v/HBCBSNJ/COMMERCIAL/NJIADVANT/en/forms/coverage-determination/prior-authorization.html for Classic with Health Insurance Marketplace formulary;\nhttps://www.myprime.com/v/HBCBSNJ/COMMERCIAL/NJIADVANT/en/forms/coverage-determination/prior-authorization.html for Classic with Health Insurance Marketplace formulary; opens a dialog window\n‌\n\nhttps://www.myprime.com/content/dam/prime/memberportal/forms/2019/FullyQualified/Other/ALL/HBCBSNJ/MEDICARE_D/NJMBNGCPPO/Prior_Authorization_Criteria.pdf for Medicare Part D formulary\nhttps://www.myprime.com/content/dam/prime/memberportal/forms/2019/FullyQualified/Other/ALL/HBCBSNJ/MEDICARE_D/NJMBNGCPPO/Prior_Authorization_Criteria.pdf for Medicare Part D formulary opens a dialog window\n‌\n\nhttps://www.myprime.com/content/dam/prime/memberportal/forms/2019/FullyQualified/Other/ALL/HBCBSNJ/MEDICARE_D/NJSNPHMO/Prior_Authorization_Criteria.pdf for Medicare DSNP formulary\nhttps://www.myprime.com/content/dam/prime/memberportal/forms/2019/FullyQualified/Other/ALL/HBCBSNJ/MEDICARE_D/NJSNPHMO/Prior_Authorization_Criteria.pdf for Medicare DSNP formulary opens a dialog window\n‌\n\nHorizon NJ Health policies (Medicaid) are available at https://services3.horizon-bcbsnj.com/ddn/NJhealthWeb.nsf\n\nHorizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey is an independent licensee of the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association.\n\n \n‌\n‌\n‌\n‌\n‌\n\nThis website is operated by Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey and is not New Jersey’s Health Insurance Marketplace.

The Guidelines and Pathways are designed to evaluate and direct the appropriate utilization of certain health care services. They are based on data from peer-reviewed scientific literature, from criteria developed by specialty societies, and from guidelines adopted by other health care organizations. Access to these Guidelines and Pathways is being provided for informational purposes only. Although Carelon has a process for updating its Guidelines and Pathways on a regular basis, due to the rapidly evolving nature of medicine, these Guidelines and Pathways may not always reflect the most current evidence on a particular service or treatment.\n\nThe Guidelines and Pathways are protected by copyright of Carelon as permitted by and to the full extent of the law. These rights are not released, transferred, or assigned as a result of allowing access. You agree that you do not have any ownership rights to the Guidelines and Pathways and that you are expressly prohibited from selling, assigning, leasing, licensing, reproducing, or distributing the Guidelines and Pathways unless authorized in writing by Carelon.\n\nUse of the Guidelines by any external AI entity without the express written permission of Carelon is prohibited.\n\nThe Guidelines and Pathways do not constitute medical advice and/or medical care and do not guarantee results or outcomes. The Guidelines and Pathways are not a substitute for the experience and judgment of a physician or other health care professionals. Any clinician seeking to apply or consult the Guidelines or Pathways is expected to use independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances to determine any patient’s care or treatment. The Guidelines and Pathways do not address coverage, benefit, or other plan specific issues.\n\nThe Guidelines and Pathways are provided “as is” without warranty of any kind, either expressed or implied. The search feature is available for convenience only. Lack of search results for a code or keyword does not imply it is not applicable to Carelon guidelines or that prior authorization is not required. Guidelines are subject to change. They should not be accessed via bookmarks or saved links as doing so may result in inaccurate information. Carelon disclaims all responsibility for any consequences or liability attributable or related to any use, nonuse, or interpretation of information contained in the Guidelines.\n\n \nFeedback",
