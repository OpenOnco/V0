        "abstract": "Aggressive variant prostate cancer (AVPC) is a lethal subtype of prostate cancer characterized by its androgen independence, resistance to chemotherapy, and display of neuroendocrine features which can emerge either de novo or via transformation after a prior diagnosis of adenocarcinoma. The poor clinical outcomes in patients with AVPC are associated with its profound molecular heterogeneity. In this study, we analyzed 23 consecutive AVPC cases treated at a dedicated small-cell clinic (2017-2025) using clinicogenomic and transcriptomic profiling. Transformed AVPC exhibited significantly shorter overall survival times than de novo AVPC (11.8 vs 26.0 months, P < 0.001). Integrative genomic analyses identified residual androgen signaling in subsets of cases harboring neuroendocrine lineage programs, highlighting a decoupling of lineage identity and morphology. To facilitate mechanistic and pharmacologic studies, we established NCI-LYM-1, a patient-derived organoid/PDX from an AR-negative, ASCL1+/SYP+ lymph node metastasis, which faithfully recapitulates the donor tumors molecular and phenotypic features. Short- and long-read whole-genome sequencing combined with optical genome mapping identified biallelic inactivation of PTEN, TP53, RB1 and BRCA2 as potential drivers, demonstrating clonal concordance with circulating tumor DNA from the original patient donor. Pathway and perturbation analyses suggested that NCI-LYM-1 harbored a strong dependency on apoptotic pathways, which was confirmed by in vitro organoid testing with the BCL-2/BCL-xL inhibitor navitoclax (IC50: 0.27 {micro}M) and the MCL-1 inhibitor AZD-5991 (IC50: 0.060 {micro}M). Overall, NCI-LYM-1 recapitulates the clinical aggressiveness and heterogeneity of AVPC, providing a tractable platform to identify novel precision therapies.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundFluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy, including 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and capecitabine, is a cornerstone of adjuvant treatment in non-metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). While acute cardiotoxicity is recognized, the long-term impact on coronary artery health remains poorly understood. This study aimed to determine whether CRC survivors treated with fluoropyrimidines exhibit a higher burden of coronary artery disease (CAD) years after therapy completion.\n\nMethodsIn this cross-sectional, single-center study, CRC survivors five to seven years post-adjuvant 5-FU/capecitabine therapy (ChemT group) undergoing elective coronary angiography, were compared with age- and sex-matched cancer-free controls undergoing elective coronary angiography (n=45/group). Clinical, laboratory, echocardiographic, and invasive angiographic parameters were systematically evaluated. The primary endpoint was the presence and anatomical distribution of significant CAD.\n\nResultsDespite fewer anginal symptoms, ChemT patients had a significantly higher prevalence of CAD in the proximal left anterior descending artery (24% vs 2%, P=0.004) and proximal right coronary artery (13% vs 0%, P=0.026). Overall, 44% of ChemT patients required percutaneous coronary intervention versus 16% of controls (P=0.006), with a greater number of stents implanted in the ChemT group. Notably, the ChemT cohort also demonstrated elevated LDL cholesterol, hepatic transaminases, and abnormal hematologic indices, suggestive of long-term metabolic and vascular stress. Echocardiography revealed no significant impairment in ejection fraction but altered left ventricular geometry in the ChemT group compared to controls.\n\nConclusionsCRC survivors treated with fluoropyrimidine-based chemotherapy exhibit a significantly elevated burden of anatomically high-risk coronary artery disease, particularly in proximal segments with poor prognostic implications. These findings highlight a silent but clinically significant cardiovascular risk in long-term cancer survivorship and support the need for proactive cardiac surveillance strategies in this population.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=152 HEIGHT=200 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/25334733v2_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (31K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e00985org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@911e16org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@14e5facorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@6b4a30_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

        "abstract": "Introduction and ObjectivesMetabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD) affects about one-quarter of adults worldwide, and liver fibrosis is its strongest predictor of liver-related morbidity and mortality. Using combined in-silico screening and clinical validation, we aimed to identify circulating biomarkers associated with fibrosis progression. Fibulin-3 was identified, and its diagnostic performance was evaluated in biopsy-proven MASLD cohorts.\n\nMaterials and MethodsThe GSE125251 RNA-seq dataset was reanalyzed to compare liver transcriptomes from MASLD subjects with minimal (F0-F1) versus moderate to advanced fibrosis (F2/F3-F4). Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were filtered to retain plasma-secreted, protein-coding candidates. Top-ranked genes were evaluated in liver biopsies from a morbidly obese cohort (n = 65) stratified by fibrosis stage, and their plasma levels were measured via ELISA in an independent bariatric cohort (n = 225).\n\nResultsAmong 106 DEGs, 22 encoded plasma-circulating proteins. Six top candidates (EFEMP1, LTBP2, LUM, DPT, CHI3L1, CCL20) were prioritized. EFEMP1 (Fibulin-3) showed the strongest association with fibrosis, with significantly higher hepatic mRNA and protein expression in F2/F3-F4 versus F0-F1 (p < 0.005). Plasma Fibulin-3 levels correlated with fibrosis stage ({rho} = 0.40, p < 0.0001), increasing from 9.4 ng/mL in F0-F1 to 21.7 ng/mL in F2/F3-F4. Its diagnostic performance for F [&ge;] 2 (AUROC = 0.78) exceeded that of APRI, FIB-4, NFS, and HSI. A combined index including Fibulin-3, HSI, platelets, and GGT increased the AUROC to 0.87 (CI: 0.79-0.92).\n\nConclusionsPlasma Fibulin-3 is notably higher in individuals with advanced MASLD and represents a promising non-invasive biomarker for liver fibrosis stratification in metabolically unhealthy obese populations.",

These data can be obtained through manual (human) extraction or programmatic natural language processing (NLP) methods. We estimate that NLP only becomes economically competitive with manual extraction when there are ~6500 EHRs records. We have found that there is interest from clinicians and researchers in using NLP on projects with fewer records. We examine whether a large language model (LLM) can be used to reduce the cost of NLP to make it economically competitive for such projects, and study the feasibility of such framework for accuracy.\n\nMaterials and MethodsWe developed an NLP pipeline using an off-the-shelf open LLM to extract breast cancer ER, PR, and HER2 biomarker data. Pipeline development stopped when the prompts performances were competitive with manual extraction. The development time and extraction performance were compared to those for an existing rule-based (RB) NLP pipeline. The code for the extraction portion of the LLM pipeline is available at https://github.com/sehagler/llm_biomarker_extraction.\n\nResultsThe LLM pipeline produced performance competitive with manual data extraction with a hands-on development time that was ~38% that of the RB pipeline.\n\nDiscussionLLMs exhibit lower hands-on development costs compared to standard NLP techniques, but require significant and potentially costly computation resources.\n\nConclusionLLMs may potentially allow the economically competitive application of NLP to smaller projects if computation costs can be managed.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundImmune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs) have transformed the treatment landscape for advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), yet primary resistance remains common, with only [~]50% of patients responding to first-line chemo-immunotherapy and 20-30% to monotherapy. Existing biomarkers such as PD-L1 expression and Tumor Mutational Burden (TMB) demonstrate limited predictive accuracy, underscoring the need for more comprehensive, integrative approaches.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a prospective, multicenter study involving 439 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 ICI across first-line combo with chemotherapy and later-line monotherapy settings. A total of 443 pre-treatment tumor and blood-derived biomarkers--including genomic alterations, immune cell phenotypes, proteic markers, and routine laboratory tests--were profiled. Extensive biostatistics adjusted for PD-L1 expression were conducted. A rigorously benchmarked machine learning (ML) pipeline including 36 feature selection methods embedded into an optimism-correction framework was applied to identify predictors of primary resistance (PrR).\n\nResultsSingle biomarkers showed limited predictive utility, with PD-L1 (AUC 0.62, positive predictive value (PPV) 49.6%), TMB (AUC 0.55, PPV 43.1%), and key gene mutations (e.g., STK11, KEAP1) failing to achieve significance after multiple testing correction. A gradient boosting ML model integrating 18 selected features yielded a corrected AUC of 0.69 and a Positive Predictive Value (PPV) of 60% for PrR, outperforming standard biomarkers. In first-line patients, the model achieved a PPV of 51% and Negative Predictive Value (NPV) of 79% (baseline PrR rate: 29.9%); in subsequent-line patients, PPV reached 64% (PrR rate: 55.1%). Importantly, the signature also stratified Progression-Free Survival (PFS): high-risk patients had a median PFS of 3.9 vs. 14.6 months in low-risk patients (HR 0.307, p < 0.0001). Features from routine blood tests--such as serum chloride, albumin, CRP, and monocyte-to-lymphocyte ratio (MLR)--accounted for half of the final model and demonstrated independent associations with both PrR and PFS (e.g., chloride: OR 0.616, AUC 0.626; HR 0.685, C-index 0.61). SHAP-based individual-level model explainability revealed heterogeneous and nonlinear biomarker contributions, including cases where high CRP, low albumin, or elevated MLR overrode favorable PD-L1 or Treg profiles. A biomarker dashboard including interactive visualizations is available at https://compo.inria.fr/pioneer-website/.\n\nConclusionsMultimodal machine learning integration of clinical, genomic, immune, and laboratory data enables improved prediction of ICI resistance in NSCLC beyond current biomarkers. This approach not only captures the multifaceted nature of tumour-host interactions but also highlights the underrecognized predictive value of accessible blood-based markers, offering a path toward individualized immunotherapy decision-making.\n\nHighlightsO_LIWe conducted a prospective, multicenter biomarker study of 439 patients with advanced NSCLC treated with anti-PD-(L)1 therapies across first- and later-line settings, profiling a total of 443 clinical, routine laboratory parameters, tumor and blood-derived biomarkers prior to treatment initiation.\nC_LIO_LIA machine learning-derived 18-feature multimodal signature predicted primary resistance (PrR) to anti-PD-(L)1 therapy with higher accuracy than standard biomarkers (AUC 0.69, PPV 60%).

Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA)-based minimal residual disease (MRD) assays have shown promise to improve management and surveillance in several tumor types, but their clinical utility in HPV- HNSCC remains understudied.\n\nObjective: To evaluate the performance of a tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD assay (PredicineBEACON) in patients with newly diagnosed, locally advanced HNSCC (LA-HNSCC).\n\nDesign: Between 12/2020 and 3/2022 ctDNA was assessed before surgery, before the start of adjuvant treatment (MRD-E), within six weeks of completion of treatment (MRD-TC), and during surveillance (MRD-S). Patients were followed for at least 12 months after treatment completion. We used Kaplan-Meier survival analyses to compare recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS) between patients who were MRD positive those who were MRD negative during each time window. Multivariable Cox hazard regressions were used to assess the association between MRD status and outcomes while controlling for established risk factors.\n\nSetting: This was a prospective cohort study of patients treated at a large referral center specializing in treatment of HNSCC.\n\nParticipants: Forty patients with newly diagnosed, LA-HNSCC treated with surgery followed by risk-adjusted adjuvant treatment\n\nIntervention: Tumor-informed ctDNA-based MRD testing\n\nMain Outcomes and Measures: Recurrence-free survival (RFS) and overall survival (OS)\n\nResults: We processed 142 samples from 40 patients. The median age was 63, 27% were female, 87% were Caucasian, and 95% had HPV- disease. Fifty percent (20/40) of patients experienced recurrence. The pre-surgery ctDNA detection rate was 97% (35/36). MRD-TC positivity was associated with worse OS (HR= 7.15; 95% CI: 1.44-35.3) and RFS (HR= 5.39; 95% CI: 1.98-21.07). MRD-S positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR=8.2; 95% CI: 2.06-33.6). The median time from first MRD detection to clinical detection of recurrence was 5 months (range 0.2-21.6). In multivariable analyses, MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS (HR 13.8; 95% CI 2.92-65.7) and worse OS (HR 18.9; 95% CI 2.27-158).\n\nConclusions and Relevance: Tumor-informed ctDNA MRD positivity was associated with worse RFS and OS in patients with HNSCC. MRD testing could serve as a non-invasive, prognostic biomarker in HPV- HNSCC patients.\n\nKey PointsQuestion: Among patients with locally advanced HNSCC (LA-HNSCC) treated with curative-intent surgery, is minimal residual disease (MRD) detection using a tumor-informed ctDNA-based assay prognostic for recurrence free survival (RFS) or overall survival (OS)?\n\nFindings: In this prospective cohort study of 40 patients with LA-HNSCC, nearly all of whom had HPV-independent disease, MRD positivity during the first 6 weeks after completing treatment and during surveillance was associated with worse OS and RFS.\n\nMeaning: Tumor-informed ctDNA MRD detection after treatment completion could serve as a non-invasive, prognostic biomarker in HPV-independent HNSCC patients.\n\nSocial Media PostFindings by @FadenLab and colleagues show that detection of MRD using a tumor-informed ctDNA-based after treatment completion is associated with worse recurrence free survival and overall survival in HPV-independent HNSCC.",

        "abstract": "As malignant transformation arises from dysregulated cellular programming with characteristic morphological changes, we hypothesized that cancer cells exhibit a unique morphological signature detectable in microscopy images of cells in vitro and in situ across modalities. To test this, we developed CellSign, an AI-based framework to generate Cell Dynamics Fingerprints, which (a) reconstruct morphological progression, (b) remove physiological variation, and (c) support automated malignancy assessment. To arrive there, cell morphology is represented by embeddings from vision foundation models, and a process we term Healthy-Component Reduction is used to refine these by subtracting normal physiological variation, thereby exposing residual disease-specific cues. Embeddings from healthy and malignant cells are organized with manifold learning and summarized with kernel density estimation. We show that unambiguous malignant signatures exist and that our method is robust across diverse datasets spanning breast cancer, lung cancer, and leukemia, transferring reliably between populations of single-cell images and multi-cell patches.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=179 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/26343803v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (60K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1a26532org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@a1c9f2org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1d13a79org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1560af9_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

        "abstract": "A central challenge in the field of polygenic risk prediction has been measuring and controlling for confounding effects mediated through population stratification. Traditionally, such control has been attempted through the inclusion of the top principal components (PCs) of variation and the use of linear mixed models in genome-wide association studies (GWAS). Reductions in test-statistic inflation, commonly assessed using the genomic inflation factor ({lambda}) and the linkage disequilibrium score regression (LDSC) intercept, as well as the preservation of polygenic risk score (PRS) predictive performance in within-family settings, are often taken as evidence that such confounding has been adequately controlled.\n\nIn this study, we examine the relationship between the number of PCs included during GWAS/PRS model development and the observed attenuation in performance when moving from a population-level setting to a cohort composed of discordant sibling pairs (within-family attenuation). The design enables the detection of confounding attributable to the environment and genetic background effects correlated with population structure. Analyses were conducted in the self-described White subset of UK Biobank (UKB) for coronary artery disease, type 2 diabetes, breast cancer, and prostate cancer. Educational attainment was included as a comparison trait, as it is known to exhibit substantial within-family attenuation.\n\nWe find that increasing the number of included PCs does not consistently reduce within-family attenuation among the traits examined. Moreover, reductions in attenuation do not closely track decreases in{lambda} or the LDSC intercept, and the use of mixed model-based approaches provides little additional benefit for prediction or attenuation. These patterns persist even in settings where GWAS test-statistic inflation has been substantially reduced.\n\nOur results suggest that the confounding in PRS targeted by PC-adjustment and linear mixed models is either minimal in the self-described White subset of the UKB or persists in ways that are not adequately captured by current population structure adjustment methods. Taken together, our findings suggest limitations as to how much standard population structure adjustment methods, or reductions in test statistic inflation, are currently improving the causal validity of PRS built using the UK Biobank.",

While previous studies explored DRC in relation to environmental exposures and cancer risk, few measured DRC in patient-focused cohorts and were focused on one or two repair pathways only. We comprehensively profiled DRC for all the major repair pathways and DNA lesions in 100 lung cancer patients undergoing radiotherapy (RT) using advanced Fluorescence Multiplex based Host Cell Reactivation assays in blood cells before and after RT and investigated how DRC responded to RT and was influenced by clinical variables. Variation between individuals was significant in all pathways and smaller than variation within-person. DNA glycosylase activity decreased immediately following RT and subsequently returned to baseline in patients receiving high-intensity RT during the follow-up months. Lower DRC against oxidative lesions was found in cancer patients compared to healthy controls. These results highlight oxidative DNA damage repair as a sensitive marker of RT response and cancer burden upon profiling the DNA repair landscape.\n\nGraphical Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=113 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/26343971v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (26K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@e5488eorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fe7381org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@151313aorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1771302_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

        "abstract": "BackgroundCYFRA 21-1, a cytokeratin-19 fragment, is a validated serum biomarker for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). However, most studies rely on single time-point measurements, limiting its specificity in differentiating malignancy from benign pulmonary conditions. Inspired by the clinical utility of serial PSA measurements in prostate cancer, we investigated whether longitudinal trends in CYFRA 21-1 could enhance diagnostic and monitoring capabilities in patients with pulmonary nodules\n\nMethods and FindingsWe analyzed 132 patients with pulmonary nodules, including 41 with lung cancer and 91 with benign diagnoses. CYFRA 21-1 levels were measured serially using electrochemiluminescence assays. Longitudinal trends were assessed using linear mixed-effects models to estimate biomarker trajectories. Subgroup analyses examined differences between benign, untreated cancer, and post-treatment cancer groups, as well as within-patient changes in a subset of 16 cancer patients with both pre- and post-surgical measurements. Log-transformed data were used for the analysis. At baseline, CYFRA 21-1 levels were significantly higher in malignant versus benign nodules. Over time, CYFRA trajectories diverged: benign cases showed slight increases, whereas cancer patients exhibited greater biomarker volatility. In treated cancer patients, trend of CYFRA levels on the natural log scale decline from -0.00137 pre-surgery to - 0.00263 to post-surgery, and both cancer groups showed significantly higher absolute slopes than the benign group (p < 0.05). While pre- vs post-treatment slope differences did not reach significance (p = 0.211), the general pattern indicated that CYFRA 21-1 is a dynamic marker responsive to tumor presence and removal.\n\nConclusionsCYFRA 21-1 exhibits substantial within-patient variability over time, with trajectories that reflect disease state and treatment. These findings suggest that longitudinal monitoring of CYFRA 21-1--analogous to PSA velocity in prostate cancer-- may offer improved diagnostic and prognostic insight in the evaluation of pulmonary nodules. Further studies in larger cohorts are warranted to validate these findings and explore clinical implementation of CYFRA trajectory analysis.",

        "abstract": "Objective: Metastatic dissemination in lung cancer (LC) and other solid tumors is influenced not only by tumor-intrinsic biology and immune-inflammatory responses, but also by physical properties of vascular system through which circulating tumor cells (CTCs) migrate. Peripheral arterial disease (PAD), particularly when manifesting as aneurysmal dilation, is frequent among smokers and is associated with chronic vascular inflammation and altered hemodynamics. Approach and Results: We hypothesized that PAD-related vascular remodeling and rheological alterations may influence tumor metastatic capacity. Through a retrospective analysis of 976 patients diagnosed with both cancer and arteriopathy between 2018 and 2024, a cohort of 120 individuals was identified. Demographic, biochemical, and pathological variables were examined, and metastatic burden at diagnosis was compared with that of an unselected LC population from the same institution and with literature-reported data. We focused on non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) as biological model and developed a phenomenological biophysical framework linking inflammation-driven changes in blood viscosity to metastatic competence. A Monte Carlo simulation approach was used to estimate metastasis probability under control and PAD-like rheology. Despite marked male predominance and high smoking exposure, the study cohort exhibited an unexpectedly low metastatic burden: 13.3% of patients presenting metastatic disease at diagnosis and only 7.6% showing extrathoracic dissemination vs an expected rate of approximately 30%. Partition analysis identified arteriopathy as the strongest predictor associated with reduced metastatic dissemination. The rheological model indicated that once inflammation exceeds a critical threshold, increased blood viscosity and disturbed flow patterns may act as a mechanical filter impairing CTC extravasation. Monte Carlo simulations supported this threshold-dependent mechanism, showing an approximately 50% reduction in predicted metastatic rates in PAD-like conditions vs controls. Conclusion: Collectively, these findings suggest that chronic PAD may reshape the circulatory microenvironment, with NSCLC providing a mechanistically interpretable framework for a transition from metastasis-permissive to metastasis-restrictive rheological regimen.",

        "abstract": "Background Precision oncology relies heavily on genomic profiling and artificial intelligence to predict therapeutic response in breast cancer. However, in low-to-middle-income countries (LMICs), these expensive modalities are inaccessible; forcing clinicians to rely on qualitative TNM staging that often fails to capture individual tumour heterogeneity. There is a critical unmet need for frugal innovation tools that convert standard histopathological data into quantitative prognostic scores. This study proposes a novel deterministic scalar mathematical model to quantify tumour resistance and predict therapeutic efficacy without high-cost infrastructure. Methods We developed a theoretical framework that transforms qualitative pathological inputs (TNM stage, Grade, and Ki67 status) into quantitative scalar variables. The model is anchored on three derived parameters: (1) Relative Severity of Disease (RSD), a multiplier based on stage-specific survival decay; (2) a graded Tumour Proliferation Index (Ki67); and (3) the Tumour-Dependent Therapeutic Response Coefficient (TmdRxResCoef). Resistance (Res) was modelled as the product of mass (RSD) and velocity (Ki67score), while therapeutic responsiveness was defined as the inverse of resistance (1/Res). Results The model demonstrates a non-linear, inverse relationship between tumour burden and the potential for therapeutic gain. Crucially, the model exposed a \"biological equivalence\" between Stage I/High-Grade tumours (Resistance Score = 4.0) and Stage IV/Indolent tumours (Resistance Score = 3.8), challenging the dogma that anatomical stage is the sole driver of prognosis. We successfully quantified the \"Resistance Gap,\" demonstrating that a high-velocity early-stage tumour yields a TmdRxResCoef of <25%, mathematically defining a requirement for aggressive systemic therapy despite small anatomical size. Conversely, the model identified indolent metastatic phenotypes with stable resistance profiles suitable for de-escalated management. Conclusion This scalar model bridges the gap between basic histopathology and precision medicine. By providing a mathematically transparent, calculator-ready method for quantifying tumour resistance, it empowers clinicians in resource-limited settings to make evidence-based decisions on treatment escalation or de-escalation. This framework offers a rigorous, low-cost alternative to genomic profiling and provides a scalable, mathematically transparent scaffold for future AI integration in oncology.",

        "abstract": "While radiation is an effective oncologic therapy, killing cancer by inducing DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs), it lacks specificity for neoplastic cells. We have previously adapted the CRISPR-Cas9 gene-editing technology as a cancer-specific treatment modality targeting somatic mutations in pancreatic cancer (PC). However, its tumoricidal potential remains unclear, especially in comparison to therapeutic doses of radiation. Here, we demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs are significantly more cytotoxic in PCs than a comparable number of radiation-induced DSBs. We observed >90% tumor growth inhibition by targeting 9 sites with cancer-specific single-guide RNAs (sgRNAs). Through both bioinformatics and cytogenetics analyses, we found that CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs triggered ongoing chromosomal rearrangements, with 87% of structural variants being novel rather than directly produced from CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs, and chromosomal instability (CIN) peaking before cell death. By comparing the cytotoxicity of CRISPR-Cas9- to radiation-induced DSBs, we demonstrate that the number of DSBs required to achieve equitoxic effects was [~]3 times higher for radiation than CRISPR-Cas9. Finally, we show that PC cells that had survived CRISPR-Cas9 targeting retained susceptibility to subsequent CRISPR-Cas9-induced DSBs at different genomic sites with >87% growth inhibition. Together, our data support the therapeutic potential of CRISPR-Cas9 as an anti-cancer strategy.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundCachexia is defined by chronic loss of fat and muscle, is a frequent complication of pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC), and negatively impacts patient outcomes. Nutritional supplementation cannot fully reverse tissue wasting, and the mechanisms underlying this phenotype are unclear. This work aims to define the relative contributions of catabolism and anabolism to adipose wasting in PDAC-bearing mice. Human antigen R (HuR) is an RNA-binding protein recently shown to suppress adipogenesis. We hypothesize that fat wasting results from a loss of adipose anabolism driven by increased HuR activity in adipocytes of PDAC-bearing mice.\n\nMethodsAdult C57BL/6J mice received orthotopic PDAC cell (KrasG12D; p53R172H/+; Pdx1-cre) (PDAC) or PBS (sham) injections. Mice exhibiting moderate cachexia (9 days after injection) were fasted for 24h, or fasted 24h and refed 24h before euthanasia. A separate cohort of PDAC mice were treated with an established HuR inhibitor (KH-3, 100 mg/kg) and subjected to the fast/refeed paradigm. We analyzed body mass, gross fat pad mass, and adipose tissue mRNA expression. We quantified lipolytic rate as the normalized quantity of glycerol released from 3T3-L1 adipocytes in vitro, and gonadal fat pads (gWAT) ex vivo.\n\nResults3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with PDAC cell conditioned media (CM) had lower expression of lipolysis and lipogenesis genes than control cells, and did not display elevated lipolysis as measured by liberated glycerol. PDAC gWAT cultured ex vivo displayed decreased lipolysis compared to sham gWAT (-54.7%). PDAC and sham mice lost equivalent fat mass after a 24h fast, however, PDAC mice could not restore inguinal fat pads (iWAT) (-40.5%) or gWAT (-31.8%) mass after refeeding. RNAseq revealed 572 differentially expressed genes in gWAT from PDAC compared to sham mice. Downregulated genes (n=126) were associated with adipogenesis (adj p=0.05), and expression of adipogenesis master regulators Pparg and Cebpa were reduced in gWAT from PDAC mice. Immunohistochemistry revealed increased HuR staining in gWAT (+74.9%) and iWAT (+41.2%) from PDAC mice. Inhibiting HuR binding restored lipogenesis in refed animals with a concomitant increase in iWAT mass (+131.7%).\n\nConclusionsOur work highlights deficient adipose anabolism as a driver of reduced lipid content in 3T3-L1 adipocytes treated with PDAC conditioned media and PDAC mice. The small molecule KH-3, which disrupts HuR binding, restored adipose anabolism in PDAC mice. This highlights HuR as a potentially targetable regulatory node for adipose anabolism in cancer cachexia.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundA resemblance of pancreatic tumors to their native tissue architecture remains largely unexplored, while it may reveal novel insights into the healthy and diseased tissue.\n\nObjectiveThis study aims at generating a spatially resolved map of human pancreatic duct cell populations in the native tissue and in tumors, i.e. pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) and adenosquamous cancer of the pancreas (ASCP).\n\nDesignNew datasets were acquired with several spatial transcriptomics platforms and were integrated with public single-cell RNAseq datasets and validated by multiplex immunofluorescence. Cell lines and primary human cell cultures were genetically manipulated.\n\nResultsGroups of Keratin-5+ cells in larger ducts have a gene signature reminiscent of stem cells and (supra)basal cells from other tissues. At single cell resolution, this group comprises {Delta}Np63+ basal cells (BAS) and {Delta}Np63- supra-basally residing luminal-B cells (LUM-B). The latter express previously unreported MUC4 and MUC16. Additionally, we identified three other luminal cell populations in the ducts (LUM-A, -C, -D). In cancer, BAS and LUM-B signatures associate with basal-like (BL) PDAC, and correlate with lower survival. However, PDAC exhibits a random spatial pattern and fragmented native expression programs while ASCP preserve the identity of LUM-B and BAS in a spatially unmixed pattern. {Delta}Np63 drives cell plasticity to BAS, conserved from the native tissue to cancer.\n\nConclusionSpatially distinct duct cell populations are revealed, and the extent of preservation of the native cell identities in pancreatic cancer underpins distinct tumor identities. This warrants a separate consideration in research and therapy.\n\nWhat is already known on this topicWhile tumors in the pancreas can exhibit basal-like and squamous features resembling tumors of other tissues, their resemblance to the native duct cells, and possible subpopulations thereof, had not been studied in detail.\n\nWhat this study addsOne basal and four luminal spatially distinct cell populations exist in human pancreatic ducts. These are best conserved in ASCP while PDAC shows loss of the native cell identity program.\n\nHow this study might affect research, practice or policyOur study demonstrates fundamental differences between the tumor cells of the BL PDAC versus the rare ASCP, highlighting the necessity for a clear distinction between them in research and in tumor-specific treatments. Meanwhile, the research community should acknowledge the spatial and functional heterogeneity of human duct cells, including in their experimental models.",

        "abstract": "Background: Triple-negative breast cancer is an aggressive breast cancer subtype characterized by the absence of human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, estrogen and progesterone receptors, limiting targeted therapy options. Cisplatin, a chemotherapeutic agent, induces DNA damage and exhibits some efficacy against triple-negative breast cancer, but its effectiveness is often reduced by chemoresistance and systemic toxicity. A very promising strategy to augment cisplatin treatment can be based on combining it with the biologic Cetuximab, an epidermal growth factor receptor inhibitor, which boosts cisplatin efficacy by inducing ferroptosis. Results: To optimize this strategy in a biocompatible and precise manner, we developed a nanoplatform based on red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles for the combined delivery of Cetuximab and cisplatin, enabling immune evasion, and the possibility of autologous personalization and GMP-compliant production. Owing to their DNA-free lumen and lack of EGFR, RBC-EVs preserve cisplatin activity and prevent interference with cetuximab. This formulation enhances cisplatin's cytotoxicity by up to 50%, as shown in vitro and in patient-derived organoids. It effectively reduces chemoresistance by downregulating hypoxia-related genes and promoting ferroptosis, additionally, it improves cisplatin's cytotoxic effects while reducing hemotoxicity compared to the administration of free cisplatin. Conclusions: These findings highlight the potential of red blood cell-derived extracellular vesicles as a biocompatible delivery system enabling combined therapy and offering a promising strategy to overcome current limitations in TNBC treatment.",

Emerging evidence indicates that the p53-induced RNA-binding protein ZMAT3 acts as a key splicing regulator that contributes to p53-dependent tumor suppression in vitro and in vivo. However, the mechanism by which ZMAT3 functions within the p53 pathway remains largely unclear. Here, we discovered a function of ZMAT3 in inhibiting transcription of HKDC1, a hexokinase that regulates glucose metabolism and mitochondrial respiration. Quantitative proteomics revealed HKDC1 as the most significantly upregulated protein in ZMAT3-depleted colorectal cancer cells. ZMAT3 depletion resulted in increased mitochondrial respiration, which was rescued by simultaneous depletion of HKDC1, suggesting that HKDC1 is a critical downstream effector of ZMAT3. Unexpectedly, ZMAT3 did not bind to HKDC1 RNA or DNA; however, proteomic analysis of the ZMAT3 interactome identified its interaction with the oncogenic transcription factor JUN. ZMAT3 depletion enhanced JUN binding to the HKDC1 locus, leading to increased HKDC1 transcription that was rescued upon JUN depletion, suggesting that JUN activates HKDC1 transcription in ZMAT3-depleted cells. Collectively, these findings uncover a mechanism by which ZMAT3 regulates transcription through JUN and demonstrate that HKDC1 is a key component of the ZMAT3-regulated transcriptome in the context of mitochondrial respiration regulation.",

Here, we show that METTL3 is mislocalized to the cytoplasm in breast cancer tumors from patients, contributing to the oncogenic phenotype. Cytoplasmic METTL3 interacts with EXOC7, a key regulator of exocytosis, promoting its stabilization. Additionally, METTL3 regulates m6A-dependent alternative splicing of EXOC7. Silencing METTL3 impairs vesicle trafficking and the breast cancer secretome - effects that do not rely on its enzymatic activity but instead involve METTL3-mediated stabilization of EXOC7 and potentially other exocyst components. Furthermore, METTL3 knockdown impairs invadopodia formation, collagen matrix invasion, and focal adhesion morphology in vitro, while inhibition of METTL3 catalytic activity does not. Our findings uncover non-catalytic roles of METTL3 in regulating exocytosis and the cancer secretome.",

However, its broad adoption has been constrained by the lack of an open-source end-to-end workflow in a community-driven ecosystem. Here, we introduce openDVP, an experimental and computational framework for simplifying and democratizing DVP. OpenDVP integrates open-source software for image analysis, including MCMICRO, QuPath, and Napari, and uses the scverse data formats AnnData and SpatialData for multi-omics integration. It offers two workflows: a fast-track pipeline requiring no image analysis expertise and an artificial intelligence (AI)-powered pipeline with recent algorithms for image pre-processing, segmentation, and spatial analysis. We demonstrate openDVP's versatility in three archival tissue studies, profiling human placenta, early-stage lung cancer, and locally relapsed breast cancer. In each study, our framework provided insights into health and disease states by integrating spatial single-cell phenotypes with exploratory proteomic data. Finally, we introduce deep proteomic profiling of cellular neighborhoods as a scalable approach to accelerate spatial discovery proteomics across biological systems.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundTriple-negative breast cancer (TNBC) is an aggressive subtype of breast cancer with limited therapeutic options and poor prognosis. DNA methyltransferase 1 (DNMT1) maintains aberrant silencing of tumor suppressor genes, contributing to cancer progression. Our previous work demonstrated that Lantana camara leaf extract induces G0/G1 arrest and apoptosis, while inhibiting migration in MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells (Pal et al., 2024).\n\nPurposeThis study investigated the role of DNMT1 in mediating the anticancer effects of Lantana camara extract.\n\nStudy DesignAn in vitro experimental study was performed using MDA-MB-231 TNBC cells.\n\nMethodsCells were treated with the extract, and the expression of DNMT1 was analyzed at the mRNA and protein levels. Expression of tumor suppressor genes was assessed at mRNA level. Functional assays were conducted following DNMT1 overexpression to examine its impact on extract-induced effects. Expression of methyl-CpG binding domain protein 2 (MBD2), histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1), and histone deacetylase 2 (HDAC2) was evaluated at the mRNA level.\n\nResultsThe extract significantly downregulated DNMT1, resulting in the reactivation of multiple tumor suppressor genes. Overexpression of DNMT1 counteracted the extract-induced reduction in cell viability, reduced G0/G1 arrest, attenuated apoptosis, and enhanced migratory capacity, while suppressing the mRNA expression of tumor suppressor genes. Additionally, the extract downregulated the mRNA expression of MBD2, HDAC1, and HDAC2, suggesting broader modulation of epigenetic regulators.\n\nConclusionSuppression of DNMT1 is a central mechanism underlying the anticancer activity of Lantana camara extract. These findings highlight its potential as a natural epigenetic modulator and a promising therapeutic candidate for TNBC.",

Lantana camara has diverse medicinal properties, including anti-cancer potential; however, its role in breast cancer is not well-explored.\n\nAim of the studyThe study aims to elucidate the role of Lantana camara leaf extract in miR-181a-5p-mediated control of proliferation, survival, and migration of breast cancer cells.\n\nMaterial and methodsReal-time PCR was employed for RNA expression studies. Bioinformatic tools were used for identifying miR-181a-5p target mRNAs and seed regions in the 3 prime untranslated region of target mRNAs. miR-181a-5p was overexpressed in cells using transfection method. Flow cytometry was employed for cell cycle and apoptosis assays. Scratch assay was performed to study cell migration. The 3 prime untranslated region of CDKN3 was cloned, and site-directed mutagenesis was employed to mutate miR-181a-5p seed region. Western blot analysis was employed for a reporter assay.\n\nResultsL. camara leaf extract upregulated the expression of miR-181a-5p with concomitant decrease in mRNAs of BCL-2, MCL-1, and CDKN3 in breast cancer cells. Overexpression of miR-181a-5p induced cell death in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and cell death increased in the presence of leaf extract. miR-181a impeded migration in both cell lines in the presence of the extract. Reporter assay confirmed the interaction of miR-181a-5p with 3 prime untranslated region of the CDKN3 mRNA.\n\nConclusionOur study suggests that the extract may play an important role in regulating miR-181a-5p in MCF-7 and MDA-MB-231 cells, and may have important therapeutic potential for breast cancer therapy.",

Here, we identify a stress-responsive feedback loop between the E3 ligase TRIM28 and the demethylase ALKBH2. TRIM28 binds ALKBH2 and promotes its K48-linked polyubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, whereas ALKBH2 enhances TRIM28 transcription and protein levels, forming a feedback loop. Notably, alkylation stress induces a biphasic response: acute MMS exposure enhances TRIM28-ALKBH2 association and accelerates ALKBH2 degradation, whereas prolonged exposure promotes TRIM28 degradation, leading to ALKBH2 stabilization and transcriptional upregulation. Clinically, ALKBH2 is frequently elevated in lung adenocarcinoma and is associated with worse survival, whereas TRIM28 exhibits prognostic value specifically in chemotherapy-treated patients. Functionally, MMS-cisplatin co-treatment increased DNA damage and reduced clonogenic survival by counteracting ALKBH2-dependent alkylation tolerance, linking the TRIM28-ALKBH2 loop to chemoresistance in NSCLC.",

        "abstract": "As the third leading cause of cancer related deaths in the United States, pancreatic cancer (PaC) is a highly heterogenous malignancy that can be divided into a multitude of potential subtypes, with the main 4 consisting of aberrantly differentiated endocrine exocrine (ADEX), immunogenic, progenitor, and squamous. Each PaC subtype is characterized by their unique molecular pathways and therapeutic characteristics. Identifying PaC molecular subtypes is essential for downstream patient risk stratification and tailored treatment design. Conventional wet-lab approaches for PaC subtyping like microdissection, histopathological studies or molecular profiling are often laborious, costly and time-consuming. To address these concerns, we present MetaPaCS, a novel meta-learning framework to accurately identify PaC subtypes based on transcriptomics data only. Specifically, after preprocessing, the transcriptome-based feature vectors were classified by 10 base machine learning (ML) classifiers, whose prediction outputs were then combined with the initial preprocessed feature vectors to constitute a new set of ensemble feature vectors for a meta-learning model. Our meta-learning model could learn and leverage the diversity of different base classifiers to boost the prediction performance beyond any single ML model. Results based on 100 times ten-fold cross validation tests on benchmarking datasets demonstrated that MetaPaCS performed significantly better than existing state-of-the-art methods for PaC subtyping. In addition, our meta-learning model remarkably outperformed each individual base classifier, demonstrating that MetaPaCS could combine diverse results from multiple base classifiers to boost the ensemble performance. We believe that MetaPaCS is a promising tool for characterizing PaC subtypes and will have positive impacts on downstream risk stratification and personalized treatment design for PaC patients.",

However, most published OS data is limited to primary tumor samples, limiting insight into patient-specific resistance mechanisms. To address this, we characterized the genomic landscape of paired primary and metastatic tumor samples from dogs with spontaneous OS. Whole-genome and single-cell RNA sequencing reveal mutation and gene expression profiles that are predominantly organized by patient identity. Mutational burden and pathway alterations such as those involving PI3K, NOTCH, TP53, MAPK, RAS and epigenetic regulation differ between primary and metastatic samples. Variants present in tumor tissue are readily detectable in paired cfDNA samples, demonstrating utility of this assay for identifying tumor-specific alterations associated with treatment resistance disease. Analysis of bulk RNA-seq data to estimate cell-type composition shows greater immune cell representation in metastases, underscoring the importance of immune signaling pathways in OS. These findings exemplify the presence of patient-specific alterations in genomic architecture over the course of tumor progression, linking CNV amplification, pathway reprogramming, and immune evasion in metastatic OS.",

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a pivotal role in regulating numerous biological functions within CSCs. Through a gain-of-function miRNA screening, we identified miRNAs that regulate the ALDEFLUOR-positive CSC population in colon cancer, with miR-4745 emerging as a promising inhibitor. Overexpression of miR-4745 reduced CSC self-renewal, diminished chemoresistance, and prevented CSC enrichment after chemotherapy in patient-derived CRC models. Mechanistically, miR-4745 directly targets the 3UTR of kinesin-light chain 2 (KLC2) mRNA, a member of the kinesin superfamily associated with poor clinical outcomes across various cancers. siRNA-mediated KLC2 downregulation reduced ALDH-positive CSCs and suppressed sphere formation, while KLC2 overexpression promoted CSC traits. Additionally, we observed an inverse correlation between KLC2 and miR-4745 mRNA levels in different colon cancer cell culture settings. Notably, KLC2 mRNA levels increased with local CRC progression and were correlated with poor overall survival in a cohort of over 1 000 stage I to IV colorectal cancer patients. Our study uncovers a novel miR-4745-KLC2 axis that regulates CSC properties and chemoresistance in CRC, offering a promising strategy to prevent relapse and improve clinical outcomes for patients.",

Understanding the molecular effectors of hypoxia is essential to identify new therapeutic targets. Here, we investigated tropomyosin 3 (TPM3), an actin-binding protein that regulates filament stability. TPM3 is significantly upregulated in breast cancer, including in TNBC, where elevated levels correlate with poor overall survival. Using validated hypoxia signatures and TNBC cell models, we show that TPM3 is induced in physiologically relevant hypoxic conditions in a HIF-1-dependent manner. Both mRNA and protein levels of TPM3 increased in response to hypoxia, and TPM3 colocalised with F-actin, supporting cytoskeletal organisation. Functional assays demonstrated that depletion or inhibition of TPM3 impaired cell morphology, motility, and invasion in hypoxic TNBC cells, while not affecting viability. Notably, TPM3 inhibition synergised with Paclitaxel and Doxorubicin, enhancing therapeutic efficacy. In addition, TPM3 was incorporated into extracellular vesicles (EVs), with hypoxia increasing EV-mediated transfer of TPM3 to normoxic cells and promoting their motility. These findings establish TPM3 as a hypoxia-inducible, HIF-1-regulated effector of cytoskeletal dynamics and intercellular communication, underscoring its potential as a therapeutic target to limit TNBC aggressiveness and improve treatment outcomes.",

        "abstract": "The risk for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) arising from metabolic dysfunction- associated steatotic liver disease (MASLD)-related cirrhosis exceeds the risk for cancer developing in the kidney, heart, or lung as a consequence of end-stage disease in those organs. Both experimental and clinical studies support the existence of circulating biomarkers whose elevated expression is associated with, and supports the diagnosis of, HCC. We posit the existence of oncogenic HCC biomarkers under regulation by tumor-suppressive microRNAs (miRs), and that reduced tumor-suppressive miR expression leads to increased oncogenic biomarker expression. By interrogating the MASLD-HCC miR interactome and miRs known to regulate HCC biomarkers, we identified hsa-miR-577, hsa-miR-9500, hsa-miR-101-3p, miR-206, hsa- miR-219a-1-3p, and hsa-miR-613 as tumor-suppressive miRs whose expression is reduced across multiple cancers. Their target genes, osteopontin, Golgi protein-73, and Dickkopf-related protein 1, exhibit increased expression in HCC and display oncogenic activity. Collectively, dysregulated expression of these miRs and their downstream gene products may contribute to progression along the MASLD continuum toward HCC.\n\nHighlightsWe identified tumor suppressive miRs, hsa-miR-577, hsa-miR-9500, hsa-miR-101-3p, miR-206, hsa-miR-219a-1-3p, and hsa-miR-613 with potentially reduced expression levels in HCC. Their gene products, osteopontin, Golgi protein-73, and Dickkopf-related protein 1, exhibit oncogenic properties and increased expression levels in HCC. These miR-gene product interactions may drive the MASLD continuum to HCC. Mechanistic insights should illuminate therapies. Identification of therapeutics that interrupt these interactions may represent a therapeutic pillar for patients with MASLD.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=159 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/698028v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1892140org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e61677org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@cd0488org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1e48d8a_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigureC_FLOATNO MASLD-related HCC.\n\nThe intersection set between the MASLD-HCC miR interactome and the set of miRs regulating biomarkers diagnostic for HCC was interrogated and tumor suppressive miRs regulating HCC biomarkers with oncogenic activity were identified. Increased risk for HCC in patients with MASLD and MASLD-cirrhosis may arise from interactions between these dysregulated miRs and their downstream gene products.\n\nC_FIG PrologueMetabolic Dysfunction-Associated Liver Disease (MASLD), the leading cause of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in Sweden, is now taking epidemic proportions in South Asia. In India, there is a relatively high prevalence of pre-diabetes, diabetes and insulin resistance; body mass indices > 35 are being observed. Each of these and/or their combinations represent risk factors for MASLD. Nevertheless, both patients and providers are largely oblivious to this disease, both from a lack of general awareness and the asymptomatic nature of MASLD, at least early within its continuum. Diagnosis is often made late, and by exclusion, when presentation may include fatigue, drowsiness, mild encephalopathy (MASLD-pituitary feedback loop), prominent hepatomegaly and asciites, and with liver-specific test demonstrating stiffness, scarring and even HCC. Societal awareness and effective management of this disease are urgent needs. A strategy akin to the 4 pillars for treatment of type 2 diabetes and chronic kidney disease (CKD) needs to be implemented for treatment of patients with MASLD.\n\n\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=30 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/698028v1_ufig2.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 2\">\nView larger version (11K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@89a77org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d50c15org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@10c6964org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@1db2cfa_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG O_FLOATNOFigureC_FLOATNO Four-pillar Strategy for MASLD.\n\nA strategy akin to the one in place for treatment of type 2 diabetes and CKD needs to be implemented for treatment of patients with MASLD.

        "abstract": "Palomena prasina (L.) (Hemiptera: Pentatomidae), the green shield bug (GSB), is an important hazelnut pest in Southern Europe. Currently, its control focuses on insecticide spraying during the crop season. We hypothesised that, as for other pentatomid species, adjacent habitats strongly influence the population build-up in spring and, therefore, lead to edge effects in crop fields during the production season. This could allow for precision-targeted pest management strategies. This study examined the spatio-temporal dynamics of the GSB in spring and summer over two years. We investigated the plant preferences of GSBs in spring and the existence of edge effects on their distribution and on fruit damage in hazelnut orchards in summer. We also examined the relative contribution of adjacent habitats to GSB abundance in crops.\n\nOur results show that, following their emergence from overwintering in spring, GSB adults, and later on their offspring, are primarily found on wild host plants in natural habitats, particularly on Crataegus monogyna Jacquin, and Cornus sanguinea L.. In early summer, the older nymphs of the second generation colonise the hazelnut orchards, with populations and damage proportion displaying edge effects. We were unable to identify an adjacent habitat variable that significantly explains the abundance of GSB in the orchards, although both forest habitats and hazelnut orchards have an effect on GSB abundance. Based on these findings, we propose various IPM strategies for controlling P. prasina.",

In vivo systems provide physiological relevance but are poorly suited for mechanistic studies and screening, whereas conventional in vitro assays lack the organ-specific extracellular matrix (ECM) context that critically influences invasive behavior. To address this gap, an ex vivo method is established that balances biological relevance with scalability, affordability, and ease of use.\n\nMild detergent decellularization of mouse organs followed by vibratome slicing generates optically transparent lung, liver, and intestine scaffolds that preserve native ECM architecture, mechanics, and composition. These organ-derived matrices are readily integrated into standard microfluidic channels and analyzed using conventional fluorescence microscopy, enabling quantitative assessment of cancer cell invasion without specialized infrastructure.\n\nBenchmarking with breast cancer cell lines of well-defined invasive capacity confirms the robustness and biological relevance of the platform. Non-invasive MCF7 cells fail to infiltrate any scaffold, whereas highly invasive MDA-MB-231 cells display organ-specific invasion, preferentially penetrating lung and liver ECM while showing virtually no invasion of intestinal scaffolds, consistent with clinically observed metastatic tropism. Quantitative invasion rates closely match values reported in vivo by intravital microscopy.\n\nOverall, this ex vivo system provides an accessible and scalable platform to study ECM-driven determinants of metastatic invasion while reducing reliance on animal models.",

Although scFv humanization reduces this risk, residual foreign residues within the variable domains remain. To overcome this limitation, we used in vitro phage display to generate fully human B7-H3-specific scFvs for CAR design. In pancreatic cancer, neuroblastoma, and glioblastoma xenograft models, CAR T cells incorporating the lead human binder Y111 were well tolerated and demonstrated superior antitumor activity compared with 376.96- and MGA271-based CARs.

However, the high spatial resolution in ST leads to cellular heterogeneity within spots, requiring computational deconvolution to infer cellular compositions. While scRNA-seq serves as a key reference for deconvolution, the impact of reference composition on its accuracy is still unclear. In this study, we systematically evaluate the impact of reference selection for cellular deconvolution and give helpful guide-lines to researchers to address this task.\n\nMethodsWe systematically evaluate the impact of single-cell reference selection for global and cell type-specific deconvolution performances in primary and metastatic breast cancer ST datasets. Focusing on state-of-the-art deconvolution tools Cell2location and Robust Cell Type Decomposition (RCTD), we assess the influence of varying reference sizes, cell-type distributions, reference-ST pairings, as well as the usage of large breast cancer and cross-cancer atlases.\n\nResultsOur findings demonstrate that even small reference datasets can yield accurate deconvolution results, with RCTD and Cell2location exhibiting similar performances across cell-types. Heterogeneous entities, such as myeloids, presented greater challenges for accurate deconvolution compared to more distinct ones, such as epithelial cells. Spatial domains associated with prominent cell types like cancer and stromal cells were detected, although their contributions were systematically under- or over-estimated Additionally, we found that perfect reference-ST matching enhances deconvolution accuracy compared to the usage of cross-patient references. Finally, large breast cancer single-cell atlases com-posed of a diverse set of patients were also able to provide reliable deconvolution results.\n\nConclusionThis study provides important insights into optimizing reference selection for ST deconvolution, highlighting the strengths and limitations of current computational tools in addressing cellular heterogeneity within spatial transcriptomics datasets.",

Phage display was used to isolate single-chain variable fragment (scFv) clones that recognize specifically RalA (C1-A, G5-A), RalB (F6-B), or both paralogs (A12-AB). Using lentiviral transduction, these intrabodies were stably expressed as GFP fusions in murine breast cancer 4T1 cells. The anti-RalA clones C1-A and A12-AB demonstrated clear colocalization with RalA, confirming their binding activity inside the cell. We further confirmed their activity in cells by analyzing Ral-dependent pathways. All intrabodies targeting RalA (C1-A, G5-A, A12-AB) but not the one specific to RalB inhibited mitochondrial fission, a known RalA function. All clones, except the pan-Ral one, altered the endo-lysosome pathway by decreasing lysosome number. Furthermore, the RalA-specific C1-A clone reduced lysosomes size, and uniquely and strongly reduced extracellular vesicle secretion, highlighting its distinct inhibitory potential. In an orthotopic Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (TNBC) mouse model, The C1-A RalA specific clone significantly but weakly reduced primary tumor growth, but exerted a powerful anti-metastatic effect, dramatically reducing lung metastases, with a complete abolition of metastases observed in 2/5 mice.\n\nIn summary, these potent, isoform-specific Ral intrabodies act as effective intracellular inhibitors, successfully modulating RalA-specific functions in cells and offering a promising therapeutic strategy for significantly suppressing tumor growth and metastasis in vivo.",

Collagen type I is the main component of the ECM and its abundance in tumors is frequently associated with poor prognosis. In vitro studies suggest that a high collagen density promotes tumor invasion and modulates immune responses. However, recent in vivo findings have questioned the pro-tumorigenic role of collagen type I.\n\nIn this study, we investigate the role of collagen for pancreatic tumor growth and immune cell infiltration using conditional collagen type I knockout mice and transgenic collagenase-resistant mice. Preventing collagen type I significantly reduces intratumoral collagen content and tumor growth. This reduction is accompanied increased infiltration of natural killer (NK) cells, a higher CD8/CD4 T cell ratio, and decreased numbers of monocytic myeloid-derived suppressor cells (MDSCs).\n\nConversely, collagenase-resistant mice develop collagen-dense tumors and display enhanced tumor growth. These mice also generally exhibit opposing effects on cell infiltration, including a lower CD8/CD4 ratio and increased MDSC abundance.\n\nThese findings are further supported by analyses of publicly available human cancer datasets, which confirm an association between collagen type I levels and immune cell infiltration.\n\nOverall, our results demonstrate a pronounced pro-tumorigenic role of collagen type I in pancreatic cancer, which is associated with modulation of the tumor immune microenvironment. This study highlights the importance of extracellular matrix components as key regulators of tumor progression and anti-tumor immunity.",

Despite favorable responses to anti-estrogen therapy, the dissemination of cancer cells and resistance to therapies are significant risks for patients with ILC. Late recurrences are prevalent in ILC, suggesting that disseminated tumor cell dormancy may be a mechanism preceding their late overt growth into metastatic lesions. Herein, we investigated the relationship between anti-estrogen resistance and dormancy through multidimensional in vitro models. The bioengineered platforms recapitulated the morphological characteristics of ILC and highlighted its distinction from invasive ductal carcinoma. Inducing a dormant phenotype revealed epigenetic changes and enhanced chemical and mechanical sensing of anti-estrogen-resistant ILC cells to the substrate surface, with p27Kip1 signaling playing a central role. We propose this platform as a high-throughput method to investigate the propensity of dormancy and its manifestation via a simplified and expedited approach.",

Brazilin, a homoisoflavonoid with reported antitumoral properties, does not fully meet pharmaceutical criteria, and chemical modification of natural compounds is often required to enhance bioactivity and efficacy. Here, we evaluated the pro-apoptotic activity of Brazilin and its semi-synthesized methoxylated (OMe)3 and acetylated (OAc)3 derivatives in triple-negative MDA-MB-231 and luminal A MCF7 breast cancer cell lines.\n\nWe assessed cell viability, proliferation, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial integrity, and analyzed apoptotic features using confocal microscopy, western blotting, and RT-qPCR. In addition, RNA sequencing was performed to characterize transcriptomic changes in MDA-MB-231 cells following treatment with unmodified Brazilin or its derivatives. Brazilin and Brazilin-(OAc)3 significantly reduced cell viability and proliferation in MDA-MB-231 cells, whereas MCF7 cells exhibited increased viability and growth in response to Brazilin-(OMe)3. In MDA-MB-231 cells, treatment with Brazilin and Brazilin-(OAc)3 induced apoptosis-associated features, including chromatin condensation, {gamma}H2AX accumulation, and PARP cleavage. These effects were accompanied by a modest increase in mitochondrial oxidative stress and loss of mitochondrial membrane potential. Notably, no cytotoxic or apoptotic features were detected in non-tumorigenic MCF10A cells.\n\nTranscriptomic analysis revealed that Brazilin treatment upregulated genes associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress, including ATF3, in MDA-MB-231 cells. Collectively, our results indicate that Brazilin and its acetylated derivative selectively induce mitochondrial stress and cell death in triple-negative breast cancer cells, potentially involving ER stress pathways.",

        "abstract": "Tumor resistance to radiotherapy continues to be a significant problem in improving cancer patient outcomes. To overcome radioresistance, drugs that sensitize cancer cells to ionizing radiation have been tested. In theory, radiosensitizers should increase irradiated tumor kill and improve patient outcomes. In practice, the clinical utility of such drugs is curtailed by radiosensitization of peri-tumoral normal tissues causing toxicities. To address these issues, we developed an activatable cell penetrating peptide-drug conjugate to deliver a small molecule radiosensitizer with spatial precision to tumors. The activatable cell penetrating peptide (ACPP) scaffold cloaks a cell penetrating peptide-drug conjugate until it is unmasked within tumors through matrix metalloproteinase cleavage. Using antibody-drug conjugate linker chemistry, we attached the potent ataxia-telangiectasia mutated (ATM) kinase inhibitor AZD0156 to ACPP and created ACPP-AZD0156. In immune-competent murine cancer models, tumor-targeted ACPP-AZD0156 in combination with ionizing radiation stimulated tumor immune infiltration by CD8+ T cells and increased tumor control when compared to non-targeted ATM inhibitor. Mechanistically, ACPP-AZD0156 radiosensitized tumor control was dependent on the adaptive arm of the immune system. Finally, the combination of radiotherapy and ACPP-AZD0156 potentiated immune checkpoint inhibitors that resulted in durable tumor control. The therapeutic synergies of ACPP targeted ATM inhibitor to radiosensitize and stimulate anti-tumor immune responses provides a rationale for developing tumor-targeted radiosensitizer drug conjugates that restrict radiosensitization to cancer cells that then engages anti-tumor immune responses to improve cancer patient outcomes.",

A Random Forest classifier yielded excellent training performance (AUC: 1.0000; accuracy: 98%) and good generalization on an independent test set (AUC: 0.8438; accuracy: 75%). Consistent feature importance across folds supports biological relevance over overfitting. The framework mitigates class imbalance, high dimensionality, and distribution shifts--key hurdles in biomarker discovery. These reproducible miRNAs hold promise as non-invasive diagnostic tools, though external validation underscores generalization challenges across cohorts.",

Yet, their role in the treatment-naive breast tumor microenvironment (TME) remains elusive. Here, we show that the breast TME shapes eosinophils into a less active state characterized by loss of Ly6C. While bone marrow and circulating eosinophils are Ly6C, this population progressively transitions into a Ly6C- state marked by reduced cytotoxicity and interferon (IFN) responsiveness during tumor progression. Further investigation of Ly6C uncovered previously unappreciated granularity of eosinophil differentiation in vitro, recapitulating the Ly6C to Ly6C- transition and associated functional loss observed in vivo. IFN stimulation partially restored the Ly6C phenotype ex vivo. Importantly, in ICB-treated tumors, Ly6C+ eosinophils positively correlated with increasing levels of IFNs, suggesting an additional mechanism by which IFNs contribute to effective ICB responses. We propose Ly6C as a key marker of eosinophil differentiation and activation, with the TME shaping eosinophils into a less cytotoxic Ly6C- state.",

The model yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae encodes six eIF3 subunits whereas mammals encode thirteen subunits. The basidiomycete fungus and opportunistic fungal pathogen, Cryptococcus neoformans, encodes a mammalian complement of eIF3 subunits. In this report, we investigated the contribution of the non-essential eIF3 subunit genes to cryptococcal stress tolerance. We found that mutants in the four nonessential subunits, eIF3d, eIF3e, eIF3k and eIF3l all exhibit sensitivity to mitochondrial perturbation, and that mutants in eIF3d and eIF3e exhibit opposite susceptibilities to the antifungal drug fluconazole and the hypoxia mimetic cobalt chloride. Loss of eIF3d resulted in reduced eIF2 phosphorylation in response to stress, but the mutant was still able to repress translation to the same extent as the wild type and was defective in induction of integrated stress response regulon. Despite producing higher levels of urease and melanin, the eIF3d deletion mutant was avirulent in Galleria mellonella larvae. Together our data demonstrates the importance of C. neoformans eIF3 in stress adaptation and pathogenesis.\n\nImportanceCryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that causes cryptococcal meningoencephalitis in immunocompromised individuals leading to [~]120,000 deaths worldwide annually. When C. neoformans is exposed to host-relevant stressors, such as oxidative stress and thermal stress, it reprograms the translating pool of mRNAs to favor stress adaptation. Eukaryotic translation initiation factor 3 is a multi-subunit complex with roles in stress-responsive translation across eukaryotes yet is unexplored in C. neoformans. We found that C. neoformans encodes orthologues of all thirteen mammalian eIF3 subunits. Mutational analysis of non-essential subunits implicated eIF3 in responses to mitochondrial stress and antifungal susceptibility in C. neoformans, and demonstrates a role for eIF3d in the induction of the integrated stress response as well as in Cryptococcal pathogenesis. Further work will investigate the specific mRNAs that are regulated by eIF3 in response to host-relevant stressors in C. neoformans.",

        "abstract": "Tumor-derived lactate is increasingly recognized as an immunosuppressive metabolite within the tumor microenvironment (TME), with emerging evidence highlighting its role beyond metabolism to include epigenetic and immune regulatory functions. While prior studies have primarily focused on individual immune checkpoints, most prominently PD-L1, it remains unclear whether lactate broadly coordinates the expression of multiple immune regulatory pathways across distinct tumor types, particularly in the context of chronic exposure mimicking glycolytic tumors. Here, we investigated the relationship between lactate-producing metabolism and immune checkpoint gene expression in four human cancer cell lines representing breast and lung cancer: MCF7 (estrogen receptor-positive breast), MDA-MB-231 (triple-negative breast), A549 (non-small cell lung), and H82 (small cell lung). By manipulating glucose availability and exposure duration to model acute (6 h) versus chronic (48 h) lactate production, and by pharmacologically inhibiting lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) with oxamate, we quantified extracellular lactate accumulation and assessed transcriptional responses of a panel of immune checkpoints (PD-L1, CD80, CD73, LGALS9, VISTA, PVR, CD47, FGL1, STING) and lactate-associated genes (MCT1, MCT4, LDHA, HCAR1) via qPCR. Chronic high-glucose conditions produced robust, LDH-dependent lactate accumulation and were associated with coordinated, lineage-specific remodeling of multiple checkpoint transcripts, whereas acute exposure induced minimal changes. MDA-MB-231 and A549 cells displayed striking but distinct checkpoint patterns under chronic lactate-producing conditions: MDA-MB-231 cells showed strong co-induction of PD-L1 and CD80, while A549 cells exhibited dominant CD80 induction with modest PD-L1 upregulation. H82 cells upregulated PD-L1 alongside CD73, LGALS9, CD47, and CD80, whereas MCF7 cells demonstrated more modest yet coordinated increases across several checkpoints. Chronic glucose exposure resulted in sustained, LDH-dependent lactate accumulation and coordinated induction of multiple immune checkpoint genes, with distinct lineage-specific patterns, e.g., robust PD-L1/CD80 upregulation in MDA-MB-231 versus CD80 dominance in A549. Unsupervised clustering and principal component analysis revealed that duration of glucose exposure, rather than acute glucose availability, was the primary axis of variation and that MCT4 and HCAR1 clustered with strongly induced checkpoints, consistent with a transcriptional program linking lactate export and sensing to immune regulation.\n\nThese findings support a model in which lactate acts as an upstream regulator of a broader immune escape program, potentially via mechanisms like lactylation and HCAR1 signaling. This work highlights the limitations of single-checkpoint blockade strategies in solid tumors and underscores the potential of targeting lactate metabolism to enhance immunotherapy efficacy in breast and lung cancers.",

        "abstract": "Abstract textBRCA1/2-mutated breast cancers exhibit homologous recombination deficiency (HRD), making them initially sensitive to poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors. However, 40-70% of patients develop resistance, necessitating combination strategies and predictive biomarkers. We first investigated approaches to overcome PARP resistance and then explored spatial microRNA (miRNA) profiling as a prognostic tool. Using the K14-Cre Brca1f/fTrp53f/f model with tumors that acquired PARP resistance, we evaluated PARP inhibitor combinations with either PI3K inhibition or Poly(I:C) in vivo. Both combinations improved antitumor activity compared to PARP inhibition alone. Next, to predict resistance we applied a sensitive assay that quantifies and spatially profiles miRNA expression in situ onto FFPE sections from tumors treated for 10 days using nanoliter well arrays with functionalized hydrogel posts. We developed a spatial miRNA analysis framework integrating latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) and principal component analysis (PCA) to develop \"topics\" that stratify early tumors as either PARP inhibitor-sensitive or - resistant and distinguish their treatment regimens. We also incorporated immune architecture using Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM) maps that revealed co-localization of immune infiltration and miRNA topics. This integrative approach highlights how miRNA-based spatial analysis can predict PARP inhibitor resistance and provide a promising biomarker to inform therapeutic strategies for BRCA1/2-related breast cancers.",

Yet, mechanistic knowledge of how endogenous ligands gate UPS decisions remains rudimentary. Here, we define control of UPS access to Tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase (TDO2), which converts the essential amino acid tryptophan (Trp) to N-formylkynurenine. When Trp concentrations are limiting, TDO2 is degraded to avert tryptophanemia. Using CRISPRi screening and biochemistry, we identify a CK2-FBXW11 kinase-E3 ligase cascade that generates and recognizes tandem TDO2 phosphodegrons when not protected by Trp. Trp binding to an exosite safeguards TDO2 from phosphorylation-dependent ubiquitylation. Effects of Trp analogs on CK2-FBXW11-dependent ubiquitylation indicated that the indole, amino, and carboxylate groups are necessary for substrate shielding. Cryo-EM reveals how these moieties order a region proximal to the phosphodegrons; without Trp, this segment is flexible, enabling phosphorylation-coupled ubiquitylation. Overall, our data uncovered an endogenous small molecule allosterically stabilizing its own metabolizing enzyme through protection from a phosphorylation-ubiquitylation cascade.",

        "abstract": "Postoperative pain remains a major clinical challenge, as inadequate management can delay functional recovery, prolong hospitalization, and increase the risk of chronic pain development. Opioid analgesics, while considered the gold standard for treating severe acute postoperative pain, are limited by adverse effects such as respiratory depression, dependence, and opioid-induced hyperalgesia, the latter being a key driver of persistent postoperative pain. Lapatinib, originally developed as an anticancer therapy, has recently shown analgesic potential in both preclinical and clinical studies. Importantly, unlike opioids, lapatinib does not appear to activate central reward pathways, thereby minimizing the risk of dependence. Although its efficacy has been investigated in several chronic pain models, its role in acute postoperative pain and the associated inflammatory response has not been explored. In this study, we demonstrated that lapatinib exerts anti-inflammatory effects in vitro by suppressing proinflammatory mediators (TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, COX-2, MMP, chemokines, mPGES-1 and PGE2) in lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-stimulated RAW 264.7 cells. In a mouse model of postoperative pain, preoperative administration of lapatinib attenuated both mechanical allodynia and thermal hyperalgesia. These behavioral effects were accompanied by decreased proinflammatory mediator expression (TNF, IL-1{beta}, IL-6, COX-2, and mPGES-1) and increased IL-10 levels in the injured paw tissue. Our findings highlight lapatinib as a promising candidate for repurposing as a novel analgesic for postoperative pain. Its targeted mechanism of action and lower potential for adverse effects compared with opioids support further investigation into its clinical utility in pain management.\n\nSignificant StatementWe found that lapatinib, a cancer drug with no risk of dependence, reduces inflammation and alleviates pain in a mouse model of postoperative pain. These findings suggest lapatinib could be repurposed as a safer, non-opioid therapy for surgical pain management.\n\nGraphic Abstract\n\nO_FIG O_LINKSMALLFIG WIDTH=200 HEIGHT=118 SRC=\"FIGDIR/small/698212v1_ufig1.gif\" ALT=\"Figure 1\">\nView larger version (29K):\norg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@d62c5corg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@fa84ddorg.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@128e143org.highwire.dtl.DTLVardef@dd1720_HPS_FORMAT_FIGEXP  M_FIG C_FIG",

        "abstract": "BackgroundBreast cancer risk is shaped by the vast heterogeneity of mammary epithelial cells, comprising basal, luminal progenitor, and mature luminal populations. While transcriptional variation among these lineages has been extensively studied, protein-level features - particularly in high-risk women - remain underexplored, limiting insight into early cellular and molecular determinants of susceptibility. Moreover, little is known about how clinical covariates influence clonogenic capacity, proteomic states, and epithelial proportions, complicating the design of properly controlled human studies of early breast cancer risk.\n\nResultsWe combined low-input proteomics with functional clonogenic assays to profile mammary epithelial cell subpopulations from a cohort of 21 breast tissues encompassing different germline mutation backgrounds, parity status and age. We quantified over 5,555 proteins and observed marked inter-donor variation in epithelial composition, proteomic programs, and colony-forming capacity. Multivariable modeling revealed that clinical covariates - including age, parity, and germline mutation status - modulate both global proteomic architecture and lineage-specific pathway activity. Parity was associated with reduced basal cell abundance, altered luminal progenitor and mature luminal proteomes, and changes in clonogenicity. Pathway analyses identified both conserved and lineage-restricted responses to shared risk factors. Projection of clonogenic signatures onto METABRIC and TCGA tumors further linked functional programs to tumor subtypes and clinical outcomes.\n\nConclusionsThis study provides the most comprehensive proteomic atlas of cell-type resolved diversity in the high-risk breast to date. By defining how clinical covariates remodel epithelial composition and molecular state, it clarifies key sources of biological variability that challenge controlled study design and offers a resource for improving mechanistic insight, risk assessment, and prevention strategies.",

Subsequent cell-type classification enabled quantitative cell-type analyses, co-localisation neighbourhood assessments, and cell-type-specific protein signature discoveries that distinguish between early and late/non-recurring patient samples.\n\nResultsThis study identifies a stem cell protein profile that drives tumour relapse. A deep neural network (DNN) model, based on a stem cell protein signature composed of BAX, MLKL, FLIP, GLUT1, and CDX2, provided accurate prognosis for stage III CRC patients in both discovery and validation cohorts and in an independent validation cohort. Nodal count-based metric further increased prognosis accuracy. Our study also revealed distinct spatial arrangements of immune, endothelial, and stem cells that were linked to early tumour recurrence.\n\nConclusionOur findings propose a clinically promising prognostic tool based on a five-protein stem cell signature.

Here, we examine the extent to which solution-phase structure and architecture can be retained after native, soft-landing electrospray ion beam deposition (ESIBD) by interrogating several membrane-protein complexes of diverse folds and oligomeric states by cryoEM. The overall protein architectures with secondary structure motifs can be observed after gas-phase transfer, soft landing, and embedding in amorphous ice. Notably, we determined the structure of the ammonium transporter AmtB at sub-3 [A] resolution. It is nearly identical to the structure of the plunge-frozen control and even shows an extended C-terminal segment of AmtB, a dynamic region absent in the solution-phase structure. Our analysis shows that detergent adducts preserve membrane protein structure in vacuum by minimising destabilization of solvent-exposed regions and stabilization through additional polar contacts in vacuo. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations support these results, suggesting that a monolayer shell of surfactant adducts avoids destabilization driven by unshielded polar residues and disruption of hydrogen bond networks. Overall, our findings provide a structural framework for integrating native MS with cryo-EM showing that gas-phase transfer and surfactant stabilisation preserves key architectural features and high-resolution structure of membrane proteins.",

        "abstract": "Background and aimsThe optimal eating window for time-restricted eating (TRE) remains unclear. We investigated the effects of 8-hour TRE combined with usual care (UC, a Mediterranean diet-based education program), versus UC alone over 12 weeks on hepatic fat fraction, liver health markers, and fecal microbiota in adults with overweight or obesity.\n\nMethodsIn this multicenter randomized trial, participants (50% women) were assigned to UC (n=49), early TRE (n=49), late TRE (n=52), or self-selected TRE (n=47). Hepatic fat fraction was assessed by MRI; liver markers included elastography-based parameters, liver enzymes, and circulating biomarkers. Fecal microbiota was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene sequencing.\n\nResultsHepatic fat fraction decreased significantly within the three TRE groups (all P[&le;]0.02), but no between-group differences were observed when comparing early TRE (mean difference [MD]: -0.4%; P=0.95), late TRE (MD: -1.5%; P=0.15), and self-selected TRE groups (MD: -0.7%; P=0.77) with the UC group, or among the TRE groups themselves (all P[&ge;]0.41). Similarly, no between-group differences were found in liver health markers and fecal microbiota. Participants with metabolic dysfunction-associated steatotic liver disease at baseline as well as those achieving [&ge;]5% weight loss had greater reductions in hepatic fat fraction than those who did not (MD: -2.7 and -2.6%; respectively, both P<0.001). A higher proportion of participants in the TRE groups achieved [&ge;]5% weight loss compared with UC (41-44% vs 16%; P=0.001).\n\nConclusionThese findings suggest that the timing of the eating window in TRE may not impact liver fat or microbiota composition beyond the effects of weight loss, though the study was not powered for secondary outcomes.\n\nThe study was registered on ClinicalTrials.gov (identifier: NCT05310721)",

        "abstract": "BackgroundThe prevalence of malnutrition risk among oncology patients across a wide range of cancer types in the United States (US) has rarely been investigated. The objective of this study was to characterize malnutrition risk by demographic and cancer characteristics, and to identify potential risk factors for malnutrition risk in diverse cancer patient populations.\n\nMethodsA cross-sectional analysis was conducted using Electronic Medical Record data from 2,894 adult patients living with cancer who underwent malnutrition screening at nine outpatient cancer clinics at the Huntsman Cancer Institute, with a catchment area that includes Utah, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, and Wyoming. Data were collected from January 2021 to April 2024. Malnutrition risk was evaluated using two validated malnutrition screening tools: the Malnutrition Screening Tool (MST) and NUTRISCORE. T-tests and Chi square tests of independence were used to assess differences in sociodemographic, geographic, and cancer characteristics between those with and without malnutrition risk. Logistic regression was implemented to identify potential risk factors for malnutrition risk in an outpatient cancer patient population.\n\nResultsMalnutrition risk prevalence for all cancers combined was 23% according to MST and 12% according to NUTRISCORE. Advanced cancer stage and current or previous smoking status were significant risk factors for malnutrition risk regardless of malnutrition screening tool. Head and neck, gastrointestinal, lung cancers, and malignant cancers with an unclear primary site had the highest prevalence of malnutrition risk.\n\nConclusionsOncology outpatient clinics in the US Mountain West have a malnutrition risk prevalence of up to 23%. Patients with advanced cancer stages, smokers or former smokers, and those diagnosed with head and neck, gastrointestinal, and lung cancers may be at increased risk for malnutrition. Implementation of validated malnutrition screening tools is warranted across outpatient oncology institutions.",

        "abstract": "IntroductionDonor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA) is a standard-of-care biomarker in kidney transplantation, reported as percentage of total cfDNA or copies/mL. We hypothesized that combining both metrics into a continuous composite score would reduce false classifications thus improving the accuracy of rejection diagnosis.\n\nMethodsWe analyzed 443 dd-cfDNA measurements in 383 individual patients from five independent kidney transplant cohorts with both percentage and copies/mL. A random discovery set of 31 biopsy-proven rejection and 29 non-rejection cases was used to derive a continuous composite score (CM-Score) integrating dd-cfDNA (%) and copies/mL. Fixed thresholds from the discovery group were validated in 75 rejections and 279 non-rejections for diagnostic performance and compared to twelve published cohorts.\n\nResultsThe CM-Score outperformed dd-cfDNA percentage and cp/mL alone. At the predefined threshold (at 25% prevalence), the CM-Score retained a high NPV of 91% (89-93%), while significantly improving PPV to 80% (78-83%; P<0.002), compared to the published values (weighted average NPV: 88%; 89-90%; PPV: 51% 50-53%, N=6,861). In addition, a decision curve analysis yielded a significantly higher net benefit for the CM-Score (P<0.003; prevalence 10-25% at threshold 15-50%). This superior diagnostic performance of the CM-Score can broaden the applicability of dd-cfDNA to real-world transplantation populations.\n\nConclusionsThe CM-Score is a robust and clinically meaningful tool that improves diagnostic accuracy for both ruling-out and ruling-in rejection using dd-cfDNA and establishes itself as a superior stand-alone metric with clear potential to improve decision-making in kidney transplantation.\n\nLay Summary (Clinical)Kidney transplant failure remains a major concern, and early detection of injury is crucial to prevent long-term damage. A less invasive alternative to a biopsy is a simple blood test that measures tiny fragments of DNA from the transplanted kidney, called donor-derived cell-free DNA (dd-cfDNA). These results can be reported either as a percentage of total DNA or as the number of DNA copies in the blood. We examined whether combining both measurements could improve the detection of rejection. Using data from five transplant cohorts, we developed a combined measure (CM-score) and validated it in 279 samples without rejection and 75 with rejection. At an assumed rejection rate of 25%, it correctly identified rejection with a positive predictive value of 80% and ruled it out with a negative predictive value of 91%. Overall, the CM-score may help doctors diagnose rejection more accurately and make timely treatment decisions.",

Given the growing burden of treatment-related side effects such as cognitive impairment, this study aims to investigate whether prehabilitation can improve brain health and cognitive function in patients with colorectal cancer receiving adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy.\n\nMethodsThis randomised control trial will recruit eighty-six patients with stage II and III colorectal cancer, who will receive adjuvant and neoadjuvant chemotherapy (fluorouracil, capecitabine, or oxaliplatin) and will be randomised between prehabilitation and standard care groups. The prehabilitation group will be provided an individualised, home-based exercise programme before and during chemotherapy, multivitamin supplementation, telephone check-ins, and activity devices. The standard care group will be provided with information about physical activity and nutrition at the start of the intervention. Habitual physical activity will be tracked in all patients. Assessments will be conducted at baseline, 72 hours before the first chemotherapy administration, and 72-96 hours after the final treatment. Outcome measures will include cardiopulmonary fitness, neurotrophic biomarkers, electroencephalographic activity, cognitive function tests, and a cognitive-related quality of life assessment. This protocol was approved by the East Midlands - Derby Research Ethics Committee, United Kingdom (approval number: 25/EM/0250) on December 17th, 2025.

        "abstract": "Stromal tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (sTILs) are promising biomarkers for predicting therapeutic outcomes in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC), with higher sTIL levels correlating with improved chemotherapy response and survival outcomes. Currently, sTILs are manually evaluated by pathologists, which is prone to inter-reader variability. In this study, we have developed an AI-driven TIL segmentation pipeline to process entire diagnostic hematoxylin-and-eosin-stained whole slide images for reproducible scoring (global TILseg scoring) and reliable prognostication. This pipeline was optimized and tested using two independent TNBC patient cohorts (n = 57 in the discovery cohort, n = 43 in the validation cohort) with clinical outcomes and follow-up data. The global scores generated by TILseg showed moderate to high concordance with expert scoring (Spearman R = 0.84-0.89) and improved patient stratification (p-value = 0.0191) as compared to manual scoring (p-value = 0.0663). Additionally, we investigate how the spatial localization of sTILs (spatial TILseg) impact survival outcomes by identifying TILs in selected stromal subsets (0.02-2 mm from the epithelial clusters). Our findings have shown that TILs up to 50 {micro}m from epithelial regions prove to be most prognostic in predicting recurrence-free survival post-neoadjuvant chemotherapy with higher statistical significance than both manual and global TILseg scoring. Further, spatial TILseg scoring was more significantly associated with pathological complete response status in both patient cohorts. In summary, we present an AI-based digital tool for robust sTIL scoring and spatial mapping to enhance its potential as both a diagnostic and prognostic biomarker, particularly in TNBC patients.\n\nSIGNIFICANCEAn automated and spatially resolved AI tool for sTILs scoring enhances patient risk stratification based on both response to treatment and recurrence-free survival, establishing its relevance as an independent prognostic marker.",

        "abstract": "Background Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) is currently linked to increased breast cancer (BC) diagnoses. While this appears paradox to an estimated 15-year development period of hormone receptor-positive BC, the discrepancy can be explained if HRT has two effects. Methods We modelled cohorts of 100,000 women using two parameters: HRT caused accelerated tumour growth and increased incidence. A reference cohort used age-specific incidence, a 15-year growth period, and life expectancy. Treatment cohorts with faster growth and higher incidence were simulated over 30 years. Study endpoints were cumulative and annual BC incidence. Using data from the Womens Health Initiative (WHI), we estimated the factors that reproduce the WHI long-term outcomes. Results The data indicate that HRT accelerates the growth of previously undetected BC, causing them to appear as seemingly new cases. The timing and duration of HRT determine when this rise occurs. After roughly 15 years of tumour development, an inherent HRT-related risk becomes apparent and overlaps with the expected baseline risk of aging women. The WHI results were reproduced with a growth acceleration factor of 1.4 and an initiation risk factor of 2, consistent with an approximate 10% drop in BC incidence in the United States around 2002 following reduced HRT use. Conclusion Estimates of about one million additional HRT-associated BCs may largely reflect accelerated growth of pre-existing BCs. Risk-adapted screening strategies could diagnosis newly initiated tumours early. By communicating these short- and long-term effects of HRT on cancer risk patients and physicians could make an informed decision on the risks and benefits of HRT-use.",

Novel evidence-based tools for estimating one key risk, violent reoffending, have been developed in recent years. We aimed to externally validate one new tool, FoVOx, in forensic psychiatric patients sentenced to treatment, and to develop an updated model (FoVOx2), incorporating additional clinical predictors.\n\nMethodsUsing Swedish national registers, we conducted a temporal external validation of FoVOx by examining 767 patients discharged between 2014 and 2023. For the FoVOx2 cohort, 906 patients discharged between 2008 and 2023 were followed up, and additional predictors tested. The outcome was violent reconviction within 12 or 24 months. Model performance was evaluated using Harrells C-index, time-dependent AUCs, calibration, and classification metrics at predefined thresholds.\n\nResultsIn temporal validation, FoVOx showed moderate discrimination (AUCs 0.69 and 0.71; C-index = 0.69) and acceptable overall accuracy (Brier <0.11). Calibration was generally good, with mild overestimation at the highest predicted risks (>20%) at 12 months and slight underprediction at 24 months. The updated FoVOx2 model newly incorporated clozapine treatment and additional diagnostic categories. It was associated with improved performance (AUCs 0.77; optimism-corrected C-index = 0.72; Brier 0.06 and 0.09) and achieved good calibration (intercept {approx} 0; slopes 1.03 and 1.05).\n\nConclusionsUpdating risk assessment tools with additional clinical factors can lead to incremental improvement in model performance.

Higher serum levels of the calcium-binding proteins S100A8/A9, particularly of S100A9, have emerged as a clinically and biologically significant factor in aggressive breast cancers that are associated with poorer prognosis, tumor progression, and resistance to therapy. However, its contribution in IBC specifically remains undefined. Here, we investigated whether serum levels of S100A8/A9 predict outcomes in patients with IBC.\n\nMethodsSerum S100A8/A9 levels were measured in a cohort of 304 IBC patients using ELISA assay. S100A8/A9 levels were categorized by their third quartile value (S100A8/A9-low [&le;] 3rd quartile; S100A8/A9-high > 3rd quartile). Overall survival (OS) and breast cancer-specific survival (BCSS) were analyzed with Kaplan-Meier curves, log-rank tests, and Cox proportional hazard regression models. The cumulative incidence of any metastases and the cumulative incidence of brain metastases were analyzed using Aalen-Johansen method, Gray test, and Fine-Gray models.\n\nResultsThe median follow-up time was 64 months. Forty-six percent of patients had estrogen receptor (ER)-negative tumors, 61.3% were stage III-IV, 77% high grade, 16.8% received adjuvant chemotherapy and 53.6% received adjuvant radiation. On univariate analysis, S100A8/A9 levels, disease stage, ER status, PR status, HER2 status, adjuvant chemotherapy, and adjuvant radiation therapy were significantly associated with OS and BCSS. Patients with high S100A8/A9 serum levels had poor OS (P=0.01) and BCSS (P=0.007) and had a higher risk of developing brain metastasis (P=0.01) but not other metastasis. On multivariate analysis, high S100A8/A9 serum levels were independently associated with reduced OS (hazard ratio [HR]=1.7, 95% CI 1.1 to 2.6, P=0.01), reduced BCSS (HR=1.8, 95% CI 1.2 to 2.8, P=0.006), and increased cumulative incidence of developing brain metastasis (subdistribution hazard ratio (sHR)=1.8, 95% CI 1.1 to 3.0, P=0.03).\n\nConclusionsIn patients with IBC, high serum levels of S100A8/A9 are an independent prognostic factor for brain metastasis and poor clinical outcomes. These findings support the potential of S100A8/A9 as predictive biomarker for identifying increased risk of brain metastasis and unfavorable prognosis in patients with IBC.",

        "abstract": "Pediatric solid high-risk malignancies mostly lack established molecular biomarkers for early detection, minimal residual disease assessment, or treatment monitoring. Challenges include small patient numbers, limited sample volumes, low tumor mutational burden, and few recurrent alterations. Within the prospective multicenter pediatric precision oncology program INFORM, we collected liquid biopsies from 130 pediatric patients and optimized cfDNA isolation and analysis. Whole-genome, whole-exome, and targeted panel sequencing were performed using liquid biopsy-adapted protocols. Integrating tissue-derived molecular profiles and orthogonal validation revealed that low-coverage whole-genome sequencing reliably detects circulating tumor DNA. An in silico ctDNA estimation score, combining fragment length and genome segment alterations, improved sensitivity and specificity to 95%, enabling plasma-based tumor detection in 93% of patients. Whole-exome and panel sequencing effectively identified clinically relevant, potentially druggable molecular targets; however, their utility varied substantially across different tumor entities, underscoring the need for entity-specific considerations in the interpretation and application of these methodologies. In-depth analyses demonstrated liquid biopsys potential to track tumor evolution, identifying common tumor ancestors and refining patient stratification. This study advances liquid biopsy methodologies in pediatric oncology and provides a rationale for the molecular alteration-informed selection and implementation of these complementary approaches within molecular tumor boards, with the aim of optimizing clinical management strategies for high-risk pediatric cancer patients.\n\nSignificanceSystematic liquid biopsy analyses within the pediatric precision oncology INFORM registry enabled a real-world, multicenter comparison of sequencing approaches across high-risk malignancies. By optimizing preanalytical and bioinformatic tools for pediatric settings, we improved plasma-based cancer detection, molecular tumor characterization, and identification of targetable alterations--laying the groundwork for integration into personalized medicine programs and clinical trials.",

Breast, prostate and lung cancer can all lead to poor skeletal outcomes, but patients particularly at risk are those with a diagnosis of multiple myeloma (1). Despite response to tumour targeting treatments, patients experience debilitating bone pain and fractures, affecting quality of life (2, 3). Currently, myeloma patients who are eligible, are offered treatment with induction chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell transplant (ASCT). Most eligible patients also receive bisphosphonates, to reduce skeletal morbidity, but this treatment is not optimal, or even conducive for bone recovery. Therefore, we wanted to assess whether current induction chemotherapy regimens have the capacity to reset the bone marrow microenvironment (BMME).\n\nThis prospective observational cohort study will recruit newly diagnosed myeloma patients from Sheffield Teaching Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust. Ethical approval has been granted to undergo two recruitment periods; cohort 1 (20 participants, forming a pilot study) and cohort 2 (up to 100 participants with a streamlined follow-up design).\n\nMacro-architectural skeletal bone disease will be assessed by whole-body low-dose CT (WBLDCT) scans, in which osteolytic lesions will be monitored longitudinally. Micro-architecture will be assessed by micro-CT scanning bone marrow trephine samples, and analysing changes in trabecular bone. Bone integrity will be assessed using computational models of both whole body skeletal and micro trephine images. Fasting serum samples will be collected to assess changes in bone turnover markers. This will be supported by histomorphometry and immunohistochemistry analysis of trephine sections. All samples / imaging will be performed at baseline and follow-up. Monitoring of quality of life (validated questionnaires) and occurrence of skeletal related events (SREs) will also take place. The observational period will end one year post ASCT. Data collected from this study, will provide an invaluable opportunity to comprehensively assess myeloma-induced bone disease and broaden our understanding of the disease course. It may also prove a valuable resource to guide the design of interventional clinical studies exploring novel bone-targeted therapies, including bone anabolic therapeutics, moving forward.",

        "abstract": "BACKGROUNDEarly detection of colorectal cancer (CRC) is essential for reducing disease-related mortality; however, the invasiveness and resource intensity of colonoscopy limit its widespread use in population screening. Although several non-invasive screening modalities are available, their sensitivity remains suboptimal, particularly for advanced precancerous lesions (APL). Stool-derived host RNA biomarkers represent a promising approach to improve screening performance. However, numerous technical challenges are associated with extracting and quantifying this RNA, including an abundance of PCR inhibitors, a high microbial background, and varying levels of RNA degradation.\n\nMETHODSWe developed an extraction method for the isolation of host RNA from stool with improved sensitivity of detection and better diagnostic performance than the conventional phenol-chloroform-based extraction. ECB-Extract (Enrichment Capture By hybridization), uses hybridization capture of RNA under denaturing conditions by adding locked nucleic acid bases to the probes. The improved hybridization characteristics allow us to directly isolate host RNA from stool lysate.\n\nRESULTSECB-Extract significantly improved PCR inhibitor removal, enabling scale-up of stool input and resulting in increased diagnostic sensitivity. We evaluated ECB-Extract against a conventional phenol-chloroform-based extraction method using the same panel of biomarkers in a pilot clinical cohort (N = 73). Using ECB-Extract, the sensitivity for detecting CRC and Advanced Precancerous Lesions (APL) was 96% and 50%, respectively, compared with 56% and 21% for the phenol-chloroform comparator at 96% specificity. In a larger cohort of 359 samples, ECB-Extract combined with a panel of the eight CRC-associated mRNA biomarkers achieved sensitivities of 95.7% for CRC and 51.2% for APL at a specificity greater than 90%.\n\nCONCLUSIONThese results demonstrate that ECB-Extract substantially improves stool host RNA extraction performance and, consequently, enhances diagnostic sensitivity for CRC and APL.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundA recent retrospective clinical study reported that COVID-19 mRNA vaccination administered around initiation of immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy may be associated with improved overall survival (OS) in metastatic melanoma and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Whether this association is limited to vaccination during ICI initiation or extends across a broader ICI treatment period remains unclear.\n\nMethodsWe conducted a single-centre retrospective cohort analysis of patients treated with palliative-intent ICI therapy at a UK tertiary cancer centre between October 2014 and December 2025. Demographics, COVID-19 vaccination status, timing, vaccine platform, ICI therapy and tumour type were extracted from electronic health records. Two COVID-19 vaccination exposure definitions were assessed: an initial exposure window (vaccination within 100 days of first ICI cycle) and an extended exposure window (vaccination between 100 days before the first ICI cycle and 100 days after the final ICI cycle). OS was assessed using Kaplan-Meier methods and Cox proportional hazards models, with hazard ratios estimated relative to unvaccinated patients.\n\nResultsAmong 2109 patients treated with palliative-intent ICI therapy, 515 (24.4%) received at least one COVID-19 vaccine dose. Using the initial exposure window, COVID-19 mRNA vaccination was not associated with a significant difference in OS in the overall cohort or within tumour-specific subgroups. In contrast, under the extended exposure window, mRNA COVID-19 vaccination was associated with longer OS in the all-tumours cohort (HR 0.58; 95% CI 0.46-0.75; p<0.0001), including melanoma (HR 0.35; 95% CI 0.18-0.69; p=0.002) and kidney cancer (HR 0.47; 95% CI 0.28-0.79; p=0.004), but not in NSCLC. In an era-restricted analysis limited to patients receiving ICI therapy from 2020 onwards, the association in the all-tumours cohort persisted (HR 0.76; 95% CI 0.59-0.98; p=0.04) with no statistically significant associations within tumour-specific subgroups.\n\nConclusionsCOVID-19 mRNA vaccination was associated with longer OS only when vaccination exposure was defined across an extended ICI treatment period and not when restricted to vaccination near ICI initiation. Prospective studies are required to determine whether mRNA COVID-19 vaccination during ICI therapy confers a true biological benefit and to define tumour-specific effects.",

        "abstract": "Selection of systemic therapy for breast cancer remains largely empirical, particularly for chemotherapy, due to the lack of robust biomarkers that predict treatment response at the individual patient level. We developed Oncology CoPilot, a real-world, transcriptomics-guided machine learning (ML) decision-support model designed to integrate heterogeneous tumor gene expression data and treatment response annotations to support treatment response stratification across therapeutic classes. Oncology CoPilot was trained on a pan-cancer cohort comprising 11,414 patients across 15 cancer types and 150 systemic drug regimens derived from publicly available and published datasets. Retrospective external validation was performed using five independent breast cancer cohorts comprising 503 patients, spanning multiple molecular subtypes, transcriptomic platforms, and six commonly used treatment settings, including chemotherapy, endocrine therapy, and targeted therapy. Across the external validation cohort, the model demonstrated an overall accuracy of 72.8%, with balanced sensitivity (71.5%) and specificity (73.4%), and an ROC-AUC of 0.783. Regimen-specific analyses demonstrated stable performance for chemotherapy-based regimens (accuracy 70.1%-79.1%), highlighting the potential of transcriptomics-guided modeling to inform treatment response stratification in clinical settings where therapy selection is often empirical. For endocrine therapy, the model achieved 95.0% accuracy for tamoxifen, suggesting that transcriptomic features may capture biologically relevant estrogen-responsive and resistance-associated programs beyond receptor status alone, although this result is exploratory and based on a small sample size. In contrast, HER2-targeted therapies showed lower and more variable predictive performance, with accuracies of 66.0% for trastuzumab monotherapy and 61.9% for anthracycline-taxane chemotherapy combined with trastuzumab, likely reflecting smaller cohort sizes and the biological heterogeneity characteristic of HER2-positive disease. Overall, these findings demonstrate the feasibility of leveraging real-world transcriptomic data and machine learning to achieve generalizable treatment response stratification across diverse cohorts, platforms, and therapeutic classes, supporting the potential role of transcriptomics-guided models as complementary decision-support tools in oncology.",

        "abstract": "BackgroundEarly and accurate prediction of pathological complete response (pCR) is essential for personalizing neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NACT) in invasive breast cancer. However, most high-performing predictive models rely on costly, multi-modal data that are not routinely available in standard clinical practice.\n\nPurposeTo develop and validate Breast Cancer Biological Multi-modal Information Transfer for Response Prediction Model (BC-BioMIXER), a biologically informed predictive model that transfers multi-omics-derived knowledge to routine clinical data, enabling accurate prediction of pathological complete response prior to neoadjuvant chemotherapy initiation.\n\nMaterial and MethodsBC-BioMIXER was developed in a multi-modality cohort of 648 patients with invasive breast cancer (T2-4, any N, M0) incorporating transcriptomic, proteomic, MRI, and clinical data. The model was externally validated in three independent cohorts (total N = 830), including one multi-modality cohort, one clinical trial cohort, and one contemporary real-world cohort. All patients received NACT followed by surgery. The framework employs a teacher-student knowledge-transfer paradigm in which a multi-omics teacher model learns biologically integrated representations that are subsequently transferred to a student model using only routine clinical data. Predictive performance for pCR was benchmarked against a multi-modality reference model and evaluated across cohorts, receptor-defined subgroups (HER2 and hormone receptor [HR]), and treatment groups (NACT with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors [ICI]). Prognostic value was assessed using distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS). The potential to inform immunotherapy decision-making was explored by comparing DRFS between NACT + ICI and NACT-alone groups within model-predicted pCR and non-pCR subgroups.\n\nResultsBC-BioMIXER achieved pCR prediction performance comparable to the multi-modality benchmark (AUC 0.82 vs. 0.85; p = 0.271) and demonstrated consistent discrimination across all validation cohorts (AUCs 0.82, 0.81, and 0.80; all p < 0.001). Patients predicted to achieve pCR experienced significantly improved 3-year DRFS (HR = 0.36; 95% CI, 0.20-0.67; p < 0.001). In patients treated with NACT + ICI, BC-BioMIXER showed numerically superior pCR prediction compared with PD-L1 expression alone (AUC 0.84 vs. 0.72; p = 0.08). Notably, within the model-predicted non-pCR subgroup, patients receiving NACT + ICI had significantly inferior DRFS compared with those receiving NACT alone (HR = 2.70; p = 0.032), whereas no significant difference was observed in the predicted pCR subgroup.\n\nConclusionBC-BioMIXER translates multi-omics-derived biological knowledge into a robust, routine-data-based predictive tool for breast cancer NACT. Its consistent validation across evolving clinical settings and its potential to inform personalized immunotherapy strategies highlight a step toward scalable and accessible precision oncology.\n\nHighlightsO_LIBrings multi-omics power to routine clinical practice: Through cross-modality knowledge transfer, BC-BioMIXER leverages transcriptomic and proteomic data during training to enable highly accurate pCR prediction using only standard MRI and clinical variables (AUC 0.82 vs. 0.85 for full multi-modality benchmark, p=0.271).\nC_LIO_LIConsistently strong and generalizable performance: Validated in three independent cohorts (total N=830), the model maintained robust pCR discrimination (AUC 0.80-0.82, all p<0.001) across receptor subtypes (HR/HER2) and treatment regimens, including with or without immune checkpoint inhibitors.\nC_LIO_LIGuides personalized immunotherapy de-escalation: In HER2-negative patients predicted as non-pCR, adding ICI to neoadjuvant chemotherapy was associated with significantly worse distant recurrence-free survival (HR 2.70, p=0.032) compared to chemotherapy alone. This effect was not seen in the predicted pCR group, suggesting the model may help identify patients unlikely to benefit from additional immunotherapy.\nC_LI",

This exploratory, phase II study investigated the feasibility and efficacy of a four-cycle perioperative regimen combining serplulimab with a taxane (paclitaxel or nab-paclitaxel) and carboplatin in patients with resectable stage II-IIIA sq-NSCLC.\n\nMethodsThis investigator-initiated, single-arm, phase II exploratory trial (NCT05775796) enrolled patients with histologically confirmed, resectable clinical stage II-IIIA squamous NSCLC. Patients received 2-3 cycles of neoadjuvant serplulimab plus taxane-carboplatin, followed by curative-intent surgery and 1-2 cycles of adjuvant treatment. The primary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR). Secondary endpoints included pathological complete response (pCR), R0 resection rate, overall response rate (ORR), safety, event-free survival (EFS), and overall survival (OS).\n\nResultsA total of 30 patients without actionable driver mutations were enrolled and 29 underwent surgery. The median age was 65 years, and most were male smokers (n=28, 93.33%). An R0 resection was achieved in 28 patients (93.33%), and the MPR and pCR rates were 76.67% and 50.00%, respectively. Based on radiological assessments during the neoadjuvant phase, the ORR was 73.33% (95% CI: 54.11-87.72). Grade 3 and more treatment-related adverse events were predominantly hematologic and were generally manageable. Long-term EFS and OS data are not yet mature. Additionally, exploratory minimal residual disease analysis using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in 27 patients showed a strong correlation between ctDNA clearance and pCR (p=0.004), suggesting ctDNA as a promising biomarker for immunochemotherapy response.\n\nConclusionsA four-cycle perioperative regimen of serplulimab combined with taxane-carboplatin demonstrated promising MPR and pCR rates with an acceptable safety profile in resectable sq-NSCLC patients. Long-term follow-up and future phase III trials are warranted to confirm survival benefits.",

Targeted lipidomics revealed a signature of five sphingomyelins (SMs) were significantly decreased in CRC patients in CCCC and UACC CRC series. Circulating SMs are degraded primarily by S-SMase and serum S-SMase activity was significantly higher in UACC cases as compared to controls. Serum S-SMase activity was also measured in two series of adenoma patients to determine if S-SMase may serve as a biomarker for development of colorectal neoplasia. While S-SMase activity was significantly higher in adenoma patients compared to controls in the mostly white UACC series, S-SMase activity in samples from the Chicago Black series (CCCC) were indistinguishable from each other and significantly higher than UACC controls. Conclusions Together, these studies suggest the potential for S-SMase activity to serve as a biomarker for colorectal neoplasia, with potential implications in some but perhaps not all populations.",

        "abstract": "Understanding biomarker transitions from normal physiological states to malignancy requires moving beyond differential expression toward regulatory network level characterization. This study aims to advance gene regulatory network (GRN) based biomarker transition methodologies by capturing condition-specific regulatory rewiring in lung cancer (LC). Two independent LC gene expression datasets were harmonized, integrated, and normalized for unified network inference. A robust gene set was obtained through the intersection of simulated annealing based selection, variance based screening, and volcano plot analysis. Regulatory interactions were inferred separately for normal and disease states using coexpression networks, along with our proposed Focused Random Forest (FRF) based GRNs, and Global Dual Random Forest (GDRF) framework. A comparative analysis revealed widespread disruption of coordinated gene expression and substantial regulatory remodeling during disease progression. Centrality measures identified CLDN18, CPB2, GJB2, MT1M, MMP12, WIF1, and GREM1 as key biomarker drivers. Directed GRNs demonstrated gene specific phase transitions through shifts in regulator target relationships. GDRF analysis revealed a transition in regulatory dominance from GJB2 and GREM1 in the normal state to CLDN18 and CPB2 in LC. The novelty of this work lies in the unified integration of local and global Random Forest based GRN inference to quantify biomarker phase shifts through directed regulatory remodeling.",

Recent experimental data have identified ALDH4A1 as a mitochondrial self-antigen implicated in atherosclerosis, yet its clinical significance in human autoimmunity remains unexplored. We aimed to characterize ALDH4A1 and anti-ALDH4A1 antibody levels in early RA, and evaluate their associations with atherosclerosis burden and lipoprotein traits. Methods: ALDH4A1 and anti-ALDH4A1 antibodies (IgM, IgG, IgA, and IgG subclasses) were measured in early RA (n=82), clinically suspect arthralgia (n=14), healthy controls (n=70), and a validation cohort of established RA. A prospective cohort (n=13) explored therapeutic modulation under TNF blockade. Associations with atherosclerosis burden, lipid/lipoprotein profiles, oxylipin signatures, proteomics, and cell-free DNA were assessed. Results: ALDH4A1 serum levels were associated with apoptotic-related proteomic pathways, cell-free DNA and lipidomic signatures in early RA. Reduced anti-ALDH4A1 antibodies were found, although divergent patters were noted across isotypes. These differences were confirmed in a validation cohort. IgG (predominantly IgG3) anti-ALDH4A1 correlated with favourable lipoprotein traits and cardiometabolic risk factors. Increased ALDH4A1 and reduced IgM/IgG anti-ALDH4A1 antibodies independently predicted atherosclerosis and improved risk stratification beyond mSCORE, most notably for IgG. ALDH4A1 tracked with TNF dynamics under TNF blockade, whereas increases in IgG antibodies occurred in responders and paralleled changes in lipoprotein features. Conclusions: The ALDH4A1/anti-ALDH4A1 axis emerges as a novel player bridging lipid disturbances and atherosclerosis along the RA spectrum, hence highlighting the involvement of mitochondrial targets. These components hold promise as functional players, clinical tools and therapeutic targets.",

        "abstract": "Implant-based breast reconstruction is the most common surgical option following mastectomy for breast cancer. Despite its prevalence, up to one-third of patients develop complications within two years. Existing machine-learning models for predicting the complications rely solely on structured clinical data, overlooking prognostic information in narrative pathology reports. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) enable extraction of numeric and semantic information from clinical text, offering opportunities to improve predictive performance and interpretability. We developed a fully on-premises, open-source model that extracts numeric morphometrics and contextual embeddings from free-text pathology reports, and fuses them with 63 structured variables via a CLIP-style dual encoder. In a single-center cohort of 963 patients (Jan 2007-Jan 2022), the multimodal model improved composite-complication risk discrimination (AUROC from 0.691 with logistic regression, increased to 0.740 with clinical features, and further improved to 0.764 with the addition of pathology report text features: p=0.027) and enhanced sensitivity and positive predictive value at clinical thresholds. The automated extraction module we developed for numeric morphometrics (e.g. mastectomy-specimen weight) from free-text pathology reports achieved an accuracy of 96.3%. SHAP analyses confirmed established risk factors expander-to-implant interval, body-mass index, and total mastectomy weight as dominant drivers. In subgroup analyses, model performance remained robust, with particularly strong discrimination observed among specific populations, such as shorter expander-to-implant interval (EII), the AUROC reached 0.796 and accuracy was 0.7999. These results show that on-premises, open-source LLMs reliably extract and fuse textual and structured clinical features to achieve clinically meaningful gains in predicting complications after implant-based breast reconstruction. While traditional models are constrained by the limited scope of structured variables, pathology text when analyzed with modern language models adds new, clinically relevant signals. Even modest statistical gains yield more accurate identification of high-risk patients, potentially informing surgical planning, patient counseling, and postoperative follow-up. These findings demonstrate that privacy-preserving language models, when integrated with contrastive multimodal alignment, can unlock prognostic information embedded in narrative pathology reports and enable interpretable, patient-level decision support. This interpretable, privacy-preserving multimodal framework offers a generalizable approach for enhancing risk prediction and clinical decision-making across surgical oncology.",

To assess whether artificial intelligence (AI)-enhanced prognostication may enrich the clinical risk groups utilized in the adjuvant NATALEE trial, we evaluated Ataraxis Breast RISK (ATX), a multimodal AI test that integrates clinical data with morphological features from H&E-stained slides. ATX risk scores were generated for 2,228 patients with HR+/HER2- early breast cancer, of which 918 (41%) were classified as clinical high-risk and 1,310 (59%) were clinical low-risk. ATX was significantly associated with recurrence-free interval in both clinical risk groups and identified high-risk patients not captured by current clinical criteria, as well as individuals with limited benefit despite clinical high-risk classification. Consequently, integration of AI-enhanced risk assessment may improve selection of patients likely to benefit from adjuvant CDK4/6 inhibitors relative to current criteria.",

Our results demonstrate that the older models remain the best choice for studying CpG methylation. We note substantial improvement of newer tools in identifying 5-methylcytosine in non-CG contexts, 6-methyladenine, and 4-methylcytosine. We highlight the sensitivity of various tools to confounding methylation nearby. We also assess the computational performance of various tools, and effects of sequencing depth, methylation abundance, read quality, and basecalling mode. Our reusable pipelines and fully open access datasets provide a framework of resources to empower future benchmarking efforts. Our work thus details the strengths and limitations of the state-of-the-art methylation models and outlines practical guidelines for researchers using nanopore sequencing to study DNA modifications.",

Herein, through circRNA profiling of 38 breast tumors and 10 benign breast tissues, we identified 509 of differentially expressed circRNAs. Integration with transcriptome-wide functional screening of approximately 10,000 circRNAs pinpointed circNSD1 as a top ranked tumor suppressor in breast cancer. CircNSD1 is downregulated in tumors and suppression of the circular form, but not the linear form, promotes breast cancer proliferation and tumor growth. Mechanistically, circNSD1 interacts with autophagy receptor SQSTM1/p62 and inhibits the oligomerization of p62, thereby suppressing p62 body formation and p62-dependent autophagy. Furthermore, circNSD1 ameliorates p62-mediated Keap1 sequestration, hence suppresses the Nrf2 pathway and oxidative stress tolerance. Our study provides a landscape view of the transcription and function of circRNA in breast cancer, and uncovers the crucial role of circNSD1 in autophagy and antioxidant stress.",

Despite the extensive profiling of circRNAs, their individual functions remain poorly understood. To fill this gap, we designed a genome-wide library of 65,300 shRNAs, targeting 9,688 clinically relevant circRNAs and 3,981 of their linear parental genes, and conducted functional screening in seven types of human cancer. We identified a total of 1,342 essential circRNAs (13.8% of screened) that impact cell proliferation in at least one cell line, and in 96.5% of the cases, the linear counterparts are not essential. While the majority of circRNAs are functional in a cell type-specific manner, a shared common subset emerges as functional regulators across all examined cell lines. We further discerned the functional relevance of two cancer type-specific circRNAs, circMPP6(2,3,4,5) in prostate cancer and circACVR2A(2,3,4) in breast cancer. For a comprehensive presentation of the functional circRNA landscape in cancer, we introduce FunCirc, an online database encompassing functional oncogenic circRNAs across cancer cell lines and several studies, coupled with circRNA expression profiles from diverse cancer and tissue types.

The biological mechanisms behind the anti-cancer effects of these medications are an area of intense research interest. Recently, Yang et al.4 found that platelet-derived thromboxane A2 (TXA2) inhibits T-cell activity through the expression of the guanine exchange factor ARHGEF1, and that aspirin was able to inhibit ARHGEF1 expression and preserve T-cell functionality and cancer immunity by blocking TXA2 production4. TXA2 production is inhibited by the effect of aspirin on cyclooxygenase-1 (COX-1). Celecoxib, a selective COX-2 inhibitor, does not inhibit platelet TXA2 production but has shown almost identical efficacy to aspirin in controlled clinical trials3. Here, we show that the enzyme mammalian neuraminidase 1 (NEU1) is involved in the activation and downstream signaling of the TXA2 receptor (TP) on T cells in response to TXA2. Both aspirin and celecoxib significantly inhibited TXA2-induced NEU1 activity and reduced ARHGEF1 expression. This regulation of the TP receptor by NEU1 may explain why aspirin and celecoxib demonstrated comparable clinical efficacy despite only aspirin being able to inhibit TXA2 synthesis. Targeting NEU1 may provide a novel therapeutic strategy against cancer cell metastasis by preserving a functional T-cell response against cancer.",

        "abstract": "A key limitation in cancer transcriptomics is the lack of accompanying genomic profiling such as whole-genome sequencing (WGS) or copy number alteration (CNA) data. Here we address this by showing that RNA-seq alone can be used to infer chromosomal aberrations and identify biologically meaningful patterns in lung cancer. Through a large-scale meta-analysis of publicly available RNA-seq datasets from non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), small cell lung cancer (SCLC), and matched controls, we reconstructed large scale CNA profiles and identified deletions in 3p, 9p, and 17p as the most frequent genomic events. Validation against paired WGS data confirmed a high degree of accuracy for RNA-seq-based inference. Our analyses revealed that while deletion-associated transcriptional heterogeneity exists, approximately 25% of differentially expressed genes were shared across all three deletion classes, indicating a conserved oncogenic program in lung cancer. Enrichment analysis linked these shared genes to pathways governing cell division, DNA replication, and extracellular matrix organization, while deletion-specific effects reflected disruption of tumor suppressor pathways, notably p53 signaling in 17p-deleted tumors, leading to deregulation of NOS2 and PLOD2. Integrating gene-level expression data, we identified both shared and deletion-specific biomarkers: TPX2 was consistently overexpressed across all deletion groups, while PTPRZ1 and CLDN9 were uniquely associated with del3p and del9p, respectively. Experimental validation in lung cancer cell lines confirmed these predictions, particularly the upregulation of CLDN9 in del9p carriers. By demonstrating that RNA-seq data can capture large-scale chromosomal events and reveal their transcriptional consequences, this study establishes an efficient framework for genomic inference and biomarker discovery, introducing CLDN9 as a novel, deletion-specific marker with potential prognostic and therapeutic value for 9p-deleted lung cancers.",

Activation of the STING pathway can suppress NSCLC. However, the clinical translation of STING agonists remains hindered by challenges such as off-target effects, metabolic instability, and suboptimal pharmacokinetics. In this study, we engineered two oncolytic adenoviruses (OAds), OAd-HcGAS and OAd-McGAS, expressing human or murine cGAS, respectively, using an Ad5/3 chimeric adenovirus platform under regulation by the hTERT promoter to evaluatewhether OVs carrying the cGAS gene are capable of specifically activating the STING pathway within tumors and enhancing the anti - tumor efficacy of OVs both in vitro and in vivo.In vitro, OAd-HcGAS exhibited robust replication and potent cytolytic activity in tumor cells. It activated the STING-TBK1-IRF3 signaling axis, triggering a strong type I interferon (IFN-I) and pro-inflammatory cytokine response without compromising viral replication. In a murine Lewis lung carcinoma allograft model, intratumoral (i.t.) administration of OAd-McGAS led to substantial cGAS expression and consequential activation of the STING pathway. Moreover, the combination with anti-PD-L1 therapy resulted in tumor regression in over half of the cases. Notably, this armed oncolytic virus strategy enhanced the activation and infiltration of multiple immune cell populations. Collectively, these findings establish cGAS-expressing oncolytic adenoviruses as a novel and effective therapeutic strategy for lung cancer treatment.\n\nGraphical AbstractViral replication & Transgene expression & Cancer treatment",

We report OncoSCOUT, a cancer detection strategy using T cells engineered with protease-activatable receptors (PARs) that conditionally recognize tumor cells and release a synthetic biomarker for detection in urine. These PARs comprise masked synthetic Notch receptors in which antigen binding is blocked by a peptide mimotope tethered via a protease-cleavable linker. We demonstrate that requiring both extracellular protease activity and tumor antigen recognition improves spatial specificity and minimizes off-tumor activation of PAR T cells in vivo. To identify tumor-selective PARs, we adoptively transferred a HER2-targeted PAR library displaying [~]160,000 unique 4-mer amino acid linkers and discovered multiple variants significantly enriched in a HER2-positive cancer xenograft model. Using a single customized PAR, we show that OncoSCOUT can detect total tumor burdens as small as 10-30 mm3 with significantly improved sensitivity than the protein biomarker CA 15-3 or a 20-plex circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assay.",

Sex differences in AVS arise in part from sexually dimorphic serum composition that differentially regulate valvular interstitial cell (VIC) myofibroblast activation. However, how individual serum factors contribute to sex-specific drug responses targeting VIC myofibroblast activation remains unknown. Here, we integrate serum proteomic profiling with in vitro drug screening using hydrogel biomaterials to identify sex-specific regulators of antifibrotic drug efficacy. We found that Insulin-like Growth Factor Binding Protein 2 (IGFBP2) serum levels are associated with resistance to the antifibrotic drug Evogliptin only in female VICs cultured with female AVS serum. This mechanism is driven by IGFBP2-mediated activation of Rho/ROCK and focal adhesion kinase signaling pathways that counteract Evogliptin treatment. Our findings reveal a sex-specific, serum-mediated mechanism of Evogliptin resistance and highlight IGFBP2 as a candidate biomarker for stratifying female AVS patients for Evogliptin treatment. More broadly, these findings underscore the importance of incorporating sex-stratified biomarker analyses into AVS therapeutic development to improve patient-specific treatment recommendations.",

Specific cellular ecosystems that originate anti-tumor activity or predict immunotherapy response remain poorly characterized. To this end, we developed a high-resolution, multimodal spatial atlas jointly profiling transcriptomics, proteomics, and histology to characterize TLS maturation in NSCLC alongside secondary lymph organs as a baseline. Using this atlas, we proposed a pathologist-in-the-loop framework that combines a variational graph autoencoder (VGAE) with diffusion pseudotime to refine human expert annotations and characterize TLS maturation. These spatial molecular representations were extended to H&E whole-slide images via a vision transformer-based foundation model. Next, we resolved cellular composition, spatial organization, and cell-cell interactions within these data and defined two divergent spatial ecosystems. Clinical evidence suggests that these ecosystems are associated with distinct patient outcomes: a mature germinal center niche with favorable prognoses, and a tumor-macrophage-fibroblast niche with unfavorable prognoses. In summary, our work decodes key components of TLS heterogeneity, identifies hallmark spatial patterns involved in NSCLC adaptive immunity, and provides a framework for translating spatial omics insights into clinical applications.",

        "abstract": "Cognitive control organizes contexts, stimuli, and actions into hierarchically structured representations that support flexible, goal-directed behavior. This organization allows appropriate actions to be selected in response to changing demands, contexts, and sensory inputs. Critically, different hierarchical levels place unequal demands on flexibility: sensory-motor plans must be updated rapidly to enable behavioral flexibility, whereas higher-level contextual goals are typically updated less frequently. A behavioral consequence of managing these demands is the task switch cost, the performance penalty observed when task representations are reconfigured across trials. Here, we investigated the behavioral and neural sources of switch costs using a hierarchical control task that dissociates context reconfiguration from subordinate rule switching. Functional MRI and behavioral data were collected from healthy human participants (both male and female). Behaviorally, subordinate rule switches were faster than context switches but were more strongly influenced by task-irrelevant perceptual changes, whereas context switches were relatively insensitive to such interference. To characterize the neural basis of these effects, we introduced a novel measure \"neural distance\", which quantifies trial-to-trial reconfiguration of multivoxel activity patterns. Across the brain, larger neural distances predicted larger RT switch costs, linking representational reorganization to behavioral performance. Importantly, representational reconfiguration differed across hierarchical levels and anatomical systems. Subordinate rule updating was modulated by perceptual input and expressed in distributed perceptual and motor networks, whereas context reconfiguration engaged the lateral middle frontal cortex and was comparatively insulated from interference. Our results reveal the structure of neural representations supporting flexible updating and interference-shielded contextual representations subserving control behavior.\n\nSignificanceDaily activities often require a mixture of both high and low flexibility demands that need to be performed concurrently. Driving requires maintaining a stable destination goal while rapidly updating motor plans (brake, accelerate, turn, etc.) in response to changing sensory information. Although people perform such tasks with ease, it remains unclear how neural and cognitive representations are structured to respond to these different demands. The present study suggests that sensory-motor plans prioritize high flexibility by allowing greater influence from sensory inputs, which can create interference across brain networks when that input is task-irrelevant. Contextual information is shielded from this interference by representing contexts as distinctly as possible in the lateral prefrontal cortex, resulting in slower but more stable context switching.",

Here, we show that the septin cytoskeleton buffers the actomyosin forces that power nuclear movement. Septin filaments comprising SEPT9, a septin amplified in breast cancer, align with perinuclear actomyosin cables which exhibit higher tensile stress during 3D confined migration through narrower pores. SEPT9 depletion amplifies actin stress during confined migration and after myosin II hyper-activation in non-migrating cells causing actin and nuclear envelope ruptures. Following confined migration, DNA breaks, nuclear blebs, micronuclei and cell death increase in SEPT9-depleted cells, phenotypes rescued by the oncogenic SEPT9 isoform 1. Clinicogenomic data reveal that SEPT9 amplification associates with lower genomic alteration in aggressive breast tumors and higher patient mortality. We propose that septins are a mechanoprotective element of the cytoskeleton, and SEPT9 amplification enhances tumor cell survival by preventing nuclear damage.",

Applying fastMHN to a large clinical cohort, we identify a tumor-progression group spanning multiple tissues that is characterized by a link between STK11 mutations and poor patient survival. While the clinical relevance of STK11 mutations is well established in non-small cell lung cancer, our results suggest that a similar progression mechanism is present in molecularly defined subgroups of other cancer types. These findings illustrate how scalable pan-cancer progression modeling can facilitate cross-entity transfer of biological and potentially clinical insights.\n\nAvailability and implementationThe pan-cancer classification workflow and all data are available at github.com/simon-pfahler/fastMHN-classification.",

Among the K. pneumoniae isolates, we identified sequence types (ST) 39, 101, 147, 307 and 395, as well as a predominating clonal group--CG10146 (ST23 KL57), first detected in Moscow--carrying a hybrid virulence-resistance plasmid encoding NDM-1 and aerobactin. Over two years (2023-2025), this clonal group expanded and acquired pan-resistance. When tested in virulence assays, only one isolate (ST395) displayed hypervirulence in a Galleria mellonella though not in a mouse infection model. Several phages isolated from Ukrainian sewage were able to lyse these K. pneumoniae strains, including strains obtained from soldiers displaced in Belgium, Germany, and Latvia. Bacterial resistance was observed during in vitro testing. However, some phage-resistant isolates had mutations in virulence factors, including one that completely lost its hybrid plasmid, resulting in restored antibiotic susceptibility. Strategies like Phage Sp UKR are essential to prevent the selection, persistence, and global spread of these MDR clones.",

        "abstract": "The greater wax moth, Galleria mellonella, is an increasingly important invertebrate model for infection biology, yet silk extrusion during handling complicates larval injections and hampers survival assessment. Here, we develop and characterise a simple cold-shock method that reliably inhibits silk production without compromising larval viability. Larvae exposed to -20 degC for 10 minutes completely suppress silk extrusion with 100% survival, representing a substantial improvement over previous chilling approaches. Cold-shocked larvae successfully remained capable of completing development, although pupation and adult emergence were delayed, body weight and fecundity were reduced, and wing deformities were more common. While cold-shock did not alter silk gland morphology, spinneret structure, or fibroin gene expression, confocal imaging revealed pronounced disorganisation of F-actin and a-tubulin networks within silk gland cells, indicating cytoskeletal disruption as a likely mechanism underlying silk inhibition. When challenged with Escherichia coli, cold-shocked larvae responded comparably to controls, with survival influenced primarily by feeding status. Together, these findings demonstrate that short-term cold-shock provides an efficient, reproducible, and easy implemented method for preventing silk extrusion in Galleria larvae, markedly improving handling and experimental safety while preserving their suitability as a model host for pathogen research.",

Here, we demonstrate that state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based proteomics enables in-depth proteomic profiling of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), including small biopsies and single tissue sections mounted on glass slides. Despite minimal input material, single-slide analyses of clinical lung tumor specimens yielded biologically and clinically informative data, supporting detection of actionable proteins, immune-related signatures, and multivariate biomarkers. These results establish the feasibility of proteomics for retrospective FFPE studies and routine clinical practice, expanding opportunities for biomarker discovery and precision medicine from scarce tissue material.",

In the present study, we focused on the regulation of insulin growth factor-like family member 1 (IGFL1) in MCF7 breast cancer cells in response to pro-inflammatory IL-1{beta} and observed an induction of both transcription and translation. We characterized the 3 untranslated region as regulatory hub for the post-transcriptional regulation and identified a distinct G-rich region to confer the IL-1{beta}-dependent translational increase. Our study therefore provides new insights into the translation regulation of IGFL1 in the context of an inflammatory tumor microenvironment.",

        "abstract": "Glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) is an important clinical biomarker of traumatic brain injury (TBI), yet understanding the nature, timing, and impact of its degraded and modified products is needed for clinical utility. We report distinct GFAP breakdown products (BDPs) and post-translational modifications (PTMs) that are unique to TBI. Mapped PTMs provided fragment and patient-specific citrullination signatures known for destabilizing GFAP filaments. GFAP and its fragments from patients cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and serum were sequenced by mass spectrometry (MS), identifying two TBI-specific coproducts covering coil1 (20-26kDa) and coil2 (15-19kDa) in the rod-domain. These coproducts were imbalanced in biofluids with coil1-BDPs enriched over coil2-BDPs detected by label-free quantitative MS and independently confirmed by immunoblot densitometry in twenty-three TBI patients. Ten-day temporal trajectories showed ongoing proteolysis, progressing from large to small fragments, with prolonged elevation of 37/39kDa fragments, and delayed rise of small products. For the first time, profiles of GFAP fragments, but not of uncleaved GFAP, predicted six-month outcome (Extended Glasgow Outcome Scale, GOSE), highlighting proteolytic processing as prognostic biomarker signature. These new TBI-GFAP-BDPs were independently substantiated in a human culture trauma model, offering mechanistic insights and linking biomarker data to injury-induced astrocytopathy. To this end, specific findings include: Coil1-BPDs were fluid-released, while coil2-BDPs remained cellular, shown by epitope-defined coil-specific GFAP antibodies. A new cleavage site between the two coils was identified by selective epitope loss. Coil2 cellular retention could be explained by incorporation of citrullinated coil2-BDPs into non-filamentous aggregates within pathological astrocytes after injury. Trauma-triggered proteolysis involved calpains and caspases in distinct astrocyte injury states documented using inhibitors and live-cell reporters. These novel degradation findings have significant translational relevance for monitoring disease progression in TBI patients and for linking biofluid GFAP fragments to a trauma-inflicted astroglial proteinopathy during neurodegeneration.",
