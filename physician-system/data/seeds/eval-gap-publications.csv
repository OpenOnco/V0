35657320,"Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis Guiding Adjuvant Therapy in Stage II Colon Cancer (DYNAMIC trial)",randomized trial,colorectal,DYNAMIC trial - Stage II colon cancer ctDNA-guided adjuvant therapy. ctDNA-guided approach was non-inferior to standard management for recurrence-free survival. ctDNA-guided arm reduced adjuvant chemo use from 28% to 15% without compromising outcomes. 3-year RFS 92.5% ctDNA-negative no chemo vs 86.4% ctDNA-positive with chemo.,Natera,10.1056/NEJMoa2200075,New England Journal of Medicine,2022
29590544,"Duration of Adjuvant Chemotherapy for Stage III Colon Cancer (IDEA collaboration)",randomized trial,colorectal,IDEA trial - International Duration Evaluation of Adjuvant chemotherapy. 3 months vs 6 months of oxaliplatin-based adjuvant chemo in stage III colon cancer. Non-inferiority of 3 months not confirmed overall but was confirmed for CAPOX in low-risk (T1-3 N1) patients. Neurotoxicity substantially lower with 3 months.,,10.1056/NEJMoa1713709,New England Journal of Medicine,2018
35139274,"Event-free Survival with Pembrolizumab in Early Triple-Negative Breast Cancer (KEYNOTE-522)",randomized trial,breast,KEYNOTE-522 trial - Phase 3 RCT of neoadjuvant pembrolizumab + chemotherapy followed by adjuvant pembrolizumab in early TNBC (stage II-III). pCR rate 63.0% vs 55.6% with chemo alone. EFS significantly improved with pembrolizumab (HR 0.63). 3-year EFS 84.5% vs 76.8%. FDA-approved regimen for high-risk early TNBC. Relevant to MRD context: MRD-positive TNBC patients post-CREATE-X may consider pembrolizumab-based strategies.,,10.1056/NEJMoa2112651,New England Journal of Medicine,2022
