      "question": "I have a 58-year-old with stage III colon cancer, T3N2, who underwent right hemicolectomy. Signatera came back MRD-positive at the 4-week post-op timepoint. Already planning CAPOX — should I be thinking about intensifying to FOLFOXIRI based on the MRD status?",
      "response": "DECISION: Whether to intensify adjuvant therapy beyond standard CAPOX in ctDNA-positive stage III colon cancer.\n\nOPTION A: Continue planned CAPOX for 6 months with serial ctDNA monitoring.\nThe GALAXY study (Signatera, tumor-informed) showed that ctDNA positivity at 4 weeks post-surgery strongly predicts recurrence (HR 10.0 for DFS), and ctDNA clearance during adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved outcomes [6]. Your patient's T3N2 status represents high-risk stage III disease, where the IDEA collaboration confirmed that 6 months of CAPOX remains standard therapy [4]. Serial Signatera monitoring can track molecular response and provide early detection of recurrence (median 5.3 months before imaging) [6].\n\nOPTION B: Clinical trial enrollment for ctDNA-guided intensification.\nCIRCULATE-US is actively recruiting ctDNA-positive stage III patients and randomizing to intensified therapy including mFOLFIRINOX versus standard adjuvant approaches [3]. The CLAUDIA trial specifically evaluates intensification to mFOLFIRINOX-FOLFIRI in MRD-positive patients during adjuvant therapy [7]. Additional trials (FINE) are testing ctDNA-guided intensification strategies [8]. These represent the most rigorous approach to answer whether ctDNA-positivity warrants escalation beyond standard therapy.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: No completed RCT has demonstrated survival benefit from intensifying beyond standard adjuvant therapy based solely on ctDNA positivity in stage III CRC. The optimal threshold for intervention and specific intensification regimens remain investigational.",

      "question": "Stage III rectal cancer patient, completed 3 months of FOLFOX post-surgery. Signatera just came back MRD-negative. Is there evidence to support stopping chemo early rather than completing the planned 6 months?",
      "response": "DECISION: Whether to shorten adjuvant FOLFOX from planned 6 months to 3 months based on MRD-negative status in stage III rectal cancer.\n\nOPTION A: Complete planned 6-month FOLFOX course despite MRD-negative status.\nThe IDEA collaboration showed that 3-month FOLFOX was inferior to 6 months in stage III colon cancer overall (HR 1.16, 95% CI 1.06-1.26), supporting completion of the full 6-month course [5]. GALAXY data confirm that sustained ctDNA clearance correlates with favorable outcomes, but this doesn't validate shortening therapy based on negative results alone [4]. Standard guidelines continue to recommend 6 months of oxaliplatin-based therapy for stage III disease regardless of ctDNA status.\n\nOPTION B: Consider shortening to 3 months based on MRD-negative result and low-risk features.\nGALAXY showed that ctDNA clearance during adjuvant therapy was associated with improved outcomes, suggesting MRD-negative patients may have lower recurrence risk [4]. For low-risk stage III patients (T1-3 N1), IDEA demonstrated that 3 months was non-inferior to 6 months regardless of regimen (3-year DFS 83.1% vs 83.3%) [5]. However, this was based on pathologic risk factors, not ctDNA status.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: No RCT has validated MRD-guided duration decisions in stage III CRC. DYNAMIC-III is studying this question but results are pending [3]. The optimal timing and frequency of serial MRD monitoring during treatment remains undefined. Rectal cancer may have different biology than colon cancer, but MRD-guided data are largely from mixed populations.",

      "response": "DECISION: Adjuvant chemotherapy approach in MRD-positive stage II colon cancer without standard high-risk features.\n\nOPTION A: Initiate adjuvant chemotherapy based on MRD positivity.\nThe DYNAMIC trial demonstrated that ctDNA-positive stage II colon cancer patients who received adjuvant therapy had 86.4% three-year recurrence-free survival versus significantly worse outcomes in ctDNA-positive patients who did not receive treatment [1]. GALAXY data showed ctDNA positivity at 4 weeks post-surgery conferred a hazard ratio of 10.0 for disease-free survival [3]. Historical data indicate >80% recurrence risk when ctDNA-positive patients receive no adjuvant treatment [6]. Standard FOLFOX or CAPOX regimens are appropriate, with serial ctDNA monitoring to assess molecular response.\n\nOPTION B: Enroll in MRD-guided clinical trial.\nThe COBRA trial (NCT04068103) specifically enrolled stage IIA colon cancer patients for ctDNA-guided treatment decisions and has completed accrual [8]. CLAUDIA is currently recruiting stage II-III patients for treatment intensification based on persistent MRD during adjuvant therapy [4].\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: DYNAMIC enrolled stage II patients but did not specifically analyze the T4aN0 subset separately [1].

Importantly, 72% of ctDNA-positive patients in c-TRAK TN already had metastatic disease at detection, suggesting the need for earlier and more frequent monitoring strategies [1]. Current trials may be evaluating more intensive intervention approaches or earlier detection windows for MRD-positive TNBC patients.\n\nOPTION B: Intensified surveillance with serial ctDNA monitoring.\nWhile specific MRD monitoring schedules aren't established in breast cancer guidelines, the c-TRAK TN experience suggests quarterly monitoring may miss the optimal intervention window [1]. ESMO guidelines recognize that ctDNA clearance after chemotherapy is associated with improved outcomes, though optimal timepoints for analysis remain undefined [8]. More frequent monitoring (monthly or bi-monthly) could potentially detect molecular progression before metastatic spread.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: No completed RCT has demonstrated survival benefit from MRD-guided escalation beyond standard therapy in TNBC.

      "response": "DECISION: Management approach for molecularly detected recurrence in HR+/HER2- breast cancer with positive surveillance ctDNA but negative imaging.\n\nOPTION A: Initiate systemic therapy for molecular relapse with baseline imaging and biomarker assessment.\nEvidence suggests ctDNA positivity during surveillance indicates micrometastatic disease requiring treatment. NCCN Breast Cancer v1.2026 recommends assessing for ESR1 mutations at progression following endocrine therapy, with ctDNA preferred over tissue [3]. This biomarker testing guides selection of next-line endocrine therapy (fulvestrant, elacestrant for ESR1-mutated disease) or consideration of CDK4/6 inhibitor combinations. Baseline staging scans are essential to establish extent of disease before treatment initiation.\n\nOPTION B: Intensified surveillance with serial ctDNA monitoring and interval imaging.\n⚠️ CROSS-INDICATION: The c-TRAK TN trial in triple-negative breast cancer found that 72% of ctDNA-positive patients already had detectable metastases on staging scans at the time of molecular detection [2]. While this was a different breast cancer subtype with more aggressive biology than HR+ disease, it highlights that ctDNA positivity often coincides with radiographically detectable disease. This supports more frequent imaging (every 2-3 months) alongside serial Signatera monitoring to capture the narrow window before overt metastases.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: Lead time between ctDNA detection and radiographic progression in HR+/HER2- breast cancer is not well-characterized. ESMO acknowledges the lack of data on optimal management of ctDNA-positive cases during surveillance [8]. The optimal intervention threshold for Signatera MTM/mL levels in breast cancer remains undefined.",

      "response": "DECISION: Adjuvant therapy approach in EGFR+ stage IIB NSCLC with MRD-positive status on Signatera.\n\nOPTION A: Standard adjuvant osimertinib per ADAURA protocol regardless of MRD status.\nThe ADAURA trial established adjuvant osimertinib as standard-of-care for resected stage IB-IIIA EGFR+ NSCLC, showing significant DFS and OS benefits [4]. This recommendation applies to your stage IIB patient independent of MRD status — ADAURA did not stratify by ctDNA, and the survival benefit was demonstrated across all enrolled stages. MRD positivity identifies higher recurrence risk but does not contraindicate the proven targeted therapy approach.\n\nOPTION B: Consider MRD-guided therapy intensification through clinical trial enrollment.\nMERMAID-1 (phase III) tested ctDNA-guided adjuvant durvalumab in resected stage II-III NSCLC but excluded EGFR+ patients who have targeted therapy options [8]. No completed trials have specifically addressed MRD-guided escalation in EGFR+ resected NSCLC. Observational data show that 85% of patients who recurred had ctDNA detected with ~6-month lead time [5], supporting MRD monitoring utility.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: No prospective data exist for MRD-guided therapy modifications in EGFR+ resected NSCLC. The optimal duration of adjuvant osimertinib (standard 3 years vs MRD-guided extension) remains unstudied. Whether combination approaches (osimertinib plus immunotherapy) benefit MRD-positive EGFR+ patients is unknown.",

      "response": "DECISION: Serial ctDNA monitoring frequency in a stage III CRC patient who achieved molecular clearance during adjuvant FOLFOX.\n\nOPTION A: Continue serial monitoring every 3 months through completion of adjuvant therapy.\nThe GALAXY study (Signatera, tumor-informed) demonstrated that ctDNA clearance during adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with improved outcomes compared to persistent ctDNA positivity [6]. Serial monitoring provided meaningful clinical information, detecting molecular relapse a median of 5.3 months before radiographic relapse [6]. Continuing q3-month monitoring through treatment completion allows real-time assessment of treatment response and early detection of molecular recurrence while therapy can still be modified.\n\nOPTION B: Extend monitoring interval or defer until completion of adjuvant therapy.\nMolecular clearance indicates favorable treatment response, and the patient is receiving standard-of-care FOLFOX with good molecular response. Some clinicians defer serial draws until treatment completion to avoid over-testing during active therapy, particularly when results would not change the current treatment plan. However, this approach lacks direct validation data for optimal timing.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: No RCT has established the optimal monitoring frequency for patients achieving molecular clearance during adjuvant therapy. The clinical utility of detecting molecular recurrence during active treatment (versus post-treatment surveillance) remains unproven.

      "response": "DECISION: Whether to order pre-treatment ctDNA testing (NavDx) for treatment response monitoring in HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer planned for definitive chemoradiation.\n\nOPTION A: Order baseline NavDx for future monitoring and consider clinical trial enrollment.\nIn our current evidence set, one study evaluated tumor-informed ctDNA (RaDaR assay) in head and neck cancer, detecting ctDNA in 17/17 patients at baseline with sensitivity to 0.0006% VAF post-treatment [1]. However, this study focused on p16-negative HNSCC patients undergoing surgery, not HPV-positive disease treated with chemoradiation. NavDx is specifically designed for HPV-driven cancers and has ongoing validation studies, but published outcome data in oropharyngeal cancer are limited in our database.\n\nOPTION B: Proceed with standard imaging-based response assessment without ctDNA testing.\nStandard post-treatment surveillance with clinical examination and imaging remains the established approach for HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer. No RCT has yet demonstrated clinical benefit from ctDNA-guided decisions in head and neck cancer.\n\nEvidence from Other Indications:\nCross-indication data from colorectal and breast cancers show potential for ctDNA-guided therapy decisions. DYNAMIC demonstrated non-inferior outcomes using ctDNA to guide adjuvant therapy in stage II colon cancer [3]. c-TRAK TN showed feasibility of ctDNA-triggered interventions in breast cancer, though 72% of ctDNA-positive patients already had metastatic disease at detection [2].\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: Published ctDNA data specific to HPV-positive oropharyngeal cancer treated with definitive chemoradiation may exist outside this database; consider a targeted literature search or trial enrollment for access to emerging evidence.",

However, the kinetics and optimal duration for achieving clearance on intensive regimens like FOLFOXIRI have not been established. Since your patient is tolerating treatment well, continuing the current regimen while monitoring ctDNA dynamics at regular intervals (e.g., every 2-3 cycles) may reveal delayed molecular response.\n\nOPTION B: Clinical trial enrollment for persistent ctDNA-positive disease.\nSeveral ongoing trials are specifically designed for ctDNA-guided decisions, including studies evaluating maintenance approaches for high-risk patients [5,8]. These trials may offer access to novel strategies for persistent MRD-positive patients that extend beyond standard adjuvant paradigms.\n\nEVIDENCE GAPS: In our current evidence set, we found limited direct data for managing persistent ctDNA positivity on maximal adjuvant therapy. The GALAXY study showed prognostic value of ctDNA dynamics but did not specifically address management when ctDNA fails to clear on intensive regimens [3].
