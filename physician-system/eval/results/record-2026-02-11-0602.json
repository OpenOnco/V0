      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III colon cancer (T3N2), 6 weeks post-resection, Signatera MRD-positive at 4-week timepoint.\nDECISION: Whether to intensify adjuvant therapy from planned CAPOX to FOLFOXIRI based on MRD status.\n\nOPTION A: Proceed with planned CAPOX without intensification.\n- Guidelines: NCCN explicitly states that \"de-escalation of care and treatment decision-making are not recommended based on ctDNA results\" [2], and notes \"there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of ctDNA assays outside of a clinical trial\" [3]. ESMO classifies ctDNA MRD as ESCAT level III (investigational) for treatment decisions, indicating MRD-guided therapy is not yet standard practice [4].\n- Evidence: The MRD-positive result is prognostic but not predictive for chemotherapy selection according to current guidelines [1]. Standard CAPOX remains the evidence-based backbone for stage III disease regardless of MRD status.\n- Caveats: This approach may miss an opportunity for early intervention if emerging MRD-guided intensification strategies prove beneficial.\n\nOPTION B: Intensify to FOLFOXIRI based on MRD-positive status.\n- Evidence: While no guidelines currently endorse MRD-guided escalation, ESMO acknowledges promising data from trials like DYNAMIC, though they await phase III confirmation [4]. Some centers are exploring intensification strategies for MRD-positive patients outside of trials.\n- Caveats: No prospective randomized trial has demonstrated overall survival benefit from MRD-guided therapy escalation in stage III CRC. Based on the available sources, guidelines do not recommend treatment decisions based on ctDNA results [2,3].\n\nOPTION C: Clinical trial enrollment.\n- Evidence: Given that NCCN states insufficient evidence exists for routine ctDNA use outside clinical trials [3], and ESMO considers MRD-guided therapy investigational [4], trial participation may be the most appropriate approach for this MRD-positive patient.\n- Benefits: Access to structured MRD-guided protocols with safety monitoring and contribution to evidence generation.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No completed phase III trial demonstrates survival benefit from intensifying therapy based on MRD-positive results in stage III CRC. The optimal action threshold for MRD positivity and whether intensification benefits vary by molecular subtype remain undefined.\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether Signatera's reported performance characteristics of 94% sensitivity and 98% specificity for recurrence surveillance in CRC are validated in the indexed evidence. It requires tumor tissue and has a 28-day initial turnaround time but only 9 days for monitoring. The indexed evidence does not specifically address the extent of CRC validation data or Medicare coverage details for this assay.",
