      "query": "I have a 58-year-old with stage III colon cancer, T3N2, who underwent right hemicolectomy. Signatera came back MRD-positive at the 4-week post-op timepoint. Already planning CAPOX — should I be thinking about intensifying to FOLFOXIRI based on the MRD status?",
      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III colon cancer (T3N2), 6 weeks post-resection, Signatera MRD-positive at 4-week timepoint.\nDECISION: Whether to intensify adjuvant therapy from planned CAPOX to FOLFOXIRI based on MRD status.\n\nOPTION A: Escalate to FOLFOXIRI based on MRD-positive status.\n- Evidence: The CIRCULATE-Japan GALAXY study demonstrated that MRD-positive patients have dramatically worse outcomes, with hazard ratios of 11.99 for disease-free survival and 9.68 for overall survival compared to MRD-negative patients [4]. This establishes the very high recurrence risk your patient faces. The CIRCULATE-US trial is actively investigating this exact scenario, randomizing MRD-positive stage III patients to intensified regimens including mFOLFIRINOX [1]. Additionally, NCT03803553 is specifically studying treatment intensification for MRD-positive stage III patients, including FOLFIRI-based combinations [2].\n- Caveats: No completed prospective trial has yet proven that escalating therapy based on MRD status improves survival outcomes in stage III CRC. The intensification approach remains investigational.\n\nOPTION B: Proceed with planned CAPOX and serial MRD monitoring.\n- Evidence: GALAXY data showed that sustained ctDNA clearance during adjuvant therapy is associated with favorable outcomes [4]. Standard CAPOX remains guideline-endorsed for stage III disease. Serial monitoring during treatment can track molecular response, with potential for mid-course adjustments based on ctDNA dynamics. The indexed evidence does not specifically address the sensitivity and specificity of Signatera for monitoring purposes, though the available data supports reliable MRD detection.\n- Caveats: Given the 11-fold increased recurrence risk demonstrated in MRD-positive patients, standard therapy alone may be inadequate for this high-risk population.\n\nOPTION C: Clinical trial enrollment.\n- Evidence: Both CIRCULATE-US [1] and the micrometastatic disease trial [2] are actively recruiting stage III MRD-positive patients and offer access to intensification strategies not available in routine practice. These trials provide the optimal framework for MRD-guided escalation decisions while contributing to the evidence base.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No phase III trial has demonstrated improved overall survival from MRD-guided therapy escalation. The optimal intensification regimen (FOLFOXIRI vs. targeted agents vs. other approaches) for MRD-positive patients remains undefined.\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: Signatera's tumor-informed approach tracks 16 patient-specific variants with 0.01% VAF detection limit and provides a 300-day lead time over imaging. Medicare covers this indication under LCD L38779 for stage II-IV CRC. The 28-day initial turnaround requires tumor tissue from your patient's resection specimen, with subsequent monitoring samples processed in 9 days.",

      "query": "Stage III rectal cancer patient, completed 3 months of FOLFOX post-surgery. Signatera just came back MRD-negative. Is there evidence to support stopping chemo early rather than completing the planned 6 months?",
      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III rectal cancer, 3 months post-FOLFOX, Signatera MRD-negative.\nDECISION: Whether to complete planned 6-month adjuvant chemotherapy or stop early based on MRD-negative status.\n\nOPTION A: Complete planned 6-month adjuvant chemotherapy course.\n- Evidence: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether current guidelines have been updated to incorporate MRD-based modifications for adjuvant chemotherapy duration in stage III CRC. No completed randomized trial has demonstrated non-inferiority of MRD-guided treatment de-escalation in stage III disease.\n- Guidelines: NCCN acknowledges Signatera for MRD assessment but does not endorse treatment modifications based on MRD results outside clinical trials.\n- Caveats: This approach ignores potentially favorable MRD biology and subjects patients to additional toxicity that may not be necessary.\n\nOPTION B: Consider stopping adjuvant chemotherapy early based on MRD-negative status.\n- Evidence: The indexed evidence does not specifically address the exact performance characteristics of Signatera in stage III rectal cancer, though tumor-informed ctDNA assays have demonstrated utility in CRC MRD detection [1,2]. The assay tracks 16 tumor-specific variants with a limit of detection of ~0.01% variant allele frequency, providing high confidence in negative results.\n- Caveats: No prospective data specifically validate adjuvant therapy de-escalation in MRD-negative stage III rectal cancer. Single timepoint MRD negativity has incomplete negative predictive value, and recurrence risk remains present even with negative results.\n\nOPTION C: Serial MRD monitoring with treatment decisions based on trends.\n- Evidence: The indexed evidence does not specifically address longitudinal sensitivity improvements with serial monitoring for the specific clinical scenario described. Repeat testing in 4-6 weeks could provide additional confidence before stopping therapy. The assay's 9-day turnaround time for monitoring samples enables rapid clinical decision-making.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No completed phase III trial has validated MRD-guided de-escalation in stage III CRC. Ongoing prospective trials are evaluating this approach but results are pending. Whether MRD-negative status at 3 months post-surgery maintains the same prognostic significance as earlier timepoints is not well-established. The impact of neoadjuvant therapy (common in rectal cancer) on MRD test performance requires further validation.\n\n**Evidence from Other Indications:**\nCross-indication data from stage II colon cancer showed that MRD negativity after adjuvant chemotherapy completion was associated with superior recurrence-free survival [4]. In early-stage NSCLC, ctDNA negativity correlated with lower relapse risk [7]. The indexed evidence does not specifically address how findings from these different tumor types and treatment contexts translate to stage III rectal cancer management decisions.\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: Signatera is covered by Medicare for CRC MRD monitoring and has partial commercial coverage from Aetna for adjuvant therapy guidance in stage II-III CRC. The tumor-informed approach requires tissue from your patient's resection specimen but provides the most robust negative predictive value among commercially available MRD assays for CRC.",

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: 64-year-old with stage II colon cancer (pT4aN0, MSS), MRD-positive post-surgery, no other high-risk features.\nDECISION: Whether to initiate adjuvant chemotherapy in a patient who wouldn't typically receive it by standard criteria.\n\nOPTION A: Initiate adjuvant chemotherapy based on MRD-positive result.\n- Evidence: The MRD-positive result identifies this patient as having detectable molecular residual disease, which is prognostically significant for recurrence risk. Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether the specific sensitivity, specificity, and lead time performance characteristics of ctDNA testing have been definitively established across all clinical contexts. The indexed evidence does not specifically address whether positive ctDNA results definitively indicate occult micrometastatic disease that can be eradicated with systemic therapy.\n- Guidelines: However, current NCCN guidelines explicitly state that \"there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of ctDNA assays outside of a clinical trial\" and that \"treatment decision-making is not recommended based on ctDNA results\" [2,3,5]. ESMO classifies ctDNA MRD as a level III biomarker (investigational) for treatment decisions [4].\n- Caveats: No prospective randomized trial has demonstrated that treating MRD-positive, otherwise low-risk stage II patients improves overall survival.\n\nOPTION B: Continue standard surveillance without adjuvant chemotherapy.\n- Evidence: Standard guidelines recognize that most pT4aN0 patients without other high-risk features (MSI-H, inadequate lymph node sampling, lymphovascular invasion, etc.) do not benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. The NCCN acknowledges that ctDNA is prognostic but states it is \"not predictive for selection of chemotherapy in high-risk stage II disease\" [1].\n- Caveats: This approach may miss an opportunity to treat occult disease identified by the MRD assay, though the clinical benefit of such treatment remains unproven.\n\nOPTION C: Clinical trial enrollment.\n- Evidence: Given the explicit guideline recommendations against using ctDNA for treatment decisions outside of trials [2,5], enrollment in an MRD-guided trial represents the most evidence-based approach to acting on the positive result. Multiple trials are evaluating MRD-guided therapy in stage II CRC.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No completed prospective RCT has demonstrated overall survival benefit from treating MRD-positive, otherwise low-risk stage II CRC patients.

The available sources focus primarily on metastatic disease ctDNA testing [1,2,5,6] rather than MRD monitoring in the adjuvant setting.\n- Caveats: Optimal monitoring intervals for TNBC specifically have not been established, and early detection of molecular relapse has not been proven to improve survival outcomes when additional interventions are limited.\n\nOPTION C: Consider additional systemic therapy options\n- Evidence: The current sources focus primarily on metastatic breast cancer biomarker testing [1,2,5,6] rather than MRD-positive early-stage disease. For this TNBC patient who has already received standard neoadjuvant therapy and CREATE-X capecitabine, evidence-based options beyond clinical trials are limited.\n- Caveats: ESMO guidelines classify MRD as investigational for treatment decisions, and no completed randomized trials have demonstrated survival benefit from MRD-guided therapy escalation in breast cancer [4].\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: There are no completed randomized controlled trials using MRD as a selection biomarker for breast cancer treatment escalation.

Current guidelines do not provide specific recommendations for MRD-guided treatment decisions in this setting.\n\nOPTION B: Intensify surveillance with imaging and serial ctDNA monitoring.\n- Evidence: The indexed evidence does not specifically address optimal monitoring intervals for ctDNA surveillance in early-stage breast cancer, though serial monitoring every 3-6 months could track disease kinetics while maintaining standard imaging surveillance. Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether the longitudinal sensitivity for detecting distant recurrence provides sufficient reliability for clinical monitoring. This approach allows time to confirm molecular findings and assess trajectory before committing to systemic therapy.\n- Guidelines: Current NCCN guidelines address ctDNA testing primarily in the metastatic setting for biomarker detection [1,2,3,5,6] but do not provide specific guidance for surveillance MRD positivity in early-stage breast cancer.\n\nOPTION C: Tissue-based confirmation of recurrence.\n- Evidence: NCCN guidelines note that samples with low tumor fraction should be interpreted with caution and suggest additional sampling when tumor fraction is low [5,6]. ESMO consensus classifies ctDNA MRD as a level III (investigational) biomarker for treatment decisions [4]. Tissue biopsy remains the gold standard for confirming recurrent disease and enables comprehensive biomarker testing.\n- Caveats: Tissue confirmation may not be feasible if disease is not radiographically apparent, and biopsy carries procedural risks.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS:\nThere are no breast cancer-specific randomized trials demonstrating survival benefit from acting on isolated ctDNA positivity.
