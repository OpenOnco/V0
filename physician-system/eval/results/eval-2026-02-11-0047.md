## Failures (4)

### Q2 (clinical_scenario, standard) — 4/10

> Stage III rectal cancer patient, completed 3 months of FOLFOX post-surgery. Signatera just came back MRD-negative. Is there evidence to support stopping chemo early rather than completing the planned ...

**LLM Assessment:** Factually safe but clinically incomplete. Appropriately conservative in lacking stage III-specific MRD de-escalation data, yet fails to adequately leverage available evidence (DYNAMIC stage II, IDEA trial for treatment duration, CIRCULATE-Japan data). Reads more directive than consultative. Meets minimum compliance but falls short of optimal decision support for a real clinical dilemma.
**CDS violations:** 1

### Q3 (clinical_scenario, challenging) — 6/10

> 64-year-old, stage II colon cancer, pT4aN0, MSS, no high-risk features besides T4a. Post-surgery Signatera is MRD-positive. Standard guidelines wouldn't call for adjuvant chemo here. What does the MRD...

**LLM Assessment:** Factually problematic response with major risk stratification error and complete omission of pivotal trial evidence (DYNAMIC). While appropriately conservative on guideline adherence, it fails to answer the specific question about what MRD data actually show regarding treatment benefit in this scenario. Completeness severely compromised by absence of trial evidence and quantitative risk data.

### Q4 (clinical_scenario, challenging) — 5/10

> TNBC patient, had neoadjuvant AC-T, partial response, then surgery with residual disease. Post-op Signatera is MRD-positive. She already got capecitabine per CREATE-X. Any ctDNA-guided options beyond ...

**LLM Assessment:** Moderate accuracy with appropriate epistemic humility but significant clinical incompleteness. Response acknowledges evidence gaps honestly but fails to present major treatment options (immunotherapy, specific trials) that should guide post-capecitabine decision-making in MRD-positive TNBC. Source mismatch (metastatic-focused) undermines clinical applicability. Appropriate deferral to clinical judgment present.

### Q5 (clinical_scenario, challenging) — 7/10

> HR+/HER2- breast cancer, stage IIA, had lumpectomy + adjuvant ET. Now 18 months out, surveillance Signatera just turned positive. No imaging findings yet. What does the literature say about lead time ...

**LLM Assessment:** Balanced response that appropriately emphasizes lack of RCT evidence and defers to judgment. However, missing key specific reference (Parsons et al., 8.9 months) that distinguishes this response from adequate to comprehensive. Sourcing from metastatic disease guidelines rather than surveillance-specific evidence reflects genuine evidence gap but should be more explicitly stated. Accuracy is good but not excellent due to vague language around preliminary benefits without citing the specific lead time data.
**CDS violations:** 2
