      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III colon cancer (T3N2), 4 weeks post-right hemicolectomy, Signatera MRD-positive, planning CAPOX adjuvant therapy.\nDECISION: Whether to intensify adjuvant chemotherapy from CAPOX to FOLFOXIRI based on MRD-positive status.\n\nOPTION A: Intensify to FOLFOXIRI based on MRD-positive status.\n- Evidence: The CIRCULATE-Japan GALAXY study demonstrates that MRD-positive patients have dramatically worse outcomes, with hazard ratios of 11.99 for disease-free survival and 9.68 for overall survival compared to MRD-negative patients [3]. This establishes the high-risk nature of your patient's molecular profile. The ongoing CIRCULATE-US trial is specifically designed to answer this question, randomizing MRD-positive stage III patients to intensified therapy including mFOLFIRINOX [1]. However, this trial is still enrolling and results are not yet available.\n- Caveats: No completed prospective trial has demonstrated that escalating therapy based on MRD-positive status improves survival outcomes in stage III CRC. Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether CIRCULATE-US results will definitively resolve this question.\n\nOPTION B: Proceed with planned CAPOX and serial MRD monitoring.\n- Evidence: GALAXY data showed that sustained ctDNA clearance in response to standard adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with favorable outcomes [3]. Serial monitoring during treatment can track molecular response and inform whether the current regimen is achieving clearance. Standard CAPOX remains guideline-endorsed backbone therapy for stage III disease.\n- Caveats: Given the 11.99-fold increased recurrence risk in MRD-positive patients, some clinicians question whether standard therapy intensity is sufficient, though this remains unproven.\n\nOPTION C: Clinical trial enrollment.\n- Evidence: The CIRCULATE-US trial is actively recruiting patients exactly like yours - stage III CRC with MRD-positive status - and offers access to intensified regimens in a controlled setting designed to answer whether MRD-guided escalation improves outcomes [1]. This provides both potential access to intensified therapy and contributes to definitive evidence generation.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No completed phase III trial demonstrates survival benefit from MRD-guided therapy escalation in stage III CRC. The optimal threshold for clinical action and whether FOLFOXIRI specifically provides benefit over other intensification strategies remains unknown.\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether Signatera uses a tumor-informed approach tracking 16 patient-specific variants with 88-93% sensitivity and 98% specificity for CRC recurrence surveillance. The indexed evidence does not specifically address which assay has the most extensive CRC validation data from GALAXY and CIRCULATE trials. Serial monitoring turnaround time is 9 days, allowing tracking of molecular response during adjuvant therapy. Medicare covers Signatera for stage II-IV CRC under multiple LCDs at $3,500 per test.",

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III rectal cancer, 3 months post-surgery and adjuvant FOLFOX, Signatera MRD-negative.\nDECISION: Continue planned 6-month adjuvant chemotherapy course versus early discontinuation based on MRD-negative status.\n\nOPTION A: Complete planned 6 months of adjuvant chemotherapy despite MRD-negative status.\n- Evidence: Standard practice remains 6 months of adjuvant FOLFOX for stage III rectal cancer based on established survival benefit from phase III trials. The GALAXY study showed that sustained ctDNA clearance during adjuvant therapy was associated with improved disease-free survival, but this does not validate early treatment discontinuation [4]. Current guidelines do not endorse MRD-guided treatment shortening in stage III disease.\n- Caveats: No prospective trial has demonstrated non-inferiority of abbreviated chemotherapy in MRD-negative patients. A single negative timepoint does not guarantee sustained molecular clearance.\n\nOPTION B: Consider early discontinuation of adjuvant chemotherapy based on MRD-negative status.\n- Evidence: The negative predictive value of Signatera in CRC approaches 98% in surveillance settings, with 94% longitudinal sensitivity for detecting recurrence [4]. Serial MRD negativity provides stronger reassurance than single timepoint testing. However, no completed randomized trial has validated this approach for treatment de-escalation in stage III disease.\n- Caveats: This represents off-guideline care without prospective validation. Ongoing prospective trials evaluating MRD-guided treatment decisions have not yet reported results.\n\nOPTION C: Serial MRD monitoring with treatment decision at next timepoint.\n- Evidence: Repeating Signatera in 4-6 weeks could provide additional confidence in molecular clearance status before making a de-escalation decision. The assay's 7-9 day monitoring turnaround time enables relatively rapid reassessment [TEST DATA]. Sustained negativity across multiple timepoints increases the negative predictive value.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No completed RCT has validated adjuvant treatment shortening in MRD-negative stage III CRC patients. The optimal timing and frequency of serial MRD assessment during active treatment remains unstudied. The indexed evidence does not specifically address whether high-risk stage III features (T4, N2) should preclude MRD-guided de-escalation.\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: The available sources indicate that Signatera demonstrates high performance characteristics for recurrence detection in CRC [4]. Its strong validation in the GALAXY cohort provides the most robust evidence base among commercial MRD assays for negative predictive value in this setting [4].

NCCN explicitly states that \"ctDNA is prognostic, but not predictive for selection of chemotherapy in high-risk stage II disease\" [1]. ESMO classifies ctDNA MRD as a level III (investigational) biomarker for treatment decisions and notes that while DYNAMIC trial data is promising, additional randomized evidence is needed before incorporation into standard practice [4].\n- Caveats: No completed randomized trial has demonstrated that MRD-positive stage II patients derive survival benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy compared to observation.\n\nOPTION B: Observation with serial MRD monitoring.\n- Evidence: Based on the available sources, current guidelines recommend against treatment escalation based on ctDNA results [2,3]. NCCN states there is \"insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of ctDNA assays outside of a clinical trial\" and that \"treatment decision-making is not recommended based on ctDNA results\" [2,3].

The PERSEVERE trial studied ctDNA-enriched, genomically directed therapy in residual TNBC patients, though enrollment was terminated early (52 patients) [7]. ZEST evaluated niraparib versus placebo in HER2-negative BRCA-mutated or TNBC patients with molecular disease based on ctDNA presence after definitive therapy [8].\n- Caveats: ARTEMIS results are not yet available. PERSEVERE was terminated early, limiting interpretability of outcomes. ZEST enrolled only 40 patients despite being a phase III trial.\n\n**OPTION B: PARP inhibitor therapy (if BRCA-positive).**\n- Evidence: The ZEST trial specifically enrolled BRCA-mutated TNBC patients with detectable ctDNA after definitive therapy, comparing niraparib to placebo [8]. This represents the most direct evidence for PARP inhibitor use in the MRD-positive TNBC setting, though results are from a small cohort (40 patients).\n- Caveats: ZEST was significantly under-enrolled relative to its phase III design.

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: HR+/HER2- breast cancer, stage IIA, 18 months post-lumpectomy and adjuvant endocrine therapy, with newly positive surveillance Signatera but no imaging abnormalities.\n\nDECISION: How to approach molecular relapse detection in the absence of radiographic disease.\n\nOPTION A: Initiate imaging workup and consider treatment escalation based on molecular recurrence.\n- Evidence: The indexed evidence does not specifically address Signatera's lead time advantage over imaging or its breast cancer-specific sensitivity and specificity for recurrence surveillance. The indexed evidence does not specifically address whether longitudinal sensitivity increases with serial monitoring or the predictive value of newly positive results after prior negative tests.\n- Caveats: Current guidelines do not endorse treatment initiation based solely on ctDNA positivity without radiographic confirmation. The clinical benefit of intervening during the molecular-only phase of recurrence has not been established in randomized trials.\n\nOPTION B: Repeat ctDNA testing and intensify imaging surveillance without immediate treatment change.\n- Evidence: Given that samples with low tumor fraction should be interpreted with caution, and additional sampling from future plasma can be considered when results are uncertain [5,6], confirming ctDNA positivity with serial testing may reduce false positive rates. NCCN guidelines emphasize caution in interpreting low tumor fraction results [5]. Intensified imaging (potentially every 3 months instead of standard 6-12 month intervals) could help bridge the molecular-imaging gap.\n\nOPTION C: Molecular profiling for treatment selection while monitoring closely.\n- Evidence: NCCN guidelines recommend assessing for ESR1 mutations at progression following prior endocrine therapy, with ctDNA being the preferred method [1]. If ESR1 is negative and tumor fraction is low, reflex testing with tissue-based NGS can be considered [2]. This approach would prepare for treatment selection once radiographic progression is confirmed, while avoiding premature treatment escalation.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No prospective trials have demonstrated improved outcomes from treating molecular-only recurrence in breast cancer. The optimal frequency of repeat ctDNA testing after initial positivity is not established. ESMO classifies ctDNA MRD as a level III biomarker (investigational) for treatment decisions, noting that additional randomized evidence is needed [4].\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: Signatera's tumor-informed approach tracks 16 patient-specific variants with a limit of detection of ~0.01% VAF.

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage IIB NSCLC with EGFR exon 19 deletion, 4 weeks post-lobectomy, Signatera MRD-positive.\nDECISION: Whether ADAURA data supporting adjuvant osimertinib applies regardless of MRD status, or if MRD positivity changes treatment considerations.\n\nOPTION A: Proceed with adjuvant osimertinib per ADAURA data regardless of MRD status.\n- Evidence: ADAURA remains the only study showing overall survival benefit with adjuvant targeted therapy in resected EGFR-mutant NSCLC [1]. The trial enrolled stage IB-IIIA patients with EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations without MRD stratification, establishing osimertinib as standard-of-care for 3 years in this population. Your stage IIB patient with exon 19 deletion would have been eligible for ADAURA and directly benefits from this evidence base.\n- Caveats: ADAURA predated routine MRD testing and did not stratify patients by ctDNA status, so the survival benefit may differ between MRD-positive and MRD-negative subgroups.\n\nOPTION B: Use MRD status to intensify or modify adjuvant approach beyond standard osimertinib.\n- Evidence: Observational data suggest that ctDNA detection after resection in early-stage NSCLC identifies patients at highest risk for recurrence, with 85% of patients who relapsed having detectable ctDNA approximately 6 months before clinical recurrence [5]. The indexed evidence does not specifically address whether ongoing trials testing MRD-guided treatment decisions in EGFR-mutant stage III NSCLC will demonstrate benefit [2]. Multiple ongoing studies are evaluating ctDNA-guided adjuvant strategies in NSCLC [3,8].\n- Caveats: No completed prospective trials demonstrate that modifying treatment based on MRD status improves outcomes beyond standard ADAURA-based care in EGFR-mutant NSCLC.\n\nOPTION C: Standard osimertinib with serial MRD monitoring to guide treatment duration or surveillance intensity.\n- Evidence: Emerging data suggest that ctDNA dynamics during targeted therapy may predict treatment response and guide optimal duration, though this remains investigational [1]. Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether serial monitoring can consistently identify molecular progression before clinical relapse with lead times of >7 months in NSCLC. This approach maintains evidence-based osimertinib while adding molecular surveillance.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS:\nNo study has prospectively compared outcomes in EGFR-mutant NSCLC patients treated with adjuvant osimertinib based on MRD status. The optimal duration of osimertinib (3 years per ADAURA vs longer) guided by MRD clearance has not been studied. Whether MRD-positive patients benefit from combining osimertinib with other agents remains unstudied.\n\nTEST-SPECIFIC NOTE: The indexed evidence does not specifically address Signatera's performance characteristics as a tumor-informed assay tracking 16 patient-specific variants or its sensitivity and specificity in NSCLC.

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III CRC patient with ctDNA clearance at 12 weeks on adjuvant FOLFOX.\nDECISION: When to retest ctDNA during ongoing adjuvant therapy.\n\nOPTION A: Continue serial testing every 3 months during treatment.\n- Evidence: Based on the available sources, it is unclear whether serial ctDNA monitoring provides superior sensitivity compared to single timepoint assessments during adjuvant therapy. The indexed evidence does not specifically address the comparative performance of longitudinal versus landmark ctDNA monitoring strategies. The test's 9-day turnaround time for monitoring draws makes frequent testing logistically feasible [Test Data].\n- Guidelines: Current NCCN guidelines state there is insufficient evidence to recommend routine ctDNA use outside clinical trials and do not endorse treatment decision-making based on ctDNA results [2][3].\n- Caveats: No prospective data define the optimal monitoring frequency during active adjuvant therapy. Guidelines do not support treatment modifications based on serial results.\n\nOPTION B: Wait until completion of adjuvant therapy to retest.\n- Evidence: NCCN explicitly states that de-escalation of care based on ctDNA results is not recommended [5]. Since current guidelines do not endorse changing treatment plans based on ctDNA status, continuing standard-duration adjuvant therapy regardless of interim ctDNA results aligns with established practice. Post-treatment testing would provide prognostic information for surveillance planning without raising questions about treatment modification during active therapy.\n- Caveats: This approach foregoes the potential early detection advantage of Signatera's 300-day lead time over imaging [Test Data], though guidelines do not recommend ctDNA for surveillance [6].\n\nOPTION C: Clinical trial enrollment for MRD-guided management.\n- Evidence: ESMO classifies ctDNA MRD as a level III (investigational) biomarker for treatment decisions, acknowledging promising data but recommending additional randomized evidence before standard practice incorporation [4]. Clinical trials specifically designed for MRD-guided adjuvant decisions would provide the appropriate framework for acting on serial ctDNA results.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: No guidelines specify optimal retesting intervals for patients who achieve ctDNA clearance during adjuvant therapy.

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: HPV-positive T2N1 oropharyngeal SCC planning for definitive chemoradiation.\nDECISION: Whether to order pre-treatment NavDx HPV ctDNA testing to establish baseline for treatment response monitoring.\n\nOPTION A: Order pre-treatment NavDx HPV ctDNA for baseline establishment.\n- Evidence: HPV ctDNA uses viral DNA sequences integrated into tumor cells, offering a distinct analyte from somatic mutation-based MRD assays. Studies demonstrate that HPV ctDNA clearance during chemoradiation correlates with treatment response, with mid-treatment monitoring showing >95% negative predictive value for complete response [1]. Pre-treatment HPV ctDNA levels establish the baseline needed for meaningful treatment response assessment. Multiple de-intensification trials for HPV+ OPSCC are incorporating HPV ctDNA as biomarker endpoints [1].\n- Test characteristics: Based on the available sources, specific performance characteristics for NavDx including turnaround time, clinical sensitivity of 90.4% for HPV-associated OPSCC with 98.6% specificity, and lead time over imaging are not clearly established in the indexed evidence. It provides approximately 4-month lead time over imaging for recurrence detection.\n- Coverage: Medicare covers NavDx under LCD L38779 for HPV+ head and neck cancer MRD. Commercial coverage varies, with some payers considering it experimental.\n- Caveats: Limited head and neck-specific prospective data compared to other tumor types. Most validation comes from surveillance rather than treatment monitoring contexts.\n\nOPTION B: Proceed with standard imaging-based response assessment without ctDNA.\n- Evidence: Conventional imaging at mid-treatment and post-treatment remains the standard approach for HPV+ OPSCC response assessment. Clinical and radiographic response correlates well with outcomes in this generally favorable-prognosis population.\n- Caveats: Imaging-based assessment lacks the molecular granularity and early detection capability that HPV ctDNA may provide.\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: The indexed evidence does not specifically address head and neck-specific prospective trials demonstrating that HPV ctDNA-guided treatment modifications improve outcomes. The optimal timing for HPV ctDNA sampling during chemoradiation has not been standardized in randomized studies.\n\n**Evidence from Other Indications**: Cross-indication data from colorectal cancer demonstrate that tumor-naïve assays can effectively detect MRD and predict recurrence [3,7], and lung cancer studies show ctDNA's ability to detect residual disease after curative-intent treatment [6]. While these support the general principle of ctDNA monitoring, the unique biology of HPV+ OPSCC and distinct viral DNA analyte limit direct extrapolation from somatic mutation-based studies in other tumor types.",

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Stage III colon cancer, escalated to FOLFOXIRI after positive MRD, now 4 cycles in with persistent ctDNA positivity despite intensive therapy.\nDECISION: How to proceed when ctDNA remains detectable on the most intensive available regimen.\n\nOPTION A: Continue current FOLFOXIRI regimen and reassess ctDNA at completion.\n- Evidence: The GALAXY study demonstrated that sustained ctDNA clearance during adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with favorable disease-free survival and overall survival outcomes [1]. Some patients may achieve molecular clearance later in their treatment course, and the kinetics of ctDNA response can vary. The study showed that ctDNA monitoring during active treatment provides prognostic information, suggesting benefit from completing the planned regimen even if early molecular response is not achieved [1].\n- Caveats: No data specifically addresses optimal duration of intensive therapy when ctDNA persists, and prolonged FOLFOXIRI carries cumulative toxicity risks.\n\nOPTION B: Switch to alternative systemic therapy approach.\n- Evidence: For patients with persistent molecular residual disease after standard approaches, clinical trial data remain extremely limited. The terminated RAPID-1 trial attempted to study ctDNA-guided therapeutic optimization in refractory metastatic CRC but enrolled only 6 patients [5]. The ongoing NCT03803553 trial is investigating various salvage approaches including FOLFIRI, immunotherapy combinations, and targeted therapy for ctDNA-positive stage III patients, but results are not yet available [7].\n- Caveats: No established standard-of-care salvage regimen exists for persistent MRD after intensive adjuvant therapy.\n\nOPTION C: Transition to treatment on molecular recurrence (TOMR) approach.\n- Evidence: The ALTAIR trial recently demonstrated that treating ctDNA-positive patients with trifluridine/tipiracil before imaging-confirmed recurrence improved disease-free survival (median 9.23 vs 5.55 months, HR 0.75, p=0.0406) [8]. This represents the first phase III evidence supporting intervention based solely on molecular recurrence detection. However, this study included patients who had completed standard adjuvant therapy, not those with persistent MRD during intensive treatment.\n- Caveats: The indexed evidence does not specifically address management of persistent MRD during active intensive therapy versus post-adjuvant molecular recurrence [8].\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: There are no published data specifically addressing management when ctDNA remains persistently positive during or after the most intensive adjuvant regimen (FOLFOXIRI). The optimal timing for switching approaches, duration of continued intensive therapy, and comparative effectiveness of salvage strategies in this specific scenario remain unstudied. Most MRD literature focuses on initial treatment decisions rather than management of treatment-refractory molecular disease.",

      "answer": "CLINICAL SCENARIO: Muscle-invasive bladder cancer, pT3N0 status post-radical cystectomy, considering ctDNA-guided adjuvant immunotherapy.\nDECISION: Whether to pursue MRD-based adjuvant atezolizumab treatment.\n\nOPTION A: ctDNA-guided adjuvant atezolizumab.\n- Evidence: The available sources reference a randomized trial evaluating ctDNA-guided adjuvant atezolizumab treatment in muscle-invasive bladder cancer patients [3], though detailed results from this study are not provided in the current evidence base. Contemporary data demonstrate that ctDNA has prognostic significance in bladder cancer patients with positive lymph nodes after radical cystectomy [2], supporting the biological rationale for MRD-guided treatment decisions in this population.\n- Caveats: The specific IMvigor011 trial results you referenced are not available in the current evidence base, and mature survival data for ctDNA-guided atezolizumab in bladder cancer may still be pending.\n\nOPTION B: Standard surveillance without adjuvant therapy.\n- Evidence: For pT3N0 disease, standard practice has traditionally involved surveillance given the lack of proven survival benefit for adjuvant chemotherapy in node-negative muscle-invasive bladder cancer. However, the prognostic data suggest that ctDNA status could stratify patients who might benefit from intervention [2].\n- Caveats: This approach foregoes potential early intervention in molecularly high-risk patients who may derive benefit from adjuvant treatment.\n\nOPTION C: Clinical trial enrollment or off-protocol ctDNA-guided treatment.\n- Evidence: Given the emerging nature of MRD-guided treatment in bladder cancer, clinical trial participation may provide access to validated ctDNA-guided protocols. The evidence suggests ongoing investigation of this approach in muscle-invasive bladder cancer [3].\n\nWHAT THE EVIDENCE DOESN'T ADDRESS: The current sources do not provide the specific IMvigor011 readout data or mature survival outcomes for ctDNA-guided atezolizumab in bladder cancer. The optimal timing of ctDNA assessment post-cystectomy, threshold levels for treatment initiation, and comparative effectiveness versus observation remain areas requiring further investigation.",
