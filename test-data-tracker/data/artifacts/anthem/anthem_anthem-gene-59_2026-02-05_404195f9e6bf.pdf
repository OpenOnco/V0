Description/Scope
This document addresses hybrid personalized molecular residual disease (MRD) testing for oncologic disease
management. This personalized testing occurs in a two-step process. The first step involves whole exome sequencing
(WES) of the tumor tissue. In the second step,  information about the tumor learned from the WES is used to develop a
personalized assay to to detect circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) that assesses MRD. Commercially available personalized
MRD tests include the Signatera™ test (Natera Inc., San Carlos, CA) and the RaDaR™ test (Inivata, Research Triangle
Park, NC).

Position Statement
Investigational and Not Medically Necessary:
Oncologic hybrid personalized molecular residual disease (MRD) tests are considered investigational and not medically
necessary for all indications.
Rationale
There are no randomized controlled trials or non-randomized comparative studies comparing health outcomes in
individuals who are managed with versus without hybrid personalized MRD testing.
In 2019, Reinert and colleagues published a prospective study that included 130 individuals with stage I-III CRC. The
Signatera test was used as the ctDNA detection technique. Plasma samples were collected before surgery and 30 days (±
14 days) after surgery, and tumor tissue samples were collected at surgery. Post-surgical plasma samples collected at 30
days, before starting adjuvant chemotherapy, were available for 90 individuals. Of these, 84 (89.4%) were negative on the
Signatera test and 10 (10.6%) were positive. Those who tested positive had a significantly higher recurrence rate (7 of 10
individuals, 70%) than those who tested negative (10 of 84 individuals, 11.9%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 6.3% to
20.1%). A total of 75 individuals had serial Signatera testing after definitive treatment. Fourteen of 15 individuals who
tested positive (93.3%) experienced disease recurrence compared with 2 of the 60 (3.3%) who tested negative. Test
positivity was significantly associated with lower relapse-free survival (RFS) (hazard ratio [HR], 43.5, 95% CI, 9.8 to 193.5,
p<0.001).
Several studies evaluating the Signatera personalized hybrid MRD test were published in 2021. Loupakis and colleagues
(2021) reported on 136 individuals enrolled with metastatic CRC, of which 113 individuals underwent surgery with curative
intent. Signatera assays were designed for 112 individuals and used to assess MRD. Plasma collected a median of 27
days after surgery (and before the start of postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy) in the 112 individuals found that 61
(54.5%) were MRD-positive and 51 (45.5%) were MRD-negative. A positive MRD status was associated with a statistically
significant reduction in disease-free survival (DFS), compared with MRD-negative individuals (HR, 5.8; 95% CI, 3.5 to 9.7;
p<0.001). MRD-positive individuals also had a significantly lower overall survival (OS) rate than MRD-negative individuals
Feedback

(HR, 16.0; 95% CI, 3.9 to 68.0; p<0.001). In a multivariate analysis, MRD status was the most significant factor associated
with disease-free survival (HR, 5.78; 95% CI, 2.24 to 10.0; p<0.001).
Zhang and colleagues (2021) published a retrospective chart review reporting on 198 individuals with Stage I-IV
gastrointestinal malignancy; 46% had colon, rectum or anal cancer and 182 (92%) underwent surgery. The Signatera test
was used for detection and quantification of ctDNA. Plasma samples used for test development were collected at least 4
weeks after surgery. In a cross-sectional analysis, the investigators found a statistically significant association between
ctDNA (Signatera) test positivity and advanced stage of cancer. About 20% of postoperative samples from stage I-III
tumors tested positive, the rate for stage IV cancers was 44%, p=0.0004. There was also a statistically significant
association between Signatera test positivity and the the presence of and extent of metastases. Plasma samples from
distant metastases had a test positivity rate of 42% compared with a rate of 22% for non-metastatic tumors, p=0.00003.
Kasi and colleagues (2021) published a protocol for a prospective, single-arm, observational study (BESPOKE) that will be
following 200 individuals with colorectal cancer for up to 2 years. The protocol includes serial testing with the Signatera
test. The study does not include a comparison group that is managed without use of the Signatera test. Findings of this
study are not yet available. According to the ClinicalTrials.Gov website (2022), estimated completion date of the
BESPOKE study (NCT04264702) is January 2025.
No studies evaluating the clinical validity or clinical utility of the RaDaR test were identified.
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) colon cancer guideline (V3. 2021) and the European Society for
Medical Oncology (ESMO) clinical practice guideline localized colon cancer (2020) do not address the Signatera or
RaDaR tests, or MRD testing for individuals with colon cancer.
Background/Overview
According to the American Cancer Society (ACS, 2022a), in 2022, there will be approximately 1.9 million new cancer
diagnoses and 609,360 cancer-related deaths in the United States. Of the new cancer diagnoses, approximately 343,000
will be digestive system cancers ,including 151,000 colon and rectal cancers. Additionally, there will be an estimated
290,000 breast cancer and 99,780 melanomaa diagnoses.
Determining the cancer stage is important for devising optimal treatment recommendation and assessing cancer
prognosis. Cancer stage for most cancers is based on the size of the primary tumor and whether the cancer remains
confined to the layer of cells where it began growing, or has spread to nearby lymph nodes or to other areas of the body.
Most cancers can be categorized as having four stages (stages I-IV) and some cancers also have a fifth stage, stage 0.
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2022), describes the stages as follows:
Stage 0. This stage describes cancer in situ. In situ means "in place." Stage 0 cancers are still located in the place
they started. They have not spread to nearby tissues. This stage of cancer is often curable. Surgery can usually
remove the entire tumor. 
Stage I. This stage is usually a cancer that has not grown deeply into nearby tissues. It also has not spread to the
lymph nodes or other parts of the body. It is often called early-stage cancer. 
Stage II and Stage III. In general, these 2 stages are cancers that have grown more deeply into nearby tissue.
They may have also spread to lymph nodes but not to other parts of the body. 
Stage IV. This stage means that the cancer has spread to other organs or parts of the body. It may be also called
advanced or metastatic cancer.
In addition to the stages classification of tumors, the TNM staging system maintained by the American Joint Committee on
Cancer (AJCC) and the Union for International Cancer Control (UICC) is widely used (ASCO, 2022). The TNM system
determines overall stage of the cancer by describing three factors; the size, location and local spread of the primary tumor
(T), the extent of spread to nearby lymph nodes (N) and extent of distant metastases (M).
The current cancer classification systems have limitations in that not all individuals in a particular classification category
benefit from a similar treatment protocol. For example, in colorectal cancer, surgery is generally recommended for stage II
cancers. However, individuals with stage II disease that is at high risk for recurrence may also benefit from adjuvant
chemotherapy. As the NCCN (2021) notes, though, “the current definition of high-risk stage II colon cancer is clearly
inadequate, because many patients with high-risk features do not have a recurrence while some patients deemed to be
Feedback

average-risk do.” The NCCN recommends that factors other than stage, such as age and microsatellite instability, also
need to be taken into consideration when deciding whether or not to recommend adjuvant treatment. The NCCN does not
currently recommend use of other decision-making tools, such as multigene assays. Surveillance methods recommended
by the NCCN to monitor recurrence, in individuals with stage II or III colon cancer include regular history-taking and
physical examinations, chest/adominal/pelvic computed tomography (CT), colonoscopy and serial carcinoembryonic
antigen (CEA) monitoring.
MRD testing may be another tool that is useful for detecting disease recurrence or aiding in treatment decisions. MRD
refers to the small number of cancer cells that remain in the body after treatment; these cells are undetectable by standard
testing (Larribère, 2021).
Several hybrid personalized MRD tests for oncologic disease management have been developed. The Signatera test is a
personalized MRD test developed by Natera (San Carlos, CA). The first step of the personalized testing involves one-time
WES of a tumor tissue sample and normal tissue in an individual previously diagnosed with cancer. Comparting the two
samples, a genetic “signature” of the individuals’ tumor can be identified. In the second step of the process, the
personalized information about the genetic ‘signature’ is used in the design of a ‘tumor informed’ assay to detect ctDNA
that assesses MRD. Natera currently markets the Signatera test for individuals who were previously diagnosed with
colorectal cancer to detect residual disease, identify disease recurrence, and to monitor individuals who are being treated
with immunotherapy. It is also marketed for individuals with several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian or lung
cancer or melanoma, to identify residual disease and monitor disease recurrence.
The RaDaR is a personalized MRD test developed by Inivata (Research Triangle Park, NC). The two-step process first
involves WES testing performed on an individual’s tumor sample to identify genetic variations specific to that individual. In
the second step, a next-generation sequencing (NGS) assay panel is designed that is customized to the individual’s
identified tumor profile. The resulting blood test is designed to to track up to 48 genetic variants. The RaDaR test is
intended to be used with multiple tumor types to detect residual disease and recurrence.
Definitions
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): Small portions of nucleic acid that are not associated with cells or cell fragments.
Molecular residual disease (MRD): The cancer cells that may remain in the body during or following treatment. These cells
are present at levels undetectable by traditional microscopic (morphologic) examination of blood, bone marrow or a lymph
node biopsy.
Whole-exome sequencing (WES): Sequencing that reads only the parts of the human genome that encode proteins,
leaving the other regions of the genome unread.
