Clinical Indications 
 
Medically Necessary: 
 
A. Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility (See Table A below) 
Gene mutation testing for cancer susceptibility is considered medically necessary when all of the following 
criteria are met: 
1. The genetic disorder is associated with a potentially significant cancer; and 
2. The risk of the significant cancer associated with the genetic disorder cannot be identified through 
biochemical or other testing; and 
3. A specific mutation, or set of mutations, has been established in the scientific literature to be reliably 
associated with the risk of developing malignancy; and 
4. The results of the genetic test may impact the medical management (for example, surveillance; life-style) of 
the individual; and 
5. Genetic counseling, which encompasses all of the following components, has been performed: 
a. Interpretation of family and medical histories to assess the probability of disease occurrence or 
recurrence; and 
b. Education about inheritance, genetic testing, disease management, prevention and resources; and 
c. Counseling to promote informed choices and adaptation to the risk or presence of a genetic condition; 
and 
d. Counseling for the psychological aspects of genetic testing. 
 
B. Gene Mutation Testing to Guide Targeted Cancer Therapy (See Table B below) 
Gene mutation testing to identify individuals who may benefit from the use of a targeted cancer therapy 
(associated therapeutic product [ATP]) is considered medically necessary when all of the following criteria are 
met: 
1. The individual is a candidate for targeted therapy using an ATP (for example, pharmaceutical or biologic 
treatment) and the mutation status of a specific gene is required prior to initiating treatment with the ATP; 
and  
2. A specific mutation, or set of mutations, has been established in the scientific literature to identify those 
most likely to respond to a targeted therapy or ATP.  
 
C. Circulating Tumor DNA (Liquid Biopsy) (See Table C below) 
Use of a circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) test is considered medically necessary to guide targeted cancer 
therapies in individuals with solid tumors when the mutation(s) meets criteria “B” above and when formalin-
fixed paraffin-embedded tumor tissue (FFPET) is inadequate in quality or quantity or is unavailable for testing.  
 
Note: For information on circulating tumor DNA panel testing (defined by five or more genes or gene variants 
tested on the same day on the same member by the same rendering provider), see GENE.00052 Whole Genome 
Sequencing, Whole Exome Sequencing, Gene Panels, and Molecular Profiling or GENE.00049 Circulating 
Tumor DNA Panel Testing for Cancer (Liquid Biopsy).

Discussion/General Information 
 
A. Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility in Individuals with Cancer (See Table A below) 
 
Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility is used to predict an individual’s risk of cancer development in the 
future and to identify carriers (individuals who do not have the cancer but have a copy of a genetic variant 
which has been associated with the development of cancer). It has been estimated that approximately 5-10% of 
all cancers are considered to be hereditary (the result of inherited genetic susceptibility). 
 
Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility (a form of predictive genetic testing) is generally carried out in 
asymptomatic individuals who are considered to be at high risk for developing cancer due to a strong family 
medical history of the disease, or other factors. Predictive genetic testing can be further divided into two 
categories: presymptomatic and predispositional. Presymptomatic predictive genetic testing confirms or denies 
the development of the disease in those at risk as the condition's genetic variant is highly penetrant and there is 
little or no variable expression. Predispositional predictive genetic tests provide information about an 
individual's risk of developing a specific disorder in the future. Predispositional predictive genetic testing is 
generally carried out for incompletely penetrant conditions and the results are not indicative of the inevitable 
occurrence of a condition or disease, nor are they a guarantee that a disease will not develop in the future.  
 
One of the limitations of predictive genetic testing is the challenge in interpreting positive test results. Some 
individuals who test positive for a disease-associated variant may never develop the disease. In order to be 
useful in the clinical setting, the results of predictive genetic testing should have a high positive predictive 
value (PPV) and evidence should demonstrate that such results improve either disease prevention or 
management, as compared with care without genetic testing. Please refer to CG-GENE-13 Genetic Testing for 
Inherited Diseases for more information on the specific types of genetic tests, including but not limited to 
predictive genetic testing. 
 
A position statement published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) indicates that genetic 
testing for cancer susceptibility is appropriate when the: 
 
1) Individual has personal or family history features suggestive of a genetic cancer susceptibility 
condition, 2) the genetic test can be adequately interpreted, and 3) the test results will aid in diagnosis 
or influence the medical or surgical management of the patient or family members at hereditary risk 
of cancer (ASCO, 2003).

Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and

ASCO also recommends that genetic testing only be provided in the setting of pre- and post-test counseling, 
which should include a discussion of the risks and benefits of cancer early detection and prevention modalities 
(ASCO, 2003). 
 
In assessing the value of a specific genetic test for susceptibility to a particular malignant condition, 
consideration should be given to the peer-reviewed, published literature addressing the analytical validity, 
clinical validity, and clinical utility of the test. Each genetic test must be carefully evaluated to determine 
whether or not the identified variant reliably identifies a specific type of cancer, and that the results of the 
genetic test, whether affirmative or negative, will impact the clinical management of the individual (for 
example, guide treatment decisions, surveillance recommendations or preventive strategies). The results of 
genetic testing are also expected to improve net health outcomes, (that is, the anticipated health benefits of the 
interventions outweigh any harmful effects [medical or psychological] of the intervention). 
 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Networks (NCCN) guidelines do not contain recommendations for the 
general strategy of testing a tumor for a wide range of biomarkers. However, the guidelines do contain 
recommendations for specific genetic testing for individual cancers, when there is a known drug-biomarker 
combination that has demonstrated benefits for that particular type of tumor, such as non-small cell lung cancer 
(NCCN NSCLC).  
 
Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia Type 2 (MEN 2) and Thyroid Cancer 
 
Thyroid cancer (carcinoma) is relatively uncommon. In the United States, the lifetime risk of being diagnosed 
with thyroid cancer is approximately 1%. An estimated 44,280 cases of newly diagnosed thyroid cancer are 
expected in the United States in 2021 (National Cancer Institute [NCI]). 
 
Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN 2) is a genetic condition which can be passed from generation to 
generation in a family. The gene associated with MEN 2 is called RET (RET proto-oncogene). A mutation in 
the RET gene increases an individual’s risk of developing medullary thyroid cancer and other tumors 
associated with MEN 2. 
 
Three major types of tumors are associated with MEN 2: medullary thyroid cancer, parathyroid tumors, and 
pheochromocytoma. MEN 2 is classified into three subtypes based on clinical features: MEN 2A, which affects 
60% to 90% of MEN 2 families; MEN 2B, which affects 5% of MEN 2 families; and FMTC, which affects 5% 
to 35% of MEN 2 families (ASCO, 2013). The most common sign of multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 is 
medullary thyroid cancer. 
 
Based on histological findings, thyroid cancer includes the following categories: (1) differentiated (follicular, 
papillary and Hurthle); (2) medullary; and (3) anaplastic (aggressive undifferentiated tumor). Medullary thyroid 
cancer (MTC) develops from the “C” or parafollicular cells of the thyroid gland which produce calcitonin. 
Approximately 80% of the cases of MTC are sporadic. The remaining inherited syndromes include multiple 
endocrine neoplasia (MEN) type 2A (also known as MEN 2A), MEN 2B and familial MTC (FMTC). All three

of these subtypes, MEN 2A, MEN 2B and FMTC are inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern and involve 
an elevated risk for the development of medullary carcinoma of the thyroid. MEN 2A and MEN 2B have an 
increased risk for the development of pheochromocytoma. MEN 2A has an elevated risk for parathyroid 
adenoma or hyperplasia. Additional features in MEN 2B include distinctive facies with enlarged lips, mucosal 
neuromas of the lips and tongue and ganglioneuromatosis of the gastrointestinal tract. MTC generally occurs in 
early childhood in MEN 2B, early adulthood in MEN 2A, and middle age in FMTC (Moline, 2013). 
 
Mutations in the RET proto-oncogene are found in at least 95% of individuals with MEN 2A and 88% of 
FMTC. Mutations associated with MEN 2A and familial MTC have been most frequently identified in several 
codons of the extracellular domains of exon 10, 11 and 13, while MEN 2B and some FMTC mutation have 
been identified within the intracellular exons 14 to 16. Somatic mutations in exons 11, 13 and 16 have also 
been identified in at least 25% of sporadic MTC tumors. Approximately 6% of individuals with clinical 
sporadic MTC are carriers of a RET germline mutation (National Comprehensive Cancer Network® [NCCN], 
2021). 
 
The management of MEN 2 depends on the type of MEN 2 diagnosed and whether the condition was identified 
prior to clinical signs and symptoms. If treated prior to regional lymph node metastases, MEN2 can usually be 
cured surgically. However, the majority of individuals (up to 75%) have lymph node involvement at the time of 
diagnosis. Because the development of invasive MTC is usually preceded by C-cell hyperplasia and can be 
detected by the oversecretion of calcitonin in response to a chemical challenge, annual surveillance employing 
biochemical testing has been used to monitor those with inherited disease before it progresses beyond the 
earliest stages. Genetic assays for RET mutations may be utilized as an alternative to annual biochemical 
testing for C-cell hyperplasia in individuals with a known family history of MEN 2A, 2B, or FMTC. Annual 
biochemical screening can be discontinued in those individuals who test negative for RET mutations. 
Individuals who test positive for RET mutations may elect to undergo immediate thyroidectomy or defer 
thyroidectomy until biochemical tests suggest the development of MTC. Genetic assays for RET oncogene 
mutations have also been used to determine if new cases of MTC without a known family history are truly 
sporadic in origin. Positive test results in this setting may prompt the evaluation of family members or initiate 
screening for pheochromocytoma. 
 
The American Thyroid Association (ATA) developed four MTC risk levels based on correlations between RET 
genotype and MEN 2 phenotype, and made specific recommendations regarding the ideal timing for 
prophylactic thyroidectomy (ATA, 2015). For individuals with RET variants associated with MEN 2B, who 
have the highest risk for early-onset MTC, thyroidectomy is recommended within the first year of life. For 
individuals at the next highest risk level (i.e., those with variants involving RET codon 634), thyroidectomy is 
recommended in the first 5 years of life. For individuals with genotypes at the third highest level of risk, 
thyroidectomy should be considered prior to the age of 5 years, but may be delayed if stringent clinical criteria 
are met. For individuals with genotypes in the lowest risk category, thyroidectomy may be delayed after age 5 
in the context of normal screening results and a family history consistent with less aggressive MTC.

According to the recommendations set forth in the guidelines by the NCCN (NCCN, 2021), genetic testing for 
RET-proto-oncogene mutations is recommended for all newly diagnosed individuals with clinically apparent 
sporadic MTC, and for screening children and adults in known relatives with inherited forms of MTC. 
 
In summary, there is adequate data to show that genetic tests for point mutation in the RET gene can identify 
those with an inherited susceptibility for MTC prior to the onset of clinical manifestations. Test results affect 
individual management by prompting age-appropriate prophylactic thyroidectomy, the early diagnosis and 
treatment of pheochromocytoma and/or hyperparathyroidism, continued biochemical monitoring in affected 
individuals, and by prompting discontinuation of monitoring in individuals who test negative. 
 
PTEN Hamartoma Tumor Syndrome 
 
Germline mutations in PTEN have been identified in a variety of rare syndromic manifestations that are 
collectively known as PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome (PHTS). The defining clinical feature of PHTS is the 
presence of hamartomatous tumors, benign tumors resulting from an overgrowth of normal tissue. The 
phenotypic spectrum of PHTS includes Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome 
(BRRS), and adult Lhermitte-Dulcos disease (ALDD). Notably, germline mutations in PTEN are also 
associated with adult Lhermitte-Dulcos disease, autism spectrum disorders with macrocephaly, and possibly 
intellectual disability/developmental delay with macrocephaly. The estimated penetrance of PTEN mutation is 
approximately 80%, although risk estimates vary. 
 
CS is characterized by multiple hamartomas and/or an increased risk of developing cancerous lesions in various 
tissues and organs, including the skin, mucous membranes, breast, thyroid, endometrium and brain. Other 
cancers associated with CS include colorectal cancer, kidney cancer, and possibly melanoma. Additional 
conditions associated with CS include macrocephaly and Lhermitte-Duclos disease. A small percentage of 
affected individuals have delayed development or intellectual disability. The features of CS overlap with those 
of BRRS.  
 
The BRRS variant of Cowden syndrome/PHTS is characterized by the presence of macrocephaly, 
gastrointestinal hamartomatous polyps, multiple lipomas, hemangiomas, developmental delay, and in males, 
pigmented macules of the glans penis. The signs of BRRS that may be present at birth include macrocephaly 
and macrosomia. Developmental delays may present in early childhood. Other signs associated with BRRS 
include pectus excavatum, hypotonia, hyperextensibility of joints, thyroid disorders, seizures and scoliosis.  
 
Adult Lhermitte-Dulcos disease (ALDD, also known as dysplastic gangliocytoma of the cerebellum) is 
characterized by the development of slow-growing, benign hamartomatous outgrowths of the cerebellum. The 
lesions typically arise in the cerebellar hemispheres, most frequently in the left hemisphere. This condition is 
most frequently seen in adults, with the average age at diagnosis of 34 years. Developmental abnormalities 
including macrocephaly and intellectual developmental disorder are common. A presumptive diagnosis of 
PHTS may be made based on clinical findings; however, a definitive diagnosis of PHTS is made when genetic 
testing identifies a germline mutation.

The diagnostic criteria for CS are multifaceted. The NCCN guidelines include testing criteria and clinical 
diagnostic criteria for CS. According to the NCCN guidelines, the CS/PHTS testing algorithm was established 
to assist in determining which individuals are candidates for testing for PTEN pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
variants and can be used to evaluate the need for further risk assessment and genetic testing. The revised 
clinical diagnostic criteria can be used to identify clinical features associated with CS/PHTS. Individuals who 
meet the revised clinical diagnostic criteria for CS/PHTS are candidates for testing for PTEN pathogenic or 
likely pathogenic variants (NCCN Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic, 
2022). 
 
According to the NCCN guidelines, the testing criteria for CS/PHTS are divided into three categories (see 
criteria below). An individual is considered for testing for PTEN pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants based 
on whether he or she meets specific criteria or combinations of criteria from these three categories.  
1. The first category includes any individual with a personal history of BRRS, adult LDD, autism spectrum 
disorder with macrocephaly, or two or more biopsy-proven trichilemmomas. Additionally, individuals with 
a family history positive for the presence of a known PTEN pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant.  
2. The next category represents “major” features which have been associated with CS/PHTS. An individual 
exhibiting at least two of the major criteria where one of these is macrocephaly meets the threshold for 
genetic testing. Similarly, an individual exhibiting three or more of the major criteria without macrocephaly 
or an individual who meets one of the major criteria and three or more of the minor criteria, would also 
meet the genetic testing threshold. If an individual has two or more major criteria but does not have 
macrocephaly, then one of the major criteria may be included as one of the three minor criteria in order to 
meet the testing threshold. Lastly, an individual with a first-degree relative diagnosed with CS/PHTS or 
BRRS for whom testing has not been performed would also fulfill the threshold for PTEN testing if the 
individual meets at least one major criterion and two or more minor criteria. With respect to the presence of 
mucocutaneous lesions, the panel did not consider the published evidence sufficient to specify an exact 
number or extent of these lesions required for the condition to be defined as a major criterion for Cowden 
syndrome. The NCCN panel also felt that evidence from the literature was not sufficient to include 
fibrocystic breast disease, uterine fibroids or fibromas as part of the testing criteria. 
3. The final category of criteria includes features with a “minor” association with CS/PHTS. In order to fulfill 
the genetic testing criteria in this category, an individual would need to meet at least four or more of the 
minor criteria or three or more minor criteria and one of the major criteria.   
 
It is also worth noting that an individual with a first-degree relative diagnosed with CS or BRRS for whom 
testing has not been completed would also meet the PTEN gene mutation testing criteria provided the 
individual meets at least one of the major criteria and two or more of the minor criteria (NCCN 
Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic, 2022). 
 
The testing criteria below provides a summary of NCCN’s testing criteria for CS/PHTS as well as the major and 
minor criteria.

B. Gene Mutation Testing to Guide Targeted Therapy in Individuals with a Malignant Condition (See Table B 
below) 
 
Increased understanding of the human genome has made it possible to identify genomic variation in both 
normal and malignant tissues. Newer therapies may be targeted to specific variants ("targeted biologic 
therapy") and may not have been evaluated in individuals without the specific variant or be considered unlikely 
to benefit individuals without the specific variant.  
 
Examples of targeted therapies include those that: 
• Block specific enzymes and growth factor receptors involved in cancer cell proliferation. These drugs are 
also called signal transduction inhibitors. 
• Modify the function of proteins that regulate gene expression and other cellular functions. 
• Induce cancer cells to undergo apoptosis. 
• Block the growth of blood vessels and blood supply to tumors. 
• Help the immune system to destroy cancer cells. 
 
The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved numerous companion diagnostic devices to detect 
variants in specific genes for the targeted treatment of cancer. Methodologies include, but are not necessarily 
limited to: immunohistochemistry (IHC), real-time or multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR), fluorescence 
in situ hybridization (FISH), and next generation sequencing (NGS). As an example of a targeted cancer 
therapy, in 2017, the FDA approved IDHIFA
®
 (enasidenib) for the treatment of relapsed or refractory acute 
myeloid leukemia (AML). However, the FDA drug label also stipulated that IDHIFA should only be used in 
individuals with an isocitrate dehydrogenase-2 (IDH2) mutation as detected by an FDA approved test. 
 
In some cases, genetic testing, also called molecular characterization, is recommended for risk stratification and 
treatment planning, which affects choice of chemotherapeutic regimen, surveillance considerations, and 
minimal (measurable) disease detection. 
 
Targeted Therapy and Treatment Planning for Leukemias 
 
Leukemia, which is sometimes referred to as a blood cancer, is a type of cancer that affects the blood and bone 
marrow. The disease occurs when blood cells produced in the bone marrow grow out of control Frequently, 
leukemia starts the white blood cells, but some leukemias start in other blood cell types. There are various 
forms of leukemia, which are generally categorized based on whether the leukemia is acute (fast growing) or 
chronic (slower growing), and whether it starts in myeloid cells or lymphoid cells. As an example, acute 
lymphoblastic leukemia (AML) and chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) are both blood and bone marrow cancers 
that affect the same types of white blood cells. While the onset of AML occurs suddenly as very immature cells

quickly crowd out normal cells in the bone marrow, CML has a delayed onset, with the CML cells slowly 
growing out of control. Targeted therapy may be used for the treatment of various types of leukemias. 
 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia  
 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (also known lymphoblastic lymphoma [ALL/LBL] and acute lymphocytic 
leukemia) refers to blood malignancies of lymphoid precursor cells. These entities are described as 
ALL/LBL because in this setting, leukemia and lymphoma display overlapping clinical presentations of the 
same disease; the systems for classification and diagnosis do not distinguish between leukemia and 
lymphoma. Broadly, ALL/LBL is divided into tumors of B cell and T cell descent; tumors of natural killer 
(NK) cell lineage are also recognized but occur less frequently. Because the various subtypes are 
morphologically indistinguishable, immunophenotyping is required to determine the lineage.  
 
Most cases of ALL/LBL have molecular and/or cytogenetic abnormalities that are associated with unique 
phenotypes, prognostic features, and/or influence the choice of treatment. The World Health Organization 
(WHO) classification system uses immunophenotype and cytogenetic/molecular features to delineate 
specific categories of ALL/LBL.  
 
With regards to gene mutation testing in individuals suspected of having ALL/LBL, the NCCN 
recommends: 
 
The Ph-like phenotype is associated with recurrent gene fusions and mutations that 
activate tyrosine kinase pathways and includes gene fusions involving ABL1, ABL2, 
CRLF2, CSFIR, EPOR, JAK2, and PDGFRD and mutations involving FLT3, IL7R, 
SH2B3, JAK1, JAK3, and JAK2 (in combination with CRLF2 gene fusions). Testing 
for these abnormalities at diagnosis may aid in risk stratification. The safety and 
efficacy of targeted agents in this population is an area of active research... In cases of 
hypodiploid ALL where germline TP53 mutations are common, testing should be 
considered (NCCN ALL, 2021).   
 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia  
 
Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) refers to a group of leukemias that arise from a myeloid precursor in the 
bone marrow. Although AML is fairly rare overall, accounting for only about 1% of all cancers it is still 
one of the most common types of leukemia in adults. Cytogenetically normal AML is the largest defined 
subclass of AML and accounts for approximately 45% of all AML cases. In spite of the lack of cytogenetic 
abnormalities, these cases frequently have genetic variants that influence outcomes. The incidence of AML 
increases with age, with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years. Clinical signs and symptoms include but are 
not limited to, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. AML is also known as acute myelocytic 
leukemia, acute myelogenous leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, acute non-lymphocytic leukemia) 
(ACS, 2022).

prognosis, and predict response to therapy. Abnormalities in specific genes, such as mutations in ASXL1, 
BCR-ABL, c-KIT, FLT3-ITD, FLT3-TKD, NPM1, CEBPA (biallelic), IDH1, IDH2, PML-RARA, 
RUNX1, and TP53 confer prognostic significance in adults with AML. In addition to prognostic 
implications, some gene may impact medical decision making or have therapeutic significance in AML 
(NCCN AML 2022).  
 
The revised 2008 World Health Organization (WHO) AML classification scheme emphasizes the 
importance of genetic testing in AML Similarly, NCCN recommends that all individuals suspected of 
having AML be tested for specific gene mutations. Because numerous mutations are associated with AML, 
testing using multiplex gene panels and comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) analysis may be 
used for the ongoing management of AML and various phases of treatment (NCCN AML 2022; Swerdlow, 
2008). For information on gene panel testing in MDS, please refer GENE.00052 Whole Genome 
Sequencing, Whole Exome Sequencing, Gene Panels, and Molecular Profiling. 
 
AML is vigorously treated upon detection with chemotherapy and stem cell transplantation. 
 
Acute Promyelocytic Leukemia 
 
Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a biologically and clinically distinct variation of AML. In 
particular, individuals with APL typically present with symptoms related to complications of anemia, 
neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Other signs and symptoms include combinations of weakness and easy 
fatigability, infections of variable severity, and/or hemorrhagic findings such as gingival bleeding, 
ecchymoses, menorrhagia or epistaxis. Unique to APL is a presentation with bleeding caused by 
disseminated intravascular coagulation. Frequently, by the time that individual seeks medical care, the 
situation has become a life-threatening emergency because of the risk of catastrophic bleeding. Often, at 
diagnosis, the marrow is nearly 100 percent replaced by malignant promyelocytes, which results in severe 
anemia, thrombocytopenia, and neutropenia. 
 
APL represents a medical emergency with a high rate of mortality due to hemorrhage. Treatment of the 
bleeding disorder is usually initiated as soon as the diagnosis is suspected based on cytologic criteria, and 
even before definitive cytogenetic or molecular confirmation of the diagnosis has been made. Gene 
mutation testing is not required to diagnose or treat APL. Diagnosis of APL may be made based on an 
evaluation of the clinical presentation, cell morphology, immunophenotyping, identification of PML/RARα 
rearrangements using karyotyping, real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR), or fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), and immunofluorescence with anti-PML monoclonal antibodies.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the chronic lymphoid neoplasms (lymphoproliferative 
disorders) that is characterized by a progressive accumulation of functionally incompetent lymphocytes, 
which are usually of monoclonal origin. CLL is considered identical (that is, one disease with different 
manifestations) to small lymphocytic lymphoma (SLL). The term CLL is used when the disease manifests 
predominately in the blood, whereas the term SLL is used when involvement is predominately nodal. 
 
The evaluation of suspected cases of CLL varies according to the presentation. The diagnosis of CLL is 
generally suspected in asymptomatic individuals when a routine blood count reveals an absolute 
lymphocytosis. Evaluation of such individuals would usually include a complete blood count with 
differential and peripheral blood immunophenotyping using flow cytometry. Tests to identify genetic 
changes that occur in CLL might include but are not necessarily limited to FISH and PCR to identify 
chromosomal deletions, 13 [del(13q)], and trisomy 12. 
 
The NCCN guidelines on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia indicate that TP53 mutation status is associated 
with low response rates to chemoimmunotherapy and recommends that TP53 mutation testing be done to 
inform prognosis and/or therapy determination.  
 
Del(17p), which reflects the loss of the TP53 gene and is frequently associated with 
mutations in the remaining TP53 allele, is associated with short treatment-free interval, 
short median survival (32 months), and poor response to chemotherapy. TP53 
abnormalities can occur in the absence of del(17p) and TP53 mutations have been 
identified as predictors of resistance to fludarabine-based or bedamustine-based 
regimens and poor survival, independent of 17p chromosome status (NCCN Chronic 
Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, 2022).  
 
Additionally, the NCCN also recommends that IGHV mutation status be determined prior to initiating 
treatment for CLL:  
 
The choice of first-line treatment for CLL/SLL should be based on the disease stage, 
presence or absence of del(17p) or TP53 mutation, IGHV mutation status (if 
considering chemoimmunotherapy), patient’s age, performance status, comorbid 
conditions, and the agent’s toxicity profile. (NCCN Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, 2022).  
 
The mutation status of at least two other genes have been identified as playing an important role in the 
selection of targeted therapies for the treatment of CLL. In individuals with CLL/SLL who do not have 
del(17p)/TP53 mutation, the NCCN states “testing for BTK and PLCG2 mutations may be useful in 
patients with disease progression or no response while on BTK inhibitor therapy. BTK and PLCG2 
mutation status alone is not an indication to change treatment” (NCCN Chronic Lymphocytic 
Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma, 2022).

CLL is an extremely diverse disease with certain subsets of individuals having survival rates without 
treatment that are similar to the normal population. With the possible exception of allogeneic hematopoietic 
cell transplantation (HCT), there currently is no treatment option that can cure CLL. According to the 
NCCN: “Long-term results from several prospective studies have shown that allogeneic hematopoietic cell 
transplant (HCT) can provide long-term disease control and also overcome the poor prognosis associated 
with del(17p) and TP53 mutations” (NCCN Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic 
Lymphoma, 2022). 
 
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 
 
Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), also known as chronic myelogenous, chronic myelocytic or chronic 
granulocytic leukemia) is a myeloproliferative neoplasm in which the bone marrow makes too many 
myeloid cells. These blood cells are abnormal and can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is 
less room for the healthy white blood cells. CML is a relatively uncommon disease, primarily affecting 
older adults at an average age of 64 years. CML it is not an inherited disease. Instead, the DNA mutations 
associated with CML occur over an individual’s lifetime, rather than being present from birth.  
 
CML is associated with the BCR-ABL mutation that is formed by the combining of two genes: BCR (on 
chromosome 22) and ABL1 (on chromosome 9), resulting in the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene (also known as 
the Philadelphia chromosome). The presence of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene confirms the diagnosis of 
CML. CML patients who have the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph+ CML) have a more favorable prognosis 
than those without the Philadelphia chromosome (Ph- CML). Testing for the BCR-ABL abnormality can be 
done using cytogenetics (chromosome analysis or karyotyping), FISH and RT-PCR (to detect and measure 
the BCR-ABL1 RNA transcripts in leukemic cell). DNA sequencing methods may be used to identify 
secondary mutations within BCR-ABL1 that are known to cause resistance to therapy. 
 
Prior to the availability of protein tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), the only curative option for CML was 
high-dose chemotherapy with hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT). but with the emergence of 
BCR-ABL-targeted TKIs, the role of HSCT has become less clear. Protein TKIs are typically utilized in the 
treatment of CML. Point mutations in the BCR-ABL1 kinase domain are a frequent mechanism of 
secondary resistance to TKI therapy and are associated with poor prognosis and higher risk of disease 
progression.  
 
Several drugs in the protein TKI class have now been approved by the United States Food and Drug 
Administration for the treatment of CML Most individuals have a good response to this first-line of 
therapy. However, some individuals develop secondary (acquired) resistance to the first-line therapeutic 
agent, which may be due to secondary mutations of the BCR-ABL gene. BCR-ABL1 kinase domain (KD) 
mutation status can be used to guide selection of alternative TKIs for CML patients who experience 
resistance to or intolerance to initial TKI therapy. The NCCN recommends that in individuals who present 
with advanced phase CML, the selection of TKI should be based on prior therapy and/or BCR-ABL1 
mutation profile.

Additionally, according to the NCCN, “NGS allows for the detection of low-level BCR-ABL1 kinase 
domain mutations as well as resistance mutations in genes other than BCR-ABL1 that may confer 
resistance to TKIs or portend disease progression” and “NGS with myeloid mutation panel should be 
considered for patients with no identifiable BCR-ABL1 mutations” (NCCN Chronic Myeloid Leukemia, 
V1 2023).  
 
The NCCN also recommends gene mutational analysis when allogeneic hematopoietic cell transplantation 
is being considered for patients with advanced phase CML. 
 
Hairy Cell Leukemia 
 
Hairy cell leukemia (HCL) is a relatively uncommon chronic B cell lymphoproliferative disorder 
(lymphoid neoplasm) characterized by the build-up of small mature B cell lymphoid cells with abundant 
cytoplasm and "hairy" projections inside the peripheral blood, bone marrow, and splenic red pulp. This 
typically causes splenomegaly and a variable decline in the production of normal red blood cells, platelets, 
mature granulocytes, and monocytes. The amplified production of malignant cells, along with a decrease in 
these mature elements, results in a variety of systemic consequences, including, but not limited to, anemia, 
splenomegaly, bleeding, and an increased risk of infection. 
 
The etiology of HCL is not completely understood. Most cases of HCL are believed to arise from a late, 
activated memory B cell somatic BRAF V600E gene mutation. The resultant abnormal activation of the 
RAF-MEK-ERK signaling pathway leads to a distinct phenotype and prolonged cell survival.  
 
Exposures to environmental hazards such as ionizing radiation and pesticides have been mentioned as 
possible causes. Exposure to cigarette smoke, alcohol consumption, solvents and obesity do not appear to 
be risk factors for the development of HCL. 
 
The diagnosis of HCL is generally made based on the results of bone marrow biopsy and aspirate in 
conjunction with immunophenotyping by flow cytometry. The aberrant (“hairy”) cells exhibit expression of 
pan-B cell antigens (for example, CD19, CD20, CD22) along with CD103, CD11c, and CD25. Gene 
mutation testing is typically not required to make the diagnosis of HCL. 
 
Because this malignancy progresses very slowly and sometimes doesn't progress at all, it is not always 
necessary to begin treatment for HCL immediately after the diagnosis is confirmed.  
 
Systemic Mastocytosis 
 
Systemic mastocytosis is a rare disorder characterized by the expansion and focal accumulation of 
neoplastic mast cells (MC) in various organs, including the skin, spleen, liver, bone marrow and 
gastrointestinal tract. The World Health Organization (WHO) categorizes mastocytosis into cutaneous

mastocytosis (CM), systemic mastocytosis (SM) and mast cell sarcoma (MCS). WHO also further 
delineates SM into additional categories based on disease-specific features:  
1. Indolent SM (ISM) 
2. Smoldering SM (SSM) 
3. Aggressive SM (ASM) 
4. SM with an associated hematopoietic neoplasm (SM-AHN) and 
5. MC leukemia (MCL).  
 
MCS is a rare, localized, aggressive MC tumor that typically progresses to MCL within a short time. 
Advanced SM (ASM, SM-AHN, MCL) and MCS have unfavorable prognoses. Without successful therapy, 
the estimated median survival time in these individuals is less than 3 years. Once the diagnosis of SM has 
been made, the subtype (variant) of disease must be identified, as treatment and prognosis differ for each 
disorder\ (Valent, 2021). 
 
Systemic mastocytosis is frequently diagnosed after affected individuals seek medical care for symptoms 
caused by the disorder. Symptoms of systemic mastocytosis may include cutaneous lesions, flushing, 
itching, hives, abdominal pain, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, bone or muscle pain, anemia, bleeding 
disorders, splenomegaly, lymphadenopathy, depression, mood changes and problems concentrating.  
 
A somatic mutation in the KIT gene is the most common genetic alteration found in systemic mastocytosis. 
The KIT gene encodes a protein that helps regulate cell growth and division. When the KIT gene is 
mutated, it can cause uncontrolled production of MCs which then accumulate in various organs of the 
body.  
 
With regards to gene mutation testing for individuals suspected of having systemic mastocytosis, the 
NCCN recommends that: 
 
If a diagnosis of SM is suspected, molecular testing for KIT D816V using an assay with 
high sensitivity (eg, ASO-qPCR or digital droplet PCT) can first be undertaken on the 
peripheral blood, in combination with measurement of the serum tryptase level and 
evaluation of clinical signs and/or symptoms suggestive of SM-related organ 
involvement. 
 
Following a positive test of peripheral blood, KIT mutational analysis may also be 
performed on the bone marrow aspirate. Fresh bone marrow is aspirate is preferable but 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue can also be used. Decalcified tissue typically 
interferes with DNA/RNA assays, and thus, decalcified BM should not be used for 
mutational analysis. If initial screening of the peripheral blood fails to detect the KIT 
D816V mutation in a patient with suspected SM, testing of the bone marrow should be 
undertaken with a highly sensitive assay (eg, ASO-qPCR or digital droplet PCR).

Additionally, the NCCN recommends: 
 
Myeloid mutation panel testing should be performed on the bone marrow, but can be 
performed on the peripheral blood in the presence of an AHN and/or circulating mast 
cells. Myeloid mutation panels alone are not recommended for the detection of KIT 
D816V. Next-generation sequencing (NGS) assays can exhibit low sensitivity and 
higher-sensitivity assays should always be performed (NCCN Systemic Mastocytosis, 
2021).  
 
Currently, there is no treatment of systemic mastocytosis. Treatment is targeted at relieving the effects of 
MC overgrowth and avoiding environmental and dietary triggers. 
 
Targeted Therapy and Treatment Planning for Myelodysplastic Syndromes 
 
The myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) consist of a group of blood malignancies characterized by clonal 
hematopoiesis, one or more cytopenias (ie, anemia, neutropenia, and/or thrombocytopenia), and atypical 
cellular maturation. MDS shares some pathologic and clinical features with AML, but MDS has a lower 
percentage of blasts in bone marrow and peripheral blood (by definition, < 20 percent). Individuals with MDS 
are at risk for symptomatic anemia, infection, bleeding, and transformation to AML. Because the clinical 
presentation of MDS in individuals varies significantly, diagnosis and disease stratification are based on 
multiple factors including clinical data, morphology of peripheral blood and bone marrow, cytogenetics, 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), flow cytometry and next-generational sequencing myeloid mutations 
studies. The primary clinical challenge in these disorders are morbidities caused by cytopenias and the potential 
for MDS to evolve into acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Additionally, there are complications that may arise as 
a result of chronic transfusions, treatment toxicity and in some cases systemic inflammatory conditions (NCCN 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes, 2022). 
 
Genetic frequently somatically mutated in MDS include: ASXL1, BCOR, CALR, CBL, DDX41, DNMT3A, 
ETV6, EZH2, FLT3, GATA2, IDH1, IDH2, JAK2, MPL, NF1, NPM1, NRAS, PHF6, PPM1D, RUNX1, 
SETBP1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, STAT3, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, WT1, ZRSR2. However, it is important to 
note that several MDS-associated genes, (including but not limited to DNMT3A, EZH2, NRAS, SF3B1, TP53 
and TET2) can occur in non-disease states and no single gene mutation is diagnostic of MDS. Additionally, 
mutations in several genes can occur in neoplasms other than MDS including malignancies of lymphoid origin 
such as acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Therefore, mutations 
should not be considered presumptive evidence of MDS when the diagnostic criteria for MDS have not been 
met. Instead, gene mutation testing may be used to inform the diagnosis of MDS (NCCN Myelodysplastic 
Syndromes, 2022). For information on gene panel testing in MDS, please refer GENE.00052 Whole Genome 
Sequencing, Whole Exome Sequencing, Gene Panels, and Molecular Profiling. 
 
Mutations in several genes have prognostic value. As an example, mutations of ASXL1, ETV6, EZH2, RUNX1 
and TP53 have been associated with decreased overall survival, while only mutations in SF3B1 have been

Targeted Therapy and Treatment Planning for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms (MPNs)/Myeloproliferative 
Disorders (MPDs) 
 
The MPDs/MPNs are a large group of relatively rare pathogenetically related diseases arising in the bone 
marrow and characterized by the proliferation of one or more myeloid cell lines in the bone marrow resulting in 
increased numbers of relatively mature neoplastic cells in the peripheral blood. According to the World Health 
Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue, MPNs include 
chronic myelogenous leukemia (BCR-ABL1 positive [CML]), PV, PMF and ET. However, CML is unique in 
that it is the only one of these conditions that is positive for the BCR-ABL1 translocation. The others, PV, MF 
and ET are considered part of the operational sub-category of BCR-ABL1 negative conditions (Swerdlow, 
2017). 
 
MPNs are characterized by a complex collection of symptoms. The symptoms vary within and between each 
MPN subtype, but typically include constitutional symptoms such as fatigue, weight loss, pruritus, symptoms 
associated with splenomegaly, and a variety of laboratory abnormalities, including leukocytosis, 
thrombocytosis and erythrocytosis. And while there are a number of shared clinical features across the 
conditions, each of the three BCR-ABL–negative MPNs is considered a distinct clinical entity. ET is 
characterized by elevation in platelet count and megakaryocyte proliferation in the bone marrow. PV is 
distinguished by an increase in red blood cell production, with resulting increases in RBC mass and 
hemoglobin and hematocrit levels. Frequently, platelet and white blood cell count are also elevated. PMF is 
characterized by anemia, progressive splenomegaly and bone marrow fibrosis, and multi-organ extramedullary 
hematopoiesis. Most of these features, however, are not diagnostically specific, and secondary causes of 
erythrocytosis, thrombocytosis and bone marrow fibrosis must be excluded.  
 
The BCR-ABL1–negative MPNs are genetically characterized by the overlapping presence of mutations in 
three driver genes—JAK2, CALR, and MPL. Mutations in either of these driver genes results in increased 
activity in the JAK/STAT signal transduction pathway.  
 
The diagnosis and monitoring of individuals with BCR-ABL–negative MPN can be challenging because 
several of the clinical and laboratory features of the classic forms of these diseases-PV, ET, or PMF-can be 
mimicked by other conditions such as myeloid fibrosis. Additionally, these diseases cannot always be identified 
with certainty on morphologic bone marrow exam, and diagnosis can be complicated by altering disease 
patterns. As an example, PV and ET can undergo a leukemic transformation or evolve into PMF.

The 2017 WHO guidelines on the Classification of Tumours of Haematopoietic and Lymphoid Tissue were 
revised in 2017 to reflect the recent discovery of genetic abnormalities involved in the pathogenesis of BCR-
ABL1 negative MPN. The WHO diagnostic criteria include a combination of clinical, laboratory cytogenetic, 
and molecular testing. The diagnosis of PMF requires the individual to meet 3 major and 2 minor criteria. The 
diagnosis of PV requires meeting both major criteria and one minor criterion or the presence of the first major 
criterion together with two minor criteria, whereas the diagnosis of ET requires meeting all 4 criteria The 2017 
WHO criteria recommends that JAK2V617F and other clonal markers be tested in individuals suspected of 
having ET and PMF. WHO also recommends that testing for JAK2V617F and JAK2 exon 12 variants be 
conducted in individuals suspected of having PV. These guidelines also provide the following information 
regarding JAK2 mutation testing:  
 
JAK2 mutations are not specific for any single clinical or morphologic MPN phenotype, 
and are also reported in some cases of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), 
myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms (MDS/MPN) and acute myeloid leukaemia 
(AML). Thus, an integrated, multidisciplinary approach is necessary for the classification 
of myeloid neoplasms (Swerdlow, 2017). 
 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on Myeloproliferative Neoplasms 
recommends that molecular testing for JAK2V617F mutations be performed in all individuals suspected of 
having ET, MF or PV. For individuals suspected of having PV, when JAK2V617F mutation testing is negative, 
molecular testing for the JAK2 exon 12 mutation should also be conducted. These NCCN guidelines include 
MPL mutation testing in the initial workup of all individuals suspected of having an MPN. The NCCN 
recommends that when JAK2 V617F mutation testing is negative, molecular testing for MPL and CALR 
mutations should be performed for individuals with MF and ET (NCCN, 2021). 
 
Table B below contains a list of targeted cancer therapies, the associated cancer and the genetic variant that 
may be tested in order to direct targeted cancer therapy, including to guide recommended treatment planning. 
This information may be used to determine the appropriateness of a requested genetic test when considering the 
medical necessity criteria in the section above labeled: Gene Mutation Testing to Guide Targeted Cancer 
Therapy. Table B is current as of the publish date of this document. FDA approvals after the publish date (for 
example new drugs or new indications for existing drugs), will not be reflected in Table B until the next publish 
date. Reviewers should not rely solely on the absence of a drug/gene combination in Table B when determining 
whether a particular gene test meets the medical necessity criteria. For additional information and periodic 
updates on drug and companion diagnostic device approvals/clearances, visit the FDA websites at: 
https://labels.fda.gov/ and https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/vitro-diagnostics/list-cleared-or-approved-

Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility and Management 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

C. Circulating Tumor DNA (Liquid Biopsy) 
 
Cancer develops from genetic alterations in DNA that affect the way cells grow and divide. A tissue biopsy is 
the gold standard for detecting DNA alterations that can be used to identify cancer, determine treatment 
options, or evaluate responsiveness to treatment. Tissue biopsies have several disadvantages: the biopsy 
procedure may be painful, such as the insertion of a long needle or a surgical procedure; the retrieved tissue 
may be too small for analysis; or an individual may not be able to physically tolerate the procedure. In addition, 
because tissue biopsies only represent cellular samples from parts of a tumor, important diagnostic data could 
be missed.  
 
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), also known as liquid biopsy, is proposed as a less-invasive method for cancer 
identification, surveillance, and treatment guidance. The National Cancer Institute (NCI) defines liquid biopsy 
as “A test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer cells from a tumor that are circulating in the blood or 
for pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are in the blood.” Tests of ctDNA detect small fragments of mutated 
DNA that are released from tumors into blood, presumably by apoptosis and/or necrosis. These tests are being 
explored as a less-invasive diagnostic alternative to tissue biopsies to improve the selection of targeted 
therapeutic agents for late-stage cancers and for post-cancer monitoring. 
 
There are several limitations of liquid biopsies. Regarding cancer management, many cancers do not have 
specific DNA variants that can be identified and, when present, can be different in individuals with the same 
cancer. The DNA found in the fluid sample may not fully represent the tumor and mislead treatment decisions. 
The genetic variants found may not be “driver” variants and may not provide useful information about the 
cancer. Regarding cancer detection, liquid biopsies can test positive for cancer when no cancer is present (false-
positive) or test negative when cancer is present (false-negative). Because cancer cells release more mutated 
DNA fragments in later cancer stages, the test may not identify early cancer. Likewise, a liquid biopsy can 
detect cancerous cells that may never actually cause harm, leading to overtreatment (NCI, 2018). While liquid 
biopsies are promising, a great deal of research is still needed to determine when these tests improve outcomes 
for individuals with cancer. Nonetheless, in circumstances when tumor tissue is inadequate in quality or 
quantity or is unavailable for testing, and the presence or absence of a variant is likely to guide drug treatment, 
it is reasonable to test for ctDNA given that no alternative exists. 
 
Liquid biopsies are regulated by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) program, which 
oversees and certifies the laboratories conducting FDA-approved and non-FDA approved tests. The FDA 
approval or clearance does not necessarily imply that the test improves clinical outcomes or should be used for 
clinical management. Testing for ctDNA performed in CLIA-certified laboratories also do not require evidence 
of clinical utility; only analytical and clinical validity of the test must be demonstrated prior to clinical use.

This document does not address ctDNA panel testing (defined by five or more genes or gene variants 
tested on the same day on the same member by the same rendering provider). For information on 
ctDNA panel testing, see GENE.00049 Circulating Tumor DNA Panel Testing for Cancer (Liquid 
Biopsy).  
 
EGFR Mutation Testing to Select Targeted Therapy in Individuals with Non-small Cell Lung Cancer  
 
Liquid biopsy tests for ctDNA are targeted for specific gene variants. For example, in the instance of NSCLC, a 
targeted liquid biopsy may be used to identify the presence of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) 
variant and determine if individuals may benefit from kinase inhibitor medication.  
 
The College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and the 
Association for Molecular Pathology released a joint guideline for the selection of lung cancer patients for 
treatment with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKI) (Lindeman, 2018). This document has a strong 
recommendation stating, “In lung adenocarcinoma patients who harbor sensitizing EGFR mutations and have 
progressed after treatment with an EGFR-targeted TKI, physicians must use EGFR T790M mutational testing 
when selecting patients for third-generation EGFR-targeted therapy.” Regarding circulating tumor cell testing 
(also referred to as circulating plasma cfDNA, plasma cfDNA and cfDNA), they state the following: 
 
• There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of circulating plasma cfDNA molecular methods 
for establishing a primary diagnosis of lung adenocarcinoma (no recommendation; insufficient evidence, 
confidence, or agreement to provide a recommendation). 
• In some clinical settings in which tissue is limited and/or insufficient for molecular testing, physicians may 
use a cfDNA assay to identify EGFR mutations (recommendation; some limitations in quality of evidence). 
• Physicians may use plasma cfDNA methods to identify EGFR T790M mutations in lung adenocarcinoma 
patients with progression or secondary clinical resistance to EGFR-targeted TKIs; testing of the tumor 
sample is recommended if the plasma result is negative (expert consensus opinion; serious limitations in 
quality of evidence).  
 
The NCCN has the following category 2A recommendation regarding ctDNA testing to identify the EGFR 
variant in individuals with NSCLC: “If there is insufficient tissue to allow testing for all of EGFR, ALK, ROS1 
and BRAF, repeat biopsy and/or plasma testing should be done.” (NCCN NSCLC V2.2021).  
 
The FDA has approved at least two tests for detecting the EGFR variant in individuals with NSCLC. For 
example: 
• cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 (Roche Molecular Systems Inc., Pleasanton, CA, USA)  
− Solid tumor tissue testing: 
On June 1, 2016, the FDA in PMA (P150047) expanded the approval of the cobas
®
 Mutation Test v2

is indicated as a companion diagnostic to identify individuals who have exon 19 deletions or L858R 
mutations and would benefit from treatment with Tarceva® (erlotinib), a kinase inhibitor. According to 
the FDA, individuals who test negative with the cobas plasma test should undergo a tissue biopsy for 
confirmation (FDA 2016[b]).  
− ctDNA testing: 
On September 28, 2016, the FDA approved the cobas plasma test for detecting the EGFR T790M 
mutation for individuals who would benefit from treatment with Tagrisso (osimertinib), a kinase 
inhibitor recommended after progression of NSCLC during first-line treatment (P150044). The FDA 
states that the efficacy of the plasma test for targeting Tagrisso is limited, and plasma specimens should 
only be used when a tissue biopsy is not possible (FDA 2016[c]).  
 
In addition to the FDA-approved companion diagnostic tests, some commercially available tests (performed at 
a CLIA certified laboratories) are available which detect EGFR variants in individuals with non-small cell lung 
cancer are also available. As an example, OncoBEAM
™
 (Sysmex Inostics, Mundelein, IL) has developed the 
Lung1 EGFR ctDNA test which may be used to identify individuals with non-small cell lung cancer who may 
benefit from treatment with an EGFR-targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitor. 
 
PIK3CA Mutation Testing to Select Targeted Therapy in Individuals with Breast Cancer 
 
Mutations in the phosphatidylinositol-4, 5-bisphosphate 3-kinase, catalytic subunit alpha (PIK3CA) gene have 
been implicated in the pathogenesis of several cancers, including but not limited to colon, gastric, breast, 
endometrial, and lung cancer. Researchers are exploring the role of PIK3CA mutations in the initiation, 
progression and management of various cancers. 
 
Mutations in the PIK3CA gene can also lead to the development of a group of rare, non-malignant disorders 
collectively known as PIK3CA-related overgrowth spectrum (PROS). PROS disorders include fibroadipose 
hyperplasia, CLOVES syndrome, megalencephaly-capillary malformation (MCAP) syndrome, 
hemihyperplasia‐multiple lipomatosis (HHML) syndrome, hemimegalencephaly and facial infiltrating 
lipomatosis. This document does not address PROS.  
 
Other names for PIK3CA include but are not limited to:  
• catalytic subunit alpha polypeptide gene 
• PI3K 
• PI3KCA 
• PI3K-alpha 
• PI3-kinase p110 subunit alpha.  
 
The FDA approved the companion diagnostic test therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit (QIAGEN Germantown, 
MD) to detect the PIK3CA variants in both, a breast tumor tissue specimen and a plasma specimen (ctDNA). 
According to the FDA, individuals who are negative by the therascreen test using the ctDNA should undergo 
tumor biopsy for PIK3CA variant testing. Use of the ctDNA test has not been evaluated in a prospective

clinical study; approval was based on a retrospective secondary analysis of participants enrolled in the SOLAR-
1 clinical trial. The SOLAR-1 trial evaluated alpelisib on the basis of tumor-tissue PIK3CA mutation status. 
 
The May 24, 2019 FDA Summary and Effectiveness Data (SSED) includes a discussion of the concordance of 
the PIK3CA variant results of the therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit (P190004) which uses plasma samples 
and the therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit, which uses tissue samples (P190001). Of the 328 PIK3CA tissue 
positive subjects, only 179 were plasma PIK3CA positive. Of the 215 PIK3CA tissue negative subjects, 209 
were plasma PIK3CA negative. The negative percent agreement (NPA) was 97.2% while the positive percent 
agreement (PPA) was only 54.6%. It was noted that five PIK3CA variants (H1047Y, Q546R, Q546E, E545D 
and E545A) were not identified by the therascreen PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit using plasma clinical samples. FDA 
approval of the PIK3CA RGQ PCR Kit is contingent upon additional post market accuracy studies of those 
variants. Because of the high false negative rate (the plasma test failed to discover approximately 46% of the 
variants identified in the tumor tissue test), reflex testing of plasma mutation negative samples using tissue 
specimens is required.  
 
The NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines on Breast Cancer (V2.2022) recommends that in individuals with HR-
positive/HER2-negative breast cancer, PIK3CA mutation testing using tumor tissue or ctDNA in peripheral 
blood (liquid biopsy) be conducted in order to identify candidates for alpelisib plus fulvestrant, (category 1 
rating). If liquid biopsy results are negative, tumor tissue testing is recommended.  
 
With regard to treatment regimens for men with breast cancer, the NCCN indicates the following:  
 
Management of advanced breast cancer in males is similar to that in females; however, it is 
preferred that when an aromatase inhibitor is used, a GnRH analog should be given 
concurrently. Available data suggest single-agent fulvestrant has similar efficacy in males 
as in females. Newer agents such as CDK4/6 inhibitors in combination with an aromatase 
inhibitor or fulvestrant, mTOR inhibitors, and PIK3CA inhibitors have not been 
systematically evaluated in clinical trials in males with breast cancer. However available 
real-world data suggest comparable efficacy and safety profiles and it is reasonable to 
recommend these agents to males based on extrapolation of data from studies comprised 
largely of female participants with advanced breast cancer.  
 
Testing to Detect the Recurrence of Colorectal Cancer  
 
Colvera
™ 
(Clinical Genomics Pathology, Bridgewater, NJ) has been explored as a liquid biopsy test to detect 
the recurrence of colorectal cancer (CRC). In 2017, Murray and colleagues investigated the analytical and 
clinical validity of the Colvera plasma test for the detection of methylated BCAT1 and IKZF1 in individuals 
with CRC. The researchers randomized 264 plasma samples and 120 buffer samples, divided the samples into 8 
batches of 48, and processed the samples over 8 days using 2 equipment lines. Clinical validity was analyzed 
by using Colvera on 222 archived plasma samples (n=26 with known CRC) from individuals who were 
scheduled for colonoscopy as part of a previous trial (Pedersen, 2015). The researchers found that the limit of

detection (LOD) was 12.6 pg/ml (95% confidence interval [CI], 8.6 to 23.9), the equivalent of 2 diploid 
genomes/ml of plasma. Colvera tested positive for 19/26 known cancer cases for an agreement of 73% (95% 
CI, 52% to 88%). For the 196 nonneoplastic subjects, Colvera had an agreement of 89% (95% CI, 84% to 
93%). Total agreement was 87% (194/222; 95% CI, 82% to 91%). Limitations of the study included a small 
sample size. 
 
In 2020, Musher and colleagues published a cross-sectional study evaluating the diagnostic accuracy of the 
Colvera test compared with carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) for identifying recurrence of CRC. The study 
enrolled 537 adults who were undergoing surveillance after treatment for stage II or III CRC. Blood samples 
were collected at a single time point, within 6 months of surveillance radiological imaging, and evaluated using 
the Colvera test and CEA. A total of 322 (60%) individuals were included in the final analysis; 20 (3.7%) were 
excluded because they did not meet eligibility criteria and 195 (36.3%) were excluded for insufficient 
information. Among the evaluable participants, CRC recurrence occurred in 27 (8.4%) of individuals. The 
sensitivity of the Colvera test for detecting CRC recurrence (63%) was significantly higher than CEA testing 
(48.1%), p=0.046. However, the specificity of CEA testing (96.3%) was significantly higher than Colvera 
testing (91.5%), p=0.012. While the Colvera test appears to be a promising diagnostic tool to predict the 
recurrence of CRC, the study has several limitations which prevent drawing conclusions regarding its 
diagnostic accuracy. For example, as discussed above, a substantial proportion (40%) of study participants were 
excluded from the analysis. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that although this study demonstrated that 
the specificity of CEA in the 295 subjects without cancer recurrence was higher than that of Colvera, the 
significance of a false positive result in this study is uncertain due to the relatively short follow-up period. 
Because the Colvera and CEA results were correlated with only one imaging test, it is possible that some 
individuals thought to be without recurrence might later prove to have recurrent disease after further imaging. 
Additional well-designed prospective, randomized controlled trials with longer follow-up are needed to 
determine whether, Colvera, when compared to CEA facilitates earlier diagnosis of CRC recurrence and, in 
turn, improves cancer-related outcomes.

Targeted cancer therapy: Targeted cancer therapies are drugs or other substances that block the growth and spread 
of cancer by interfering with specific molecules ("molecular targets") that are involved in the growth, progression, 
and spread of cancer. They recognize a specific feature of the cancer cell, attach to it, and destroy it. Targeted 
cancer therapies are sometimes called "molecularly targeted drugs," "molecularly targeted therapies," "precision 
medicines," or similar names (NCI, 2014).

Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility and Management 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Clinical UM Guideline  
CG-GENE-14 
Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility and Management 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility and Management 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Gene Mutation Testing for Cancer Susceptibility and Management 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.
