necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Description 
 
This document addresses testing for certain diseases with an established genetic basis. It includes testing of 
individual genes for individuals at risk and preconception or prenatal genetic testing of a prospective parent or 
parent to determine carrier status for an autosomal recessive disorder, an x-linked disorder, a disorder with variable 
penetrance, or to confirm the diagnosis of a disorder when genetic testing may lead to changes in clinical 
management for those with uncertain clinical features.  
 
Notes: 
• Genetic counseling should be a component of a decision to perform genetic testing. 
• This document only addresses molecular genetic testing and does not provide criteria for karyotype 
analysis or biochemical testing. 
• This document does not address whole exome or whole genome testing or testing of 5 or more genes as a

Testing of individual genes for germline genetic diseases is considered medically necessary when all the criteria 
for the individual to be tested and for the genetic disorder being tested for (both Criteria A and B) are met: 
 
A.       Requirements for the individual: 
           The individual to be tested: 
1.  Is either at significant risk for a genetic disease (for example, based on family history) or suspected to 
have a known genetic disease; and  
2.  Has received genetic counseling encompassing all of the following components: 
a. Interpretation of family and medical histories to assess the probability of disease occurrence or 
recurrence; and 
b. Education about inheritance, genetic testing, disease management, prevention and resources; and 
c. Counseling to promote informed choices and adaptation to the risk or presence of a genetic condition;    
and 
d. Counseling for the psychological aspects of genetic testing.  
 
and 
B.        Requirements for the genetic disorder(s) being tested for: 
1. A specific mutation, or set of mutations, has been established in the scientific literature to be reliably 
associated with the disease; and  
2. A biochemical or other test is identified but the results are indeterminate, or the genetic disorder cannot 
be identified through biochemical or other testing; and  
3. The genetic disorder is associated with a potentially significant disability or has a lethal natural history; 
and 
4. A positive or negative result of the genetic test will impact the clinical management (predictive, 
diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic*) of the individual.  For example, genetic test results will guide 
treatment decisions, surveillance recommendations or preventive strategies; and  
5. The findings of the genetic test will likely result in improvement in net health outcomes; that is, the 
expected health benefits of the interventions outweigh any harmful effects (medical or psychological) of 
the intervention.  
 
*Note:  See the Definitions section for information about predictive, diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic genetic 
testing.  
 
Preconception or prenatal genetic screening of a parent or prospective parent to determine carrier status of germline 
genetic disorders is considered medically necessary when criteria for family history and for the specific genetic 
test (both Criteria C and D) are met:  
 
C.        Criteria based on family history:  
   Genetic screening of the parent or prospective parent is considered medically necessary when one of the 
following criteria is met:

Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Discussion/General Information 
 
The phrase genetic testing can refer to the analysis of an individual’s deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic 
acid (RNA), chromosomes, genes, or gene products, (such as enzymes and other proteins), to identify germline 
(inherited) or somatic (non-inherited) genetic variations associated with health or disease. This document is only 
concerned with the testing of individual genes at the molecular level for individuals at risk or for preconception or 
prenatal testing. 
 
The use of genetic testing information is being explored as a means to: 
• Guide predictive considerations and prognosis in asymptomatic individuals;  
• Guide diagnosis, prognosis and treatment options, including response to therapies, in symptomatic 
individuals;  
• Identify individuals at risk for the development of disorders in the future, (for example, susceptibility 
testing or population risk assessment). 
 
Genetic tests are done for many reasons:  
 
• Pregnancy-related genetic testing (preconception, prenatal, pre-implantation, in vitro fertilization) may be 
done prior to or during pregnancy to guide reproductive decisions, as part of assistive reproductive 
procedures, and for other reasons. This includes carrier testing to identify individuals who possess one copy 
of a gene variant that, when present in two copies, results in a specific genetic disorder. Having only one 
copy of the gene variant does not place the individual being tested at increased risk of developing the 
disease, but will increase the risk of the individual having an affected child who will develop the disease 
and may necessitate pregnancy-related genetic testing. Genetic testing for pregnancy-related conditions is

Diagnosis Testing.  
• Somatic cell genetic testing involves the testing of tissue, (most often cancerous tissue), for variants that are 
not inherited. This testing is generally done for diagnostic purposes or to assist in the selection of a cancer 
treatment. Genetic testing for somatic cell variants is addressed more specifically in other documents.  
• Predictive, diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic (see definition section) testing is also performed. Each 
gene to be tested is evaluated to determine whether or not identified genetic variants reliably identify a 
genetic disorder and that results of the genetic test will impact the management of the individual’s

condition with a likelihood of improved clinical outcomes. Examples of ways a test may impact these 
objectives include guiding treatment decisions, formulating surveillance recommendations or guiding 
preventive strategies. The results of genetic testing are also expected to improve net health outcomes, 
which requires that the test results are actionable and that any actions taken are not outweighed by harmful 
effects from the intervention. 
 
Genetic Counseling 
Due to the potential impact of positive genetic test results, it is generally recommended that genetic testing only be 
provided in conjunction with genetic counseling. Genetic counseling should include a discussion of the potential 
risks for a particular genetic disorder and how identification of a genetic variant will impact treatment management. 
According to the National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC), genetic counseling is the process of assisting 
individuals to understand and adapt to the medical, psychological and familial ramifications of a genetic disease. 
This process typically includes the guidance of a specially trained professional who:  
1. Integrates the interpretation of family and medical histories to assess the probability of disease occurrence 
or recurrence; and  
2. Provides education about inheritance, genetic testing, disease management, prevention and resources; and  
3. Provides counseling to promote informed choices and adaptation to the risk or presence of a genetic 
condition; and  
4. Provides counseling for the psychological aspects of genetic testing (NSGC, 2006). 
 
The following table lists commonly requested gene testing targets, along with an assessment of whether or not they 
have been shown to be useful in guiding clinical management, determining carrier status, or guiding reproductive 
decisions. Tests listed in the table with a check in the column for, “Individual genome testing may impact clinical 
management” have been shown to be useful in guiding clinical management and, in the right circumstances, 
findings from genetic testing may result in improved net clinical outcomes. There are many reasons why some of 
the tests below do not have a check mark. This may be because knowledge of the genetic status does not change the 
management of the condition, has not been shown to facilitate decision making around reproduction, or may be 
associated with genes that exhibit problematic interpretation in the context of preconception or prenatal genetic 
testing (for example, conditions primarily associated with late age of onset, mild phenotype, and/or incomplete 
penetrance).  
 
In addition to showing that a test may be useful for guiding clinical management, determining carrier status, or 
guiding reproductive decisions, requests for test coverage must also document that improvements in net health 
outcomes are expected as a result of the testing. The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics 
(ACMG) periodically issues a list of recommended genes for guidance in reporting secondary findings in the 
context of clinical exome and genome sequencing. The listed genes include associated research about utility related 
to specific genetic conditions. The following table contains genes from the latest ACMG listing, along with 
recommended usefulness for preconception/prenatal testing and testing that would impact clinical management for 
a particular disease or condition when applicable. For further information see:

Preconception or Prenatal Testing (Return to Clinical Indications) 
Carrier testing for inherited genetic conditions is a key component of preconception and prenatal care. Carrier 
testing is conducted to identify an individual or a couple at risk (parent or prospective parent) for passing on genetic 
conditions to their offspring. Carriers are asymptomatic individuals who are typically not at risk for developing the 
disease, but who possess the potential to pass the gene variant to their offspring. Carrier testing is frequently

performed on the parent or prospective parent before conception or during a pregnancy. In 2017, the American 
College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Committee on Genetics issued its Committee Opinion No. 691 
on carrier screening for genetic conditions, in which ACOG recommended, “If an individual is found to be a carrier 
for a specific condition, the patient’s reproductive partner should be offered testing in order to receive informed 
genetic counseling about potential reproductive outcomes” (ACOG, 2017[b]). 
Carrier screening may be conducted for conditions that are found in the general population (panethnic), for diseases 
that are more common in a particular population, or based on family history. Panethnic screening (population 
screening) for carrier status is done for single-gene disorders that are common in the population. 
Preconception or prenatal genetic testing of a parent or prospective parent is a common practice to determine carrier 
status. For example, ACOG and the ACMG recommend carrier screening for: Tay-Sach’s disease, Canavan 
disease, mucolipidosis IV, Niemann Pick Disease Type A, Fanconi anemia group C, Bloom syndrome, Gaucher’s 
disease and familial dysautonomia among individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish descent (ACOG, 2009; Gross, 2008). 
With regard to Fragile X syndrome, the ACMG has provided guidance on prenatal and preconception testing, and 
ACOG has published a Committee Opinion for carrier screening (Sherman, 2005; ACOG, 2009; ACOG, 2010; 
ACOG, 2017[b]). 
Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis and Other Adult-onset Diseases  
There has also been a growing interest in the use of genetic testing for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS, Lou 
Gehrig’s disease). ALS is an adult-onset, progressive neurodegenerative disorder that affects nerve cells in the 
spinal cord and brain that eventually results in paralysis and death. The mean age of onset for ALS is 56 years in 
individuals without a positive family history and 46 years in individuals with more than one affected family 
member (familial ALS). Disease duration can vary significantly, but has been estimated to average approximately 3 
years. Death usually results from respiratory failure. Alterations in several genes, including superoxide dismutase 1 
(SOD1), angiogenin (ANG), TAR DNA binding protein (TARDP), and optineurin (OPTN), have been associated 
with the development of ALS. Familial ALS can be inherited in an autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, or X-
linked fashion. Penetrance of familial ALS is age and variant dependent; approximately 50% of individuals with an 
SOD1 pathogenic variant are symptomatic by 46 years of age and 90% are symptomatic by 70 years of age. 
However, these percentages may be inflated due to ascertainment bias in families with high penetrance (Gene 
Reviews, 2015). 
Neither ACOG nor ACMG recommend prenatal genetic testing for ALS. With regard to predictive genetic testing 
and the screening of children for adult-onset conditions, the ACMG has indicated that, “If clinical benefits will not 
accrue for years to decades, testing should be deferred until adulthood or should require parent or guardian 
permission, as well as adolescent assent.” ACMG also notes that most predictive genetic testing for adult-onset 
conditions is predispositional, that is, testing for genes that are incompletely penetrant and may never become 
manifest (Ross, 2013). The ACOG Committee Opinion number 690 states, “Carrier screening panels should not 
include conditions primarily associated with a disease of adult onset” (ACOG, 2017[a]). The National Society of 
Genetic Counselors (NSGC) does not support the use of prenatal genetic testing for known adult-onset conditions if 
pregnancy or childhood management will not be affected (Hercher, 2016). Alpha 1 antitrypsin deficiency

(incompletely associated with variants in the SERPINA1 gene) provides another example of a condition with an 
adult-onset phenotype where molecular testing cannot distinguish between childhood or adult onset. Likewise, 
preconception or prenatal genetic testing may not be appropriate for conditions, such as spinocerebellar ataxias 
(SCA) type 5 and familial malignant melanoma. Variants in the beta III spectrin gene (SPTBN2 gene) have been 
associated with SCA type 5. This is a relatively mild disorder that typically begins between the ages of 20 and 30 
and progresses slowly. CDKN2A, the most commonly identified gene variant in familial forms of melanoma 
(adulthood age of onset), exhibits incomplete penetrance. 
Cystic Fibrosis 
Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a hereditary disease that affects many organs throughout the body and most of the exocrine 
glands. As a result of the abnormal production of secretions, CF leads to organ and tissue damage, especially in the 
airways, liver, pancreas, intestines, sweat glands, and, in males, the vas deferens. While several organs and tissues 
are affected by CF, pulmonary disease remains the predominant cause of morbidity and mortality in individuals 
with CF. It has been estimated that approximately 1 in every 31 Americans is an asymptomatic carrier of the 
defective CF gene.  
CF results when an individual inherits a gene variant in both alleles of the CF transmembrane conductance 
regulator (CFTR) gene, located on chromosome 7q31. The CFTR gene produces a protein that functions as a 
chloride channel and regulates bicarbonate and chloride transport, as well as other transport pathways. More than 
1900 different variants in the CF gene have been identified. The prevalence of carrier frequencies and variant types 
varies among populations. Non-Hispanic whites of Northern European descent have a carrier rate of 1 in 25 with 
the ΔF508 variant being the most common. It has been estimated that amongst individuals of Ashkenazi Jewish 
descent, CFTR mutation carrier frequency is 1 in 24. When considered all together, the most common variants in 
this population (W1282X, ΔF508, G542X, 3849+10kb C>T, and N1303K) account for at least 94% of the CF 
cases. 
The clinical severity of CF symptoms is largely determined by the specific variants that an individual carries. Any 
individual who screens positive for CF should receive genetic counseling. Negative screening results reduce, but do 
not totally eliminate, the possibility that the individual is a CF carrier. A negative screening test only indicates that 
the individual does not carry any of the CF variants specifically tested for during the screening.  
Due to the high prevalence of carriers of CF, ACOG and ACMG recommend that DNA screening for CF be made 
available to all individuals seeking preconception or prenatal care regardless of personal or family history for the 
disease or carrier status (ACOG, 2017[a], 2017[b]). The NSGC recommends that carrier testing for CF be provided 
to women of reproductive age, regardless of ancestry. The NSGC also recommends that prior to conception, “CF 
carrier testing should also be offered to any individual with a family history of CF and to partners of mutation 
carriers and people with CF” (Langfelder-Schwind, 2014). 
Because so many different variants in the CF gene have been identified, it is impractical to test for every known 
variant. In 2001, the ACMG Accreditation of Genetic Services Committee compiled a standard screening panel of

25 CF variants to screen for CF in the U.S. population (Grody et al, 2001). This 25-mutation test incorporated all 
CF-causing variants with an allele frequency of greater than or equal to 0.1 % in the general U.S. population. The 
test also included variant subsets shown to be sufficiently predominant in certain ethnic groups, such as African 
Americans and Ashkenazi Jews. The ACMG recommended that this standard panel of variants be used to provide 
the greatest panethnic detectability that can be performed practically. In the 2004 guidelines on CF Population 
Carrier Screening, the ACMG recommended using a panel that contains, at a minimum, 23 of the most common CF 
variants (Watson, 2004). 
According to the NSGC, carrier testing panels should include the variants recommended by ACOG and ACMG. 
For individuals of non-Northern European descent, panethnic panels that include additional variants more 
commonly identified in minority populations are appropriate to consider. NSGC also recommends that general 
population screening practices focus on, “Identifying carriers of established disease-causing CFTR mutations” 
(Langfelder-Schwind, 2014).  
In a recent Consensus Opinion, ACOG stipulated that: 
Complete analysis of the CFTR gene by DNA sequencing is not appropriate for routine carrier screening. 
This type of testing generally is reserved for patients with cystic fibrosis, patients with negative carrier 
screening result but a family history of cystic fibrosis (especially if family test results are not available), 
males with congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens, or newborns with a positive newborn 
screening result when mutation testing (using the standard 23-mutation panel) has a negative result. 
Because carrier screening detects most mutations, sequence analysis should be considered only after 
discussion with a genetics professional to determine if it will add value to the standard screening that was 
performed previously (ACOG, 2017[b]). 
Spinal Muscular Atrophy 
Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is a disease characterized by muscle atrophy and weakness caused by the 
progressive degeneration and loss of the brain stem nuclei and the anterior horn cells in the spinal cord, (that is, the 
lower motor neurons). The onset of muscle weakness ranges from before birth to adolescence or young adulthood. 
The weakness is symmetrical and progresses from proximal to distal. Growth failure and poor weight gain, 
restrictive lung disease, scoliosis, joint contractures, and sleep difficulties are common complications (Prior, 2016). 
The age of onset of symptoms roughly correlates with the extent to which motor function is affected with the earlier 
the age of onset, the more profound the impact on motor function. Children who are symptomatic at birth or in 
infancy typically have the lowest level of function.  
SMA is caused by a variant in the survival motor neuron gene (SMN1). Due to the severity of the disease and the 
relatively high carrier frequency, there has been interest in carrier screening for SMA in the general prenatal 
population. Because the genetics of SMA are complex and due to, “Limitations in the molecular diagnostic assays 
available, precise prediction of the phenotype in affected fetuses may not be possible” (ACOG, 2017[b]).

2017[a], ACOG 2017[b]). The ACMG position statement on Carrier Screening for Spinal Muscular Atrophy also 
recommends panethnic screening for SMA (Prior, 2008). 
Rett Syndrome  
Rett syndrome is a disorder of the nervous system that leads to regression in development, especially in the areas of 
expressive language and hand use. In most cases, it is caused by a genetic variant on the X chromosome in the gene 
that contains instructions for creating methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MeCP2). Rett syndrome occurs almost 
exclusively in girls and may be misdiagnosed as autism or cerebral palsy. A child affected with Rett syndrome 
normally follows a standard developmental path for the first 5 months of life. After that time, development in 
communication skills and motor movement in the hands seems to stagnate or regress. After a short period, 
stereotyped hand movements, gait disturbances, and slowing of the rate of head growth become apparent. Other 
problems may also be associated with Rett syndrome, including seizures, disorganized breathing patterns while 
awake and apraxia/dyspraxia (the inability to program the body to perform motor movements). Apraxia/dyspraxia 
is a key symptom of Rett syndrome, and it results in significant functional impairment, interfering with body 
movement, including eye gaze and speech. 
 
Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy or Becker Muscular Dystrophy 
Muscular dystrophy (MD) refers to a diverse group of genetic diseases (disorders) characterized by a decrease in 
muscle mass over time, including progressive damage and weakness of facial, limb, breathing, and heart muscles. 
Some disorders within this group, referred to as dystrophinopathies, are categorized based on clinical features, 
(such as the age when signs are first seen), genetic (inheritance) pattern, the muscles affected, and muscle biopsy 
features. A major type of MD is Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) which is the most common form affecting 
children. DMD is an x-linked genetic disorder characterized by progressive muscle atrophy. This form of muscular 
dystrophy primarily affects the skeletal and cardiac muscles and occurs almost exclusively in males. In this 
condition, muscle weakness tends to appear in early childhood and worsen rapidly. Affected children may 
demonstrate delayed motor skills, such as sitting, standing, walking, and are usually wheelchair-dependent by 
adolescence. The onset of cardiomyopathy typically begins in adolescence (Genetics Home Reference, Duchenne 
and Becker muscular dystrophy, 2019). 
 
DMD is X-linked and penetrance is complete in males and can manifest in female carriers as weakness or 
cardiomyopathy. The gene that codes for dystrophin is the largest known human gene. A molecular confirmation of 
DMD is achieved by confirming the presence of a pathogenic variant in this gene by a number of available assays. 
A dystrophin gene alteration is implicated in a spectrum of X-linked muscle diseases, with overlapping clinical 
specifics and severity, resulting in a complex spectrum of dystrophinopathies. The clinical conditions within the 
spectrum include DMD, Becker muscular dystrophy (BMD), and DMD-associated cardiomyopathy. On December 
12, 2019, the FDA cleared for marketing the first biochemical screening test to aid in newborn screening for DMD.

Cerebral Autosomal Dominant Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy Syndrome 
(CADASIL) 
CADASIL syndrome is considered the most common form of familial vascular dementia and familial brain small 
vessel arteriopathy. In addition to typical signs and symptoms of CADASIL syndrome, (for example, migraine with 
aura, stroke, cognitive impairment/dementias, mood disturbances), many individuals with CADASIL also develop 
leukoencephalopathy, which is characterized by high intensity signal lesions and areas of cystic degeneration of 
subcortical white matter and basal ganglia, which becomes more visible on MRI as the disease progresses. Clinical 
symptoms typically progress slowly with the mean onset of symptoms usually seen by age 45. By age 65, most 
individuals with CADASIL will exhibit cognitive deficits and dementia. There is no known cure for CADASIL 
syndrome and no treatment with proven efficacy for CADASIL syndrome; medical treatment is directed at relief of 
the presenting symptoms. Antiplatelet treatment is frequently used, but has not been proven to be effective in 
CADASIL. Surgery is also utilized in some cases to repair defective blood vessels, due to the degenerative effects 
of CADASIL, as it progresses. Additional risk factors for stroke, if present, such as hypertension, hyperlipidemia, 
diabetes, blood clotting disorders, and obstructive sleep apnea, should also be treated. Smoking should be 
discouraged in individuals at risk for CADASIL syndrome.  
 
Genetic molecular testing, which is a method to determine the presence or absence of specific genetic variants on 
specific genes, has been proposed as a diagnostic aid in select individuals with moderate to high pretest likelihood 
of having CADASIL syndrome (based on symptoms), when other conventional diagnostic methods have yielded 
inconclusive or equivocal results. However, testing has no clinical utility, given that effective treatment options do 
not currently exist. Genetic testing for CADASIL, as part of preconceptional, preimplantation, and prenatal 
workups to determine carrier status and/or guide reproductive decisions when a pathologic NOTCH3 variant has 
been confirmed in a parent or other close relative, (that is, the proband) may be appropriate, given the pathological 
significance of the disease. Variants in the NOTCH3 gene have been consistently found on chromosome 19p13.2-
p13.1 and have been identified as the underlying cause of CADASIL syndrome in more than 90% of confirmed 
cases. The NOTCH3 protein consists of 2321 amino acids, which are primarily expressed in vascular smooth 
muscle cells and which have a role in the control of vascular transduction. Over 170 causative NOTCH3 variants 
have been reported in the 33 exons of the NOTCH3 protein. All CADASIL-causing variants have been seen in 
exons 2 to 24, which encode the 34 epidermal growth factor-like (EGFL) repeats, with strong clustering in exons 3 
and 4, which encode EGFL 2 to 5. This means that greater than 40% of NOTCH3 variants in greater than 70% of 
confirmed CADASIL cases have occurred in exons 2 to 24. The penetrance of sequence variants in the NOTCH3 
gene is believed to be nearly 100%. Genetic testing involves targeted sequence analysis of 1 to 23 exons where

known variants for CADSIL have been identified. Additional variants found on the NOTCH3 gene are of unknown 
significance at this time (Chabriat, 2009; Donahue, 2004; Lesnick Oberstein, 2003).  
 
Prothrombin-related Thrombophilia 
Thrombophilia (also known as hypercoagulability) is an inherited disorder of blood clotting that leads to the 
inappropriate formation of blood clots. In adults, this disorder most commonly manifests as venous 
thromboembolism (VTE), such as deep vein thrombosis (DVT) in the legs and pulmonary embolism (PE) in the 
lungs. In women, VTE may result in adverse pregnancy outcomes. It has been estimated that in the United States, 
approximately 300,000 to 600,000 individuals are affected by VTE annually. The predisposition to form clots may 
be caused by genetic factors, acquired changes in the clotting mechanism, or, more commonly, an interaction 
between genetic and acquired factors. Prothrombin (factor II) is a protein in blood that is essential for the formation 
of blood clots. In prothrombin-related thrombophilia, a specific change in the genetic code causes the body to 
produce an excessive amount of the prothrombin protein, which can result in excessive blood clotting. A common 
sequence variance of the prothrombin gene (G20210A) has been associated with elevations in plasma prothrombin 
levels and is a known risk factor for DVT and PE. The prothrombin G20210A variant, found almost exclusively in 
Caucasians, is the second most common genetic risk factor for venous thrombosis, and G20210A testing has been 
used as a tool to screen for, diagnose and manage prothrombin-related thrombophilia.  
 
According to Gene Reviews for Prothrombin-Related Thrombophilia (updated 2021), “The diagnosis of 
prothrombin thrombophilia is established in a proband by identification of a heterozygous or homozygous 
20210G>A variant (also known as c.*97G>A) in F2, the gene encoding prothrombin.”  
 
The following information is provided by Gene Reviews: 
No clinical features are specific for prothrombin thrombophilia. The diagnosis should be suspected in 
individuals with at least one of the following more specific findings: 
• A first unprovoked venous thromboembolism (VTE) before age 50 years; 
• A history of recurrent VTE; 
• Venous thrombosis at certain unusual sites such as the cerebral, mesenteric, portal, or hepatic veins; 
• VTE during pregnancy or the puerperium; 
• VTE associated with the use of estrogen-containing oral contraceptives or hormone replacement 
therapy (HRT); 
• An unprovoked VTE at any age in an individual with a first-degree family member with a VTE before 
age 50 years. 
 
Prothrombin thrombophilia testing may be considered in individuals who have less specific findings, 
including the following: 
• A history of unprovoked VTE considering discontinuation of anticoagulation; 
• A first VTE related to use of tamoxifen or other selective estrogen receptor modulators; 
• Age greater than 50 years with a first unprovoked VTE; 
• Neonates and children with non-catheter related idiopathic VTE or stroke.

The range of plasma concentrations of prothrombin in heterozygotes overlaps with the normal range. 
Therefore, plasma prothrombin concentration is not reliable for diagnosis. Molecular genetic testing 
approaches can include targeted analysis for the F2 20210G>A variant or a multigene panel that includes 
the analysis of the F2 variant and other genes of interest. Note: The genes included and sensitivity of 
multigene panels vary by laboratory and are likely to change over time (Kujovich, 2021). 
 
The 2018 American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) Clinical Practice Bulletin on Inherited 
Thrombophilias in Pregnancy does not recommend routine thrombophilia testing. They state that, “Screening for 
inherited thrombophilias is useful only when results will affect management decisions, and it is not useful in 
situations in which treatment is indicated for other risk factors.” They recommend targeted assessment for inherited 
thrombophilia in the following scenarios: 
 
• A personal history of VTE, with or without a recurrent risk factor, and no prior thrombophilia testing; 
• A first-degree relative (for example, a parent or sibling) with a history of high-risk inherited 
thrombophilia. 
 
Based primarily on consensus and expert opinion (Level C), ACOG also stipulates that, “Screening tests for 
inherited thrombophilias should include factor V Leiden mutation; prothrombin G20210A mutation; and 
antithrombin, protein S, and protein C deficiencies” (ACOG, 2018). 
 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (MTHFR) Gene Mutation Testing 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is an enzyme that plays a role in the processing of amino acids, the 
building blocks of proteins, and is important for a chemical reaction involving forms of the B-vitamin folate (folic 
acid or vitamin B9). The MTHFR gene provides instructions for making the MTHFR enzyme. The MTHFR 
enzyme is thought to have a role in homocysteine metabolism; the mutation is reported to reduce MTHFR activity, 
resulting in hyperhomocysteinemia. Polymorphisms or common variants (C677T and A1298C) in the MTHFR 
gene have been associated with an increased risk of homocysteinuria, and suggested as a possible risk factor for 
developing a variety of diseases and disorders. The potential associations between MTHFR genotype status and a 
number of medical complications have been evaluated using methodologies, such as case-control and cohort study 
designs, Mendelian randomization, and meta-analysis. MTHFR mutation testing is available for these disorders and 
has been suggested to assist in the screening, diagnosis, and management of individuals predisposed to thrombosis. 
Genetic testing for mutations in the MTHFR gene for inherited thrombophilia is available, however, the clinical 
utility has not been established in any randomized controlled trials or controlled clinical trials in which testing for 
thrombophilia, including hyperhomocysteinemia, was the primary intervention and recurrent VTE was the outcome 
measure (Cohn, 2013). There is limited evidence on the clinical utility of testing for MTHFR mutations in persons 
with VTE or at risk for VTE. Given the lack of available evidence, and lack of clinical utility for serum 
homocysteine testing in general, it is unlikely that MTHFR mutation testing would alter the management of therapy 
resulting in improved clinical outcomes.

At the current time, there is insufficient evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature and lack of 
support for MTHFR mutation testing from professional specialty society consensus guidelines establishing a 
definitive causal relationship between inherited thrombophilias and recurrent early pregnancy loss. The clinical 
utility of genetic testing for inherited thrombophilia disorders, including MTHFR mutation testing has not been 
established. The peer-reviewed published medical literature suggests MTHFR enzyme activity associated with 
hyperhomocysteinemia is not typically associated with pregnancy loss prior to 10 weeks gestation. Routine 
screening of all pregnant women is not recommended. Other evidence-based guidelines state the presence of 
inherited thrombophilia is an insignificant factor in determining the optimal duration of anticoagulation in 
individuals with VTE. It is not possible to define a clinical situation in which the benefit of MTHFR mutation 
testing outweighs the risks of anticoagulation given the low risk of VTE in some clinical situations. Additional 
studies are necessary to determine how MTHFR mutation testing impacts treatment decisions and how these 
treatments improve health outcomes. Evidence is lacking in the clinical utility of MTHFR testing for other 
conditions, including, but not limited to, cancer susceptibility, neural tube defects, Alzheimer’s disease, bone loss 
and fracture risk, diabetes, glaucoma, behavioral health and neuropsychiatric disorders, and in guiding drug therapy 
for any indication. 
 
Hereditary Pancreatitis 
Hereditary pancreatitis is a type of chronic pancreatitis. It is an autosomal dominant disease that is characterized by 
frequent attacks of epigastric pain with nausea and vomiting. Symptoms of hereditary pancreatitis can start after 
birth, but onset varies, and some people won’t show symptoms until adulthood. 
 
The majority of hereditary pancreatitis cases are associated with sequence variants in the protease, serine, 1 (trypsin 
1) gene (PRSS1). It is estimated that 65-80% of individuals with hereditary pancreatitis have mutations in the 
PRSS1 gene. When hereditary pancreatitis is caused by mutations in the PRSS1 gene, it is inherited in an autosomal 
dominant pattern. In some cases, an affected person inherits the PRSS1 gene mutation from one affected parent. 
Other cases result from new mutations in the gene and occur in people with no history of the disorder in their 
family. It is estimated that 20% of people who have the altered PRSS1 gene never have an episode of pancreatitis 
(this situation is known as reduced penetrance). It is unclear why some people with a mutated gene never develop 
signs and symptoms of the disease. Although rare, sequence variants in three other genes may show an increased 
risk for developing pancreatitis. These three genes are the serine peptidase inhibitor, Kazal type 1 gene (SPINK1), 
the chymotrypsin C (caldecrin) gene (CTRC), and the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (ATP-
binding cassette sub-family C, member 7) gene (CFTR), which is more commonly associated with cystic fibrosis. 
Some cases are caused by mutations in other genes, some of which have not been identified. 
 
In general, the clinical utility of genetic testing for hereditary pancreatitis has not been demonstrated as there is no 
evidence in the peer-reviewed published literature that treatment is changed by testing or that health outcomes are 
improved as a result of testing. Testing of at-risk relatives has not been shown to improve outcomes nor does it 
show that results of genetic testing alters the prevalence or course of the disease. The incidence of recurrent 
pancreatitis in children is not common. Consequently, the literature regarding genetic testing for hereditary 
pancreatitis in children is sparse, including small case series (Awano, 2013; Corleto, 2010; Dai, 2016; Terlizzi, 
2013). While there is a paucity of evidence and literature, there is consensus opinion that, in children with recurrent

Alzheimer’s disease (AD) 
AD is a progressive and age-related disease caused by unrelenting neurodegeneration and brain atrophy. 
Behaviorally, AD is characterized by progressive memory loss and cognitive decline. Pathologically, AD is 
characterized by local accumulations of amyloid β (Aβ) peptide and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) comprised of 
tau protein in the brain. At present, a definitive diagnosis of AD requires postmortem verification of Aβ deposits 
(plaques) and NFTs in the brain. In current clinical practice, a diagnosis of AD is based on clinical presentation, a 
detailed clinical history, cognitive screening tools and clinical diagnostic criteria (for example, the National 
Institute of Neurological and Communicative Disorders and Stroke-Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders 
Association [NINCDS-ADRDA] guidelines and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5
th
 
Edition [DSM-V]). 
 
AD is commonly associated with a family history; 40% of individuals with AD have at least one other afflicted 
first-degree relative. At present, the following four genes have been associated with AD and have been investigated 
as a possible diagnostic test: (1) Apolipoprotein E gene, (2) Amyloid Aβ precursor gene, (3) Presenilin 1 gene, and 
(4) Presenilin 2 gene. Genetic testing has been investigated both in individuals with probable AD and in 
asymptomatic family members.  
 
Early onset AD occurs before age 65 but can occur as early as age 30 years. Some families may show an autosomal 
dominant pattern of inheritance. Three genes have been identified by linkage analysis of affected families: amyloid 
Aβ precursor gene (APP), presenilin 1 gene (PSEN1), and presenilin 2 (PSEN2) genes. A variety of mutations 
within these genes have been associated with AD; mutations in presenilin 1 appear to be the most common. 
However, only 2-10% of those with AD have early onset AD, and genetic mutations have only been identified in 
30-50% of those individuals. Overall, identifiable genetic mutations are rare causes of AD.  
 
Chen and colleagues (2012) conducted a meta-analysis to evaluate the association of PSEN2 polymorphisms, 
rs8383 and 5’indel, with the risk of sporadic AD. Overall, the meta-analysis included six case-control studies for 
each polymorphism with 2186 confirmed AD cases and 2507 healthy controls in total. The analysis suggested a 
significant association between SNP rs8383 polymorphism and AD risk with no evidence of between-study 
heterogeneity or publication bias. In contrast, the authors did not find any evidence supporting the association 
between the 5’indel polymorphism and the risk of AD. The stratified analyses of apolipoprotein ε4 status or 
ethnicity also failed to reveal a statistically significant association between the 5’indel polymorphism of PSEN2 and 
AD risk. The authors concluded that PSEN2 rs8383 polymorphism is associated with an increased risk of sporadic 
AD. The authors also acknowledged that larger scale studies are needed to confirm these findings and to define 
potential gene-gene interactions.   
Based on the 2011 guidelines from the National Institute on Aging (NIA) and the Alzheimer’s Association (AA), 
the diagnosis of AD is a clinical diagnosis, focusing on the exclusion of other causes of senile dementia. However, 
ancillary imaging studies, such as computed tomography [CT], magnetic resonance imaging [MRI], single-photon

emission CT [SPECT], or positron emission tomography [PET]) and laboratory tests may be used. These tests help 
rule out other possible causes for dementia (for example, cerebrovascular disease, cobalamin [vitamin B12] 
deficiency, syphilis, and thyroid disease). According to the NIA-AA, the core clinical criteria for AD dementia will 
continue to be the foundation of the diagnosis in clinical practice, however, “Further studies are needed to prioritize 
biomarkers and to determine their value and validity in practice and research settings” (McKhann, 2011). 
In 2018, the NIA-AA published an updated biological definition of AD that focuses on the underlying pathological 
activities of the disease, which can be identified either in living individuals (via biomarkers) or during autopsy. The 
NIA-AA framework proposes using three groups of biomarkers (β amyloid deposition, pathologic tau, and 
neurodegeneration) that can be measured by obtaining spinal fluid and/or special radiological imaging tests. The 
new definition is intended for research purposes only (to identify and stage research participants) and is meant to 
provide a flexible framework amenable to new (yet to be discovered) biomarker tests. The definition is not intended 
to be used in routine clinical care, and further investigation is required to establish the role and utility of the 
biomarker definition (Jack, 2018). There is inadequate data to suggest that the addition of either genetic testing or 
biochemical markers improves the clinical diagnosis of AD. The majority of available studies focus on those with 
probable AD, for whom the clinical diagnosis has a sensitivity of 85%. There is inadequate data regarding the use 
of these tests in individuals with possible AD where the diagnosis is less certain. Additionally, there is no data to 
suggest that use of the above tests would change clinical management in terms of either altering the diagnostic 
work-up or therapy. There are currently no published data suggesting that either biochemical or genetic testing of 
individuals with possible or probable AD affects the conventional diagnostic work-up, treatment or clinical 
outcomes.  
 
CHARGE Syndrome 
CHARGE syndrome is a rare and complex genetic condition due to the wide range of tissues/systems affected by 
mutations in the chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein (CHD7) gene (Hsu, 2014). It occurs in about one in 
every 15-17,000 births (van Ravenswaaij-Arts, 2015). CHD7 is the only gene currently known to be associated with 
CHARGE syndrome. In rare cases, an affected person inherits the mutation from an affected parent.  
 
The term CHARGE comes from the first letter of some of the more common features seen in children with 
CHARGE syndrome which are: 
I = coloboma (usually retinochoroidal) and cranial nerve defects (80-90%);  
(H) = heart defects in 75-85%, especially tetralogy of Fallot;  
(A) = atresia of the choanae (blocked nasal breathing passages) (50-60%);  
(R) = retardation of growth (70-80%) and development;  
(G) = genital underdevelopment due to hypogonadotropic hypogonadism;  
(E) = ear abnormalities and sensorineural hearing loss (>90%).  
 
Four features are almost always present in those with the CHD7 mutation found in CHARGE syndrome: external 
ear anomalies, cranial nerve dysfunction, semicircular canal hypoplasia, and delayed attainment of motor 
milestones (Bergman, 2011). The established clinical criteria can provide a diagnosis of definite CHARGE

syndrome in many cases, but, due to associated variable phenotypes, some individuals may not have all the clinical 
features present and they are categorized as having possible or probable CHARGE syndrome. 
 
The typical combinations of clinical features seen in CHARGE syndrome are caused by autosomal dominant 
mutations in the CHD7 gene, which means one copy of the altered gene in each cell is sufficient to cause the 
disorder. Sequence analysis of the CHD7 coding region detects mutations in many individuals with CHARGE 
syndrome. Penetrance in those with CHD7 mutations is 100%, meaning that all persons who are heterozygous for a 
CHD7 mutation have some features of CHARGE syndrome. More than 500 specific CHD7 mutations associated 
with CHARGE syndrome have been identified (Kim, 2014). 
 
CHARGE syndrome is most often related to a new mutation in the CHD7 gene and occurs in persons with no 
family history of the disorder. In rare cases, an affected individual inherits the mutation from an affected parent. 
Some investigators (Hughes, 2014) have proposed that family history (any first-degree relative with at least one 
major feature of CHARGE) should be incorporated into the clinical diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome as a major 
diagnostic criterion. Most individuals diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome do not have an affected parent. In rare 
instances, one parent may have mild features, including more than one major characteristic, in addition to minor 
criteria, such as a cardiovascular malformation (Bergman, 2011). In some cases, a family history may appear 
negative for the syndrome because of failure to recognize mild features in family members. 
 
The risk to siblings of the proband depends on the genetic status of the proband’s parents. If a parent of the proband 
is affected or has a CHD7 mutation, the risk to the siblings of inheriting the mutation is 50%. If neither parent is 
affected, the risk to siblings of a proband is approximately 1%-2%, due to germline mosaicism. Because CHD7 
mutation typically occurs as the result of a new mutation, the risk to the siblings of a proband is slight. Severely 
affected individuals with CHARGE syndrome do not reproduce. Each child of a mildly affected individual with 
CHARGE syndrome has a 50% chance of inheriting the mutation. The severity of CHARGE syndrome in a parent 
does not predict the severity of CHARGE syndrome in the offspring. Variable expression has been observed in 
familial cases. 
 
Many cases of CHARGE syndrome can be diagnosed clinically using established criteria. However, mildly affected 
persons may only have one or a few of the features of CHARGE syndrome, which makes the determination of the 
diagnosis of CHARGE uncertain. The clinical diagnosis may also be difficult to determine if clinical features are 
overlapping with other syndromes. Confirming the diagnosis of CHARGE syndrome with genetic testing may lead 
to changes in clinical management for those with uncertain clinical features. Preimplantation, preconception or in-
utero genetic testing may be helpful to assist reproductive decision making if there is a family history of a first-
degree relative with CHARGE syndrome.  
 
Genetic testing for CHARGE syndrome is a laboratory-developed test and does not require FDA approval. Clinical 
laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory service. Such tests must meet 
the general regulatory standards of the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Act (CLIA). CHD7 is the only gene 
currently known to be associated with this syndrome. The clinical utility of making a definite diagnosis of 
CHARGE syndrome through genetic testing is high, in that confirming a diagnosis with genetic testing may lead to

Inherited Peripheral Neuropathies 
Charcot-Marie-Tooth (CMT) disease is actually a group of inherited neuropathies characterized classically by distal 
sensory loss and weakness, abnormal deep tendon reflexes, and skeletal abnormalities. The majority of inherited 
polyneuropathies are variants of CMT disease. The clinical phenotype of CMT is highly variable, ranging from 
minimal neurological findings to the classic picture with pes cavus and “stork legs” to a severe polyneuropathy with 
respiratory failure. More than 40 genes associated with CMT have been described, including autosomal dominant, 
autosomal recessive, X-linked dominant, and X-linked recessive forms. CMT type 1 (CMT1) is a demyelinating 
peripheral neuropathy characterized by progressive peripheral motor and sensory neuropathy, slow nerve 
conduction velocity, and enlarged nerves. CMT1 accounts for approximately 50% of all CMT. There are five genes 
that are currently associated with CMT1:  
1. peripheral myelin protein 22 (PMP22; CMT1A [common duplication] and CMT1E [point variants]);  
2. myelin protein zero (MPZ; CMT1B);  
3. lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor-alpha factor (LITAF; CMT1C);  
4. early growth response 2 (EGR2; CMT1D); and  
5. neurofilament protein, light polypeptide (NEFL; CMT1F). 
 
CMT1A accounts for 70% to 80% of CMT1, while CMT1B accounts for 5% to 10%; CMT1E and CMT1F each 
account for less than 5% of cases, and CMT1C and CMT1D each account for less than 2% of identified cases. 
Clinical genetic testing for CMT1 is available from several laboratories in the United States. The most commonly 
available genetic test is for the common 1.5-megabase duplication of the PMP22 gene associated with CMT1A, 
which is performed using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) or molecular methods. Genetic testing is also 
available from some laboratories for PMP22 point variants (CMT1E) and variants in EGR2, LITAF, MPZ, and 
NEFL by direct DNA sequencing. 
 
The American Academy of Neurology (AAN), American Association of Neuromuscular and Electrodiagnostic 
Medicine (AANEM), and the American Academy of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation (AAPMR) published an 
evidence-based review addressing the role of laboratory and genetic tests in the evaluation of distal symmetric 
polyneuropathies (England, updated 2022). This review determined that genetic testing is established as “Useful” 
for the accurate diagnosis and classification of hereditary polyneuropathies in individuals with a cryptogenic 
polyneuropathy who exhibit a classical hereditary neuropathy phenotype (Level A). This review also determined 
that genetic testing “May be considered” in subjects with cryptogenic polyneuropathy who exhibit a hereditary 
neuropathy phenotype (Level C). The guideline recommends that initial genetic testing should be guided by the 
clinical phenotype, inheritance pattern, and electrodiagnostic (EDX) features and should focus on the most common 
abnormalities which are CMT1A duplication/HNPP deletion, Cx32 (GJB1), and MFN2 mutation screening. 
However, the authors also concluded that there is insufficient evidence to determine the usefulness of routine 
genetic testing in cryptogenic polyneuropathy that does not exhibit a hereditary neuropathy phenotype (Level U)

(England, 2009). The authors of this guideline did not describe how the results of the genetic tests would be used to 
improve patient-specific clinical outcomes. The likelihood that genetic testing for the inherited peripheral 
neuropathies will alter treatment management is low because the diagnosis of an inherited peripheral neuropathy 
can generally be made clinically, and there is no specifically designated treatment strategy based on the genetic 
phenotype. As such, the clinical utility of a genetic confirmation of these disorders has not been demonstrated in the 
peer-reviewed literature at this time. 
 
Currently, treatment for CMT is generally symptomatic, including pain management, exercise, and orthotics or 
orthopedic surgery for severe foot and ankle problems. For this reason, confirming a molecular diagnosis of CMT 
does not affect the course of treatment for this disease. 
 
Long QT Syndrome and other Channelopathies 
Congenital long QT syndrome (LQTS) is an inherited phenotypic disorder characterized by the lengthening of the 
repolarization phase of the ventricular action potential (an abnormally long QT interval seen on 
electrocardiographic [EKG] tracings) and polymorphic ventricular tachycardia, which may lead to syncope and 
sudden cardiac death (SCD). Diagnostic criteria for LQTS have been established which focus on EKG findings, as 
well as clinical and family history. LQTS can be primary, when inherited or genetic, or secondary, when 
precipitated by numerous drugs, structural cardiac disease and other clinical conditions. Primary or 
congenital/inherited LQTS has been associated with hundreds of mutations in more than 10 genes that affect ion 
channels contributing to the cardiac action potential. Disorders resulting from ion channel dysfunction are known as 
channelopathies. Approximately 75% of individuals presenting with LQTS have an identifiable gene mutation 
(Ackerman, 2011). Congenital LQTS usually manifests before the age of 40 and may be suspected when there is a 
history of seizure, syncope, or SCD in a child or young adult with a prolonged QT interval, in the absence of 
structural cardiac disease. This may prompt genetic analysis to identify the presence of genetic mutations associated 
with cardiac channelopathies. A history of these occurrences or the confirmation of a gene mutation associated with 
cardiac channelopathies in a first-degree relative may prompt diagnostic scrutiny of other family members.   
 
The European Society of Cardiology Task Force on Sudden Cardiac Death first published a guidance document in 
2001 (Priori, et al) referring to genetic defects on one specific cardiac sodium channel gene (LQT3), which are 
associated with higher risk for SCD in LQTS. Subsequent research has identified specific sequence variants 
associated with LQTS. Migdalovich correlated gender-specific risks for adverse cardiac events with the specific 
location of mutations (pore-loop vs. non-pore-loop) on the KCNH2 gene in 490 males and 676 females with LQTS. 
They reported that males with pore-loop mutations had a greater risk of adverse events (hazard ratio [HR], 2.18; 
p=0.01) than males without pore-loop mutations but that this association was not present in females. Albert 
examined genetic profiles from 516 cases of LQTS included in six prospective cohort studies. The authors 
identified 147 sequence variations found in five specific cardiac ion channel genes and tested the association of 
these variations with SCD. Two common intronic variations, one in the KCNQ1 gene and one in the SCN5A gene, 
were most strongly associated with SCD in individuals of European ancestry. This research suggests that combined 
assessments of the individual’s clinical information and mutation-specific data from a known proband may be used 
for improved risk stratification of individuals considered at risk for life threatening cardiac events related to LQTS 
(Albert, 2010; Migdalovich, 2011). At least 12 types of LQTS have been identified, varying in part based on their

effect on the action potential, ion channel and genotype. There are three major types of LQTS: LGT1, LGT2 and 
LGT3, accounting for OVER 90% of LQTS (Schwartz, 2001). Gene specific therapy recommendations have been 
developed and gene testing can contribute to treatment choice (Ruan, 2008). 
 
In 2011, a Heart Failure Society of America/European Heart Rhythm Association (HRS/EHRA) Consensus 
Statement on the State of Genetic Testing for Channelopathies and Cardiomyopathies was issued (Ackerman, 2011) 
which included the following guidance: 
 
• A Class I recommendation (“is recommended”) was applied for genetic testing in index cases with a sound 
clinical suspicion for the presence of a channelopathy or a cardiomyopathy when the positive predictive 
value of a genetic test is high (likelihood of positive result > 40% and signal/noise ratio > 10 AND/OR 
when the genetic test result provides either diagnostic or prognostic information, or when the genetic test 
result influences therapeutic choices); 
• Screening of family members for the mutation identified in the proband of the family is recommended as a 
Class I recommendation when genetic testing leads to the adoption of therapy/protective measures/lifestyle 
adaptations;  
• Conversely, the authors have assigned a Class IIa recommendation when results of genetic testing are not 
associated with the use of therapeutic or protective measures but the results may be useful for reproductive 
counseling or instances in which genetic testing is requested by the patient who wants to know his/her 
mutation status. 
 
Regarding other channelopathies, such as short QT syndrome (SQTS) and Brugada syndrome (BrS), there are 
molecular genetic tests available for the targeted gene variants most commonly associated with these conditions. 
However, the low prevalence of these rare conditions and confounding factors, such as varying penetrance, 
genotype-phenotypic profiles, and risk stratification have resulted in inadequate data to demonstrate the clinical 
utility, validity, and sensitivity of this testing, to date. 
 
Genetic testing has been proposed to determine an individual’s predisposition to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy 
(HCM) among those persons considered to be at risk, due to confirmed HCM in a close family member. Familial 
HCM is the most common hereditary cardiac condition in the U.S. and is thought to be the most common cause of 
sudden cardiac death (SCD) in young athletes and others 35 years of age and younger. Developments in the field of 
genetic testing have led to identification of specific genetic mutations that are associated with high risk for HCM. 
Proponents of this testing suggest that identification of these mutations in at risk individuals may lead to improved 
clinical outcomes. 
 
In 2020, the ACC/AHA issued an updated Guideline for the Diagnosis and Treatment of patients with Hypertrophic 
Cardiomyopathy, which is considered a full guideline revision intended to replace the former Gersh, 2011 
guideline. This document provides a comprehensive guide to the evaluation and management of HCM in adults and 
children, which is based on the current evidence, including relevant studies and other specialty society guidelines. 
This document provided the following Class I recommendations for genetic testing (with Evidence Level: B):

• In patients with HCM, evaluation of familial inheritance, including a 3-generation family history, is 
recommended as part of the initial assessment; 
• In patients with HCM, genetic testing is beneficial to elucidate the genetic basis to facilitate the 
identification of family members at risk for developing HCM (cascade testing); 
• In patients with an atypical clinical presentation of HCM or when another genetic condition is 
suspected to be the cause, a work-up including genetic testing for HCM and other genetic causes of 
unexplained cardiac hypertrophy (“HCM phenocopies”) is recommended; 
• In patients with HCM who choose to undergo genetic testing, pre- and post-test genetic counseling by 
an expert in the genetics of cardiovascular disease is recommended so that risks, benefits, results, and 
their clinical significance can be reviewed and discussed with the patient in a shared decision-making 
process; 
• When performing genetic testing in an HCM proband, the initial tier of genes tested should include 
genes with strong evidence to be disease-causing in HCM (which currently includes MYH7, MYBPC3, 
TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, and ACTC1); 
• In first-degree relatives of patients with HCM, both clinical screening (ECG and 2D echocardiogram) 
and cascade genetic testing (when a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant has been identified in the 
proband) should be offered; 
• In families where a sudden unexplained death has occurred with a postmortem diagnosis of HCM, 
postmortem genetic testing is beneficial to facilitate cascade genetic testing and clinical screening in 
first-degree relatives; 
• In patients with HCM who have undergone genetic testing, serial reevaluation of the clinical 
significance of the variant(s) identified is recommended to assess for variant reclassification, which 
may impact diagnosis and cascade genetic testing in family members; 
• In affected families with HCM, preconception and prenatal reproductive and genetic counseling should 
be offered (Ommen, 2020). 
 
The high negative predictive value of genetic testing for HCM can be used to reduce follow-up screening in 
individuals who have a first degree relative with clinical findings of HCM and a genetic test which has strong 
evidence for pathogenicity when the individual being tested has no evidence of HCM. However, even an individual 
with a negative test can develop clinical disease due to, as yet, unidentified gene variants and de novo variants. For 
this reason, genetic counseling is necessary to make sure any individual to be tested understands the implications of 
the test and the uncertainty that often remains after the results are known. The positive predictive value of genetic 
testing for HCM remains of uncertain clinical value and the diagnostic utility of a positive result remains uncertain.  
More comprehensive evidence across different population groups and in larger numbers of individuals will 
continue to inform the practice community about the role of genetic testing, particularly in the heritable 
cardiomyopathies (Maron, 2012).

FTD is a degenerative condition characterized by focal atrophy of the frontal and anterior temporal lobes of the 
brain. It differs from other causes of dementia, such as Alzheimer’s, Lewy Body and Creutzfeldt Jakob’s diseases. 
FTD, formerly known as Pick’s disease, represents a clinically, neuropathologically and genetically heterogeneous 
group of progressive non-Alzheimer dementias characterized by progressive atrophy of the frontal and anterior 
temporal lobes of the brain. These neurodegenerative changes result in behavioral and language disturbances in the 
presence of intact memory and visuospatial functions. Three causative genes account for more than 80% of cases of 
FTD in families with a strong autosomal dominant family history: (microtubule-associated-protein-tau (MAPT), 
progranulin (PGRN), and chromosome 9 open reading frame 72 (C9orf72). Other possible causes of FTD which are 
being investigated include, but are not necessarily limited to, the valosin-containing protein (VCP), TAR DNA 
binding protein (TDP-43), charged multivesicular body protein 2B (CHMP2B), fused in sarcoma protein (FUS), 
presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and leucine-rich repeat kinase (Lrrk2). 
 
Other possible causes of FTD which are being investigated include, but are not necessarily limited to, the valosin-
containing protein (VCP), TAR DNA binding protein (TDP-43), charged multivesicular body protein 2B 
(CHMP2B), fused in sarcoma protein (FUS), presenilin-1 (PSEN1) and leucine-rich repeat kinase (Lrrk2). 
Diagnostic genetic testing is being explored as a means to identify symptomatic individuals with probable FTD as 
well as predictive genetic testing to identify FTD in asymptomatic individuals at risk for FTD. Preconceptional, 
preimplantation and prenatal genetic testing are being investigated as a means to determine carrier status and/or 
guide reproductive decisions when an FTD gene mutation has been confirmed in a parent or other close relative. 
Requests for prenatal diagnosis of (typically) adult-onset diseases are uncommon (Cohn-Hokke, 2012; Goldman, 
2012; Lindquist, 2009; Loy, 2014). The clinical manifestations of FTD significantly overlap with those of other 
inherited conditions including familial Parkinson disease and Alzheimer disease. This clinical overlap makes it 
difficult to determine which family has a genetic mutation associated with FTD by clinical presentation alone.  
 
Statin-induced Myopathy 
Statin drugs are the primary pharmacologic treatment for hypercholesterolemia and coronary artery disease (CAD) 
worldwide. Their use is associated with an approximate 30% reduction in cardiovascular events and they are the 
most commonly prescribed medications in the United States. It has been reported in clinical trials that 1% to 5% of 
subjects develop statin-associated muscle pain (myalgia), with approximately 1 in 1000 experiencing muscle 
degradation (myopathy), and 1.6 in 100,000 suffering from severe muscle damage with associated acute kidney 
injury (rhabdomyolysis). Myositis is much less common than myalgia, with an estimated per-person incidence of 
0.01%. These complications have been reported to negatively impact compliance, tolerability, and quality of life 
(QOL) in individuals taking statins (Harper, 2010; Ramsey, 2014; Stone, 2012). 
 
Genetic factors appear to increase the risk of statin-induced myopathy in certain populations. Clinical studies have 
demonstrated a statistical association between statin-induced myopathy and specific variations in the SLCO1B1 
gene. Additional studies have demonstrated that individuals who have inherited variations on the SLCO1B1 gene 
are significantly more likely to suffer myopathy as a side effect of statin medications. Inherited variations in the 
SLCO1B1 gene may result in reduced effectiveness of statin therapy and increased risk of myopathy. In particular, 
a genome-wide association study demonstrated that common variants of the SLCO1B1 gene significantly increased 
or decreased the risk of myopathy in individuals treated with simvastatin (Stewart, 2013).

The body of evidence regarding the use of genetic testing to assess the risk of statin-induced myopathy is sparse 
and of low quality. In particular, studies that evaluate the clinical validity and clinical utility of genetic testing for 
statin-induced myopathy are lacking. In 2018, the American College of Cardiology (ACC) and American Heart 
Association (AHA) in conjunction with several other professional organizations (Grundy, 2019) published updated 
clinical guidelines for the management of high blood cholesterol and related disorders. The guidelines 
recommended statin therapy as primary prevention for individuals with severe hypercholesterolemia and in adults 
40 to 75 years of age with either diabetes mellitus or at higher atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk. 
Throughout the guidelines, consistent attention is given to a clinician-patient risk discussion for making shared 
decisions regarding statin therapy. The guidelines do not include genotype testing as a recommendation for 
consideration in determining the safety and efficacy of statin-based therapy.

Catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT): An inherited cardiac channelopathy characterized 
by irregular heart rhythms brought on by physical exertion or intense emotion. CPVT may cause syncope (fainting), 
cardiac arrest, or SCD in affected individuals, resulting from a gene mutation. 
 
CHARGE syndrome: A rare genetic condition associated with multiple congenital anomalies. CHARGE is an 
abbreviation for several of the common features of this disorder, which are: coloboma (a gap in one of the 
structures of the eye), heart defects, atresia choanae (also known as choanal atresia and refers to complete blockage 
of one or both nasal passages), growth retardation, genital abnormalities, and ear abnormalities. The diagnosis is 
typically made based on clinical findings. The only gene currently known to be associated with this syndrome, 
chromodomain helicase DNA binding protein (CHD7), is present in most individuals with the condition. Clinical 
findings may be variable; however, the phenotype cannot be predicted from the genotype.

First-degree relative: Any relative who is a parent, sibling, or offspring of an individual. 
The National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  of the  National  Institutes  of  Health  (NIH)  defines  the  following 
terms in the context of potential transmission of inherited conditions associated with genetic mutations as follows: 
• First-degree relative: Any relative who shares approximately 50% of an individual’s genetic 
material, such as an individual’s parent (father or mother), full sibling (brother or sister), or 
offspring. 
• Second-degree relative: Any relative who shares approximately 25% of an individual’s genetic 
material, such as an individual’s grandparent, grandchild, uncle, aunt, niece, nephew, or half-
sibling. 
• Third-degree relative: Any relative who shares approximately 12.5% of an individual’s genetic 
material, such as an individual’s first cousin, great grandparent, great grandchild, great uncle, great 
aunt, half-uncle, half-aunt, half-niece, or half-nephew. 
 
Frontotemporal dementia (FTD): A broad term for a group of brain disorders  that primarily affect the  frontal and 
temporal lobes of the brain. 
 
Genetic molecular testing: A type of test that studies single genes or short lengths of DNA to determine the presence 
or absence of a specific gene variant or set of genetic variants to help diagnose a disease, screen for specific health 
conditions, and for other purposes. 
 
Genetic testing is done for predictive, diagnostic, prognostic or therapeutic indications as follows: 
• Predictive genetic testing involves use of a genetic test in an asymptomatic person to predict future risk of 
developing a certain disease. One of the limitations of predictive genetic testing is the challenge in 
interpreting positive test results, because some individuals who test positive for a disease-associated variant 
may never develop the disease. Predictive testing can identify variants that increase a person’s risk of 
developing disorders with a genetic basis, such as certain types of cancer. Targeted pre-symptomatic 
genetic testing can determine whether a person will develop a genetic disorder, such as hereditary 
hemochromatosis (an iron overload disorder), before any signs or symptoms appear. In order to be useful in 
the clinical setting, the results of predictive genetic testing should have a high positive predictive value, and 
evidence should demonstrate that such results improve either disease prevention or management, as 
compared with routine medical care without results of genetic testing. 
• Diagnostic genetic testing is used to identify or rule out a specific genetic or chromosomal condition. In 
many cases, genetic testing is used to confirm a diagnosis when a particular condition is suspected based on 
physical signs and symptoms. Diagnostic testing can be performed before birth or at any time during a 
person’s life, but is not available for all genes or all genetic conditions. The results of a diagnostic genetic 
test can influence a person’s choices about health care and the management of the disorder. 
• Prognostic genetic testing is used to assess the risk of progression and course in an asymptomatic 
individual not yet diagnosed with a disease, and as a means to forecast whether an individual diagnosed 
with a disease will have a serious or benign course (prognostic). For example, prognostic genetic testing,

when performed in persons with confirmed chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), helps to inform optimal 
disease management and also predicts survival and disease progression. 
• Therapeutic genetic testing (including, but not limited to, pharmacotherapeutics) involves the identification 
of a genetic variant that affects the way an individual responds to a therapeutic intervention. This 
application is often seen in the area of pharmacogenetic testing where genetic test results are used to inform 
treatment decisions with regards to how an individual is expected to respond to a particular drug therapy. 
 
Genome: An organism’s entire set of DNA.  
 
Genotype: The genetic structure (constitution) of an organism or cell.   
 
Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP): A neuromuscular disorder associated with 
deletions of the PMP22 gene. 
 
Homocysteine: A naturally occurring amino acid that, if present at a high level in the blood, can produce an 
increased risk of blood clots. This condition is known as hyperhomocysteinemia. It is believed that high blood 
levels of homocysteine can damage the lining of blood vessels. This damage is what can lead to blood clots. 
 
Hyperhomocysteinemia: A condition where an individual may get blood clots in either the veins (for example, DVT 
and pulmonary embolism) or arteries (for example, stroke and heart attack). In addition to making people prone to 
blood clots, hyperhomocysteinemia may also increase the risk of specific birth defects and other disorders. 
Common causes of hyperhomocysteinemia include kidney disease, lack of B vitamins (such as folate, vitamin B12, 
and vitamin B6) in the diet, hypothyroidism, alcoholism, and certain medications. 
 
Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM): This myocardial disorder is caused by mutation in one of the genes currently 
known to encode different components of the sarcomere. The disorder is characterized by left ventricular 
hypertrophy (LVH) in the absence of predisposing cardiac conditions, (for example, aortic stenosis) or 
cardiovascular conditions, (for example, long-standing hypertension). The clinical manifestations of HCM range 
from asymptomatic to progressive heart failure to sudden cardiac death and vary from individual to individual even 
within the same family. Common symptoms include shortness of breath (particularly with exertion), chest pain, 
palpitations, orthostasis, presyncope, and syncope. Most often the LVH of HCM becomes apparent during 
adolescence or young adulthood, although it may also develop late in life, in infancy, or in childhood. 
 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR): An enzyme (protein) that breaks down homocysteine. Deficiency 
of the MTHFR enzyme may cause hyperhomocysteinemia. 
 
Maturity-Onset Diabetes of the Young (MODY): A rare group of inherited diabetes conditions that occurs due to a 
primary  defect  in  pancreatic  beta  cell  function.  It  is  inherited  in  an  autosomal  dominant  pattern. Three  genes  are 
responsible for 90% of cases which are HNF1A, HNF4A and GCK. Symptoms usually present before the age of 25. 
 
Mutation (or variant):  A permanent change in the DNA code.

Clinical UM Guideline

Genetic Testing for Inherited Diseases 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.

Genetic Testing for Inherited Diseases 
 
Federal and State law, as well as contract language, and Medical Policy take precedence over Clinical UM Guidelines. We reserve the right to review and 
update Clinical UM Guidelines periodically. Clinical guidelines approved by the Medical Policy & Technology Assessment Committee are available for 
general adoption by plans or lines of business for consistent review of the medical necessity of services related to the clinical guideline when the plan performs 
utilization review for the subject. Due to variances in utilization patterns, each plan may choose whether to implement a particular Clinical UM Guideline. To 
determine if review is required for this Clinical UM Guideline, please contact the customer service number on the member's card. 
 
Alternatively, commercial or FEP plans or lines of business which determine there is not a need to adopt the guideline to review services generally across all 
providers delivering services to Plan’s or line of business’s members may instead use the clinical guideline for provider education and/or to review the medical 
necessity of services for any provider who has been notified that his/her/its claims will be reviewed for medical necessity due to billing practices or claims that 
are not consistent with other providers, in terms of frequency or in some other manner.
