Rationale 
 
Gene Panel Testing for Inherited Diseases 
The 2022 American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Clinical Statement for Inherited Retinal Degenerations 
recommends genetic testing be ordered at the initial visit for individuals with a suspected inherited retinal 
degenerative disease. The causative mutation can be identified in up to 60-80% of affected individuals, which can 
guide treatment decisions. The scope of genetic testing recommended varies, multi-gene testing may be necessary 
when there are multiple causative genes, while single gene analysis might be more appropriate for certain 
conditions. For diseases such as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA), which is caused by multiple different genes, it 
can be more efficient to order a single test which has been designed to specifically evaluate for all of the known 
causative genes (AAO, 2022). 
 
Advances in genetic testing technologies have led to the development and use of large-scale DNA sequencing, 
including but not limited to expanded carrier panels. Generally, carrier screening guidelines have focused on the 
assessment of individual conditions and ancestry. However, the effectiveness of this approach can be impacted by 
limited or inaccurate knowledge of ancestry and an increasingly multiethnic society. Approaches to screening have 
also been influenced by the recognition that while some genetic conditions occur more frequently in certain 
populations, genetic disorders are not limited to specific ethnic groups (Edwards, 2015).  
 
Due to limited knowledge about ancestry, individuals may be unaware of their reproductive risk of transmitting 
disorders to offspring. Expanded carrier screening panels may lead to prevention of disease in offspring or 
avoidance of unnecessary treatments. However, currently there is no data which demonstrates improved 
reproductive outcome. There is also no uniform or standardized process for best practice.  
 
According to the American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG): 
The completion of the full human genome sequence, followed by dramatic improvement in the 
speed and cost of DNA sequencing and microarray hybridization analysis, has enabled the 
ascertainment of an unprecedented quantity of disease-specific genetic variants in a time frame 
suited to prenatal/preconception screening and diagnosis. Now it is possible, using new 
technologies, to screen for mutations in many genes for approximately the same cost as 
previously required to detect mutations in a single gene or a relatively small number of 
population-specific mutations in several genes. Commercial laboratories have begun to offer such 
expanded carrier screening panels to physicians and the public, but there has been no professional 
guidance on which disease genes and mutations to include (Grody, 2013). 
 
The American College of Medical Genetics recommend carrier screening in individuals of Ashkenazi 
Jewish descent (Gross, 2008).

Genetic testing for cardiac ion channel mutations in persons with suspected channelopathies, such as long QT 
syndrome (LQTS) or hereditary cardiomyopathies, including hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is complicated by 
varying penetrance and genotype-phenotypic profiles. Testing often seeks to permit cascade screening of families; 
however, genetic testing using panels is not appropriate for an individual when a genetic mutation with strong 
evidence for pathogenicity has already been identified in a first-degree relative (proband) with a clinical diagnosis. 
Data supporting the clinical utility of gene panel testing for LQTS or hereditary cardiomyopathies is limited. 
Furthermore, a substantial proportion of individuals with hereditary cardiomyopathies or LQTS may have a variant 
of uncertain significance identified if a genetic testing panel is used. 
 
Gene Panel Testing for Cancer Susceptibility and Management 
Until recently, genetic testing for cancer susceptibility was generally carried out by direct sequencing (Sanger) 
which analyzes a specific gene for a particular mutation. However, next generation sequencing, (including but not 
limited to massively parallel sequencing and microarray testing) has made it possible to conduct panel testing 
which involves the analysis of multiple genes for multiple mutations simultaneously. Panel testing has the potential 
benefit of analyzing multiple genes more rapidly and thereby providing the results of the genetic work-up in a more 
timely fashion. However, the newer sequencing techniques may be associated with a higher error rate and lower 
diagnostic accuracy than direct sequencing which could affect the clinical validity of testing. Another potential 
drawback of the newer technologies is that they may provide information on genetic mutations which is of 
uncertain clinical significance. In assessing the value of a specific genetic testing panel for susceptibility to a 
particular malignant condition, consideration should be given to the peer-reviewed, published literature addressing 
the analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility of the test. Evidence demonstrating a positive impact of 
the panel on the care of individuals with, or at risk for, a specific cancer should be considered. Use of gene panels is 
considered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice to assess individuals at risk for 
Lynch syndrome (hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer) and breast cancer, and to evaluate certain individuals 
with prostate cancer (testing for homologous recombination repair [HRR] gene alterations), advanced non-small 
cell lung cancer, myelodysplastic syndrome, acute myeloid leukemia, and acute lymphoblastic leukemia. 
 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) last issued a policy statement update regarding genetic and 
genomic testing for cancer susceptibility in 2015. The findings and conclusions regarding the state of the 
technology are summarized as follows: 
 
• ASCO recognizes that concurrent multigene testing (i.e., panel testing) may be 
efficient in circumstances that require evaluation of multiple high-penetrance genes 
of established clinical utility as possible explanations for a patient's personal or 
family history of cancer. Depending on the specific genes included on the panel 
employed, panel testing may also identify mutations in genes associated with 
moderate or low cancer risks and mutations in high-penetrance genes that would 
not have been evaluated on the basis of the presenting personal or family history. 
Multigene panel testing will also identify variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) 
in a substantial proportion of patient cases, simply as a result of the multiplicity of 
genes tested. ASCO affirms that it is sufficient for cancer risk assessment to 
evaluate genes of established clinical utility that are suggested by the patient's 
personal and/or family history. Because of the current uncertainties and knowledge 
gaps, providers with particular expertise in cancer risk assessment should be 
involved in the ordering and interpretation of multigene panels that include genes

of uncertain clinical utility and genes not suggested by the patient’s personal and/or 
family history. 
• All of the challenges described here raise the possibility of harm to the individual 
undergoing panel-based testing, including the potential for inappropriate medical 
intervention and psychological stress resulting from the incidental identification of 
a mutation in a gene that was not suggested by family history or from aggressive 
management of moderate-penetrance mutations (or VUSs) that is not yet supported 
by evidence. 
• There remains an urgent need for more research into the implications of unexpected 
mutations in high-penetrance genes and mutations in moderate-penetrance genes. 
Continued research is also necessary to resolve VUSs. ASCO recognizes the 
complexity of the analysis and interpretation of genetic tests. ASCO supports high-
quality standards to help providers and patients understand the accuracy, benefits, 
and limitation of genetic tests from individual laboratories. ASCO believes that 
current regulation of tests to detect inherited genetic variants is insufficient. Where 
tests are considered laboratory-developed or commercial tests, ASCO supports a 
risk-based approach to US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulation. High-
risk tests used to identify patients who are at increased risk for cancer should be 
subject to regulatory review. ASCO also recognizes that regulation must be 
designed in a manner that does not compromise innovation or limit patient access 
to testing. 
• ASCO supports the development of a rapid approval pathway for tests that address 
an unmet medical need, with the understanding that more than one test should be 
available before such a need is considered to have been met (Robson, 2015). 
 
Colorectal Cancer Susceptibility 
Various laboratories offer next-generation sequencing panels (including but not limited to massively parallel 
sequencing, and microarray testing), making it possible to conduct panel testing which involves the analysis of 
multiple genes for multiple mutations simultaneously. The ColoNext™ test (manufactured by Ambry Genetics), 
which tests for variants in 17 genes, is one such example. Of the 17 genes tested, 12 are considered by the 2023 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network
©
 (NCCN) guideline on genetic/familial high-risk assessment for 
colorectal cancer to have well-established evidence of association with colorectal risk. The guideline notes that 
evidence is well-established for the following colorectal genes that are commonly included in gene panels: APC, 
BMPR1A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, MUTYH biallelic pathogenic variants, PMS2, PTEN, SMAD4, 
STK11 and TP53. 
 
Lynch syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder that is caused by a germline mutation in one of several DNA 
mismatch repair genes or loss of expression of MSH2 due to deletion in the EPCAM gene (previously called 
TACSTD1). The mismatch repair (MMR) genes that are associated with Lynch syndrome include: 
• MLH1 (MutL homolog 1), which is located on chromosome 3p22.2 
• MSH2 (MutS homolog 2), which is located on chromosome 2p21-16 
• MSH6 (MutS homolog 6), which is located on chromosome 2p16.3 
• PMS2 (postmeiotic segregation 2), which are located on chromosome 7p22.1

The 2023 NCCN guideline on genetic/familial high-risk assessment for colorectal cancer recommends that testing 
for Lynch syndrome (EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 sequence analysis) includes individuals who 
meet the Bethesda guidelines, the Amsterdam II criteria, who have a cancer diagnosis prior to age 50, or have a 
predicted risk for Lynch syndrome greater than 5% on one of the following prediction models: MMRpredict, 
MMRpro or PREMM5. Use of targeted gene panels that include EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2 is 
considered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. 
 
Breast Cancer Susceptibility 
Multi-gene testing for hereditary forms of cancer can analyze a set of genes which are associated with a specific 
family cancer type. Multi-gene panel testing can impact medical management and can provide an association for 
prediction of risk of breast cancer. However, not all genes tested show a strong association for breast cancer. It’s 
important to define which genes are most useful clinically as not all genes available on multi-gene tests will change 
risk management based on other risk factors such as family history.  
 
In the 2023 NCCN guidelines  for genetic/familial high-risk assessment: breast, ovarian, and pancreatic, 
recommendations are made for genetic panel testing using these genes ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, CHEK2, 
PALB2, and CDH1.  
 
Study among cancer susceptibility genes and breast cancer risk continues. Two case-control studies have been 
published which analyzed various genes which are susceptible for breast cancer risk. A 2021 study by Dorling and 
colleagues looked at a panel of 34 susceptible genes from samples of 60,466 individuals with breast cancer and 
53,461 controls from 25 countries. The objective was the estimated odds ratios for breast cancer overall and tumor 
subtypes. Using the Cancer Risk Estimates Related to Susceptibility (CARRIERS) population-based studies of 
breast cancer in the United States, Hu and colleagues (2021) reported on 17 studies and analyzed 28 genes 
(predisposed to cancer) in 32,247 participants (case group) with breast cancer compared to 32,544 unaffected 
participants (control group). The objective was the association between variants in each gene and risk of breast 
cancer. Significant associations between breast cancer and variants in 8 genes: ATM, BARD1, BRCA1, BRCA2, 
CHEK2, PALB2, RAD51C, and RAD51D were found in both studies. Of note, several genes regarded as having 
strong evidence of an association with breast cancer risk, for example, CDH1, PTEN, STK11, and TP53, are very 
rare and did not show a significant association, presumably given their low prevalence. The majority of mutations 
among case subjects were BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2, and among controls, CHEK2 and ATM, reflecting the 
higher and lower penetrance of the genes respectively. BRCA1, BRCA2, and PALB2 are associated with a high 
risk of breast cancer (with odds ratios ranging from 5.0 to 10.6 in the study by Dorling et al.), and mutations in 
CHEK2 and ATM are associated with a moderate risk (with odds ratios ranging from 2.1 to 2.5). Use of targeted 
gene panels ) is considered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. 
 
Management of HPV-related Cancers 
Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is a sexually transmitted virus that is associated with condyloma 
acuminatum, squamous intraepithelial lesions, as well as malignancy, including anogenital malignancies (cervical, 
vaginal, vulval, penile, and anal carcinoma) and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC) of the head and 
neck. HPV-associated head and neck cancers occur primarily in the tonsils, soft palate, or base of tongue.  
 
The NavDx test is a commercially available circulating tumor HPV DNA (ctHPVDNA) test designed to aid in the 
detection of HPV-related cancer. Chera and colleagues (2020) reported the results of a prospective study in which 
115 participants with nonmetastatic HPV-associated (p16-positive) OPSCC were treated with definitive 
chemoradiation therapy (CRT). The participants underwent a 3-month post-CRT positron emission tomography

ctHPVDNA surveillance. After a median follow-up time of 23 months (range, 6.1-54.7 months), 15 subjects (13%) 
developed disease recurrence. Eighty-seven participants had undetectable ctHPVDNA at all post-treatment time 
points, and none developed recurrence (NPV, 100%; 95% CI, 96% to 100%). A total of 28 subjects developed a 
positive ctHPVDNA during post-treatment surveillance, 15 of whom were diagnosed with biopsy-proven 
recurrence. Sixteen subjects had two consecutively positive ctHPVDNA blood tests, 15 of whom developed biopsy-
proven recurrence. The NPV of ctHPVDNA for detecting disease recurrence was 100%; the PPV for recurrence of 
two consecutive positive tests was 94% (95% CI, 70% to 99%). 
 
O’Boyle and colleagues (2022) conducted a prospective observational study to assess whether the clearance 
kinetics of ctHPVDNA is associated with postoperative disease status. The study included a total of 33 subjects 
with HPV+OPSCC undergoing surgery. Blood was collected prior to surgery, on postoperative days 1 (POD 1), 7, 
and 30 and with follow-up. A subcohort of 12 participants underwent frequent blood collections in the first 24 
hours after surgery to define early clearance kinetics. Plasma was analyzed using custom droplet digital polymerase 
chain reaction (ddPCR) assays for HPV genotypes 16, 18, 33, 35, and 45. In subjects with no pathologic risk factors 
for recurrence who were observed after surgery, ctHPVDNA rapidly decreased to < 1 copy/mL by POD 1 (n=8/8). 
In participants with risk factors for macroscopic residual disease, ctHPVDNA was markedly elevated on POD 1 (> 
350 copies/mL) and remained elevated until adjuvant treatment (n=3/3). Participants with intermediate POD 1 
ctHPVDNA levels (1.2-58.4 copies/mL) all possessed pathologic risk factors for microscopic residual disease 
(n=9/9). POD 1 ctHPVDNA levels were greater in subjects with known adverse pathologic risk factors such as 
extranodal extension > 1 mm (p=0.0481) and with increasing lymph nodes involved (p=0.0453) and were further 
associated with adjuvant treatment received (p=0.0076). One of 33 subjects had a recurrence that was detected by 
ctHPVDNA 2 months earlier than clinical detection.  
 
In 2022, Berger and colleagues published a retrospective case series with 1076 individuals who had received 
treatment for primary HPV-driven OPSCC and were at least 3 months post-treatment. Eligibility criteria also 
included having undergone at least one ctHPVDNA test at least 3 months post-treatment as part of routine 
surveillance. A total of 80 of the 1076 (7.4%) individuals had at least one positive ctHPVDNA test during follow-
up. Nearly half, 38, of the 80 individuals were tested more than 12 months after completion of therapy, 27 (34%) 
were tested between 6 and 12 months post-treatment and 15 (19%) were tested between 3-6 months post-treatment. 
Of these 80 individuals, 21 (26%) were known to have recurrent disease at the time of ctHPVDNA testing. Of the 
remaining 59 individuals, 55 (93%) were identified as having recurrent disease on subsequent imaging or biopsy. 
Thus, the PPV of the ctHPVDNA test was 76/80 (95%) for identification of recurrent disease at least 3 months 
post-treatment. A total of 1256 ctHPVDNA tests were negative. Ordering physicians indicated that 58 of these 
1256 individuals (4.6%) had active disease at the time the test was ordered. Over half (683, 57%) of individuals 
with negative tests were more than 12 months post-treatment, 282 (24%) were between 6 and 12 months post-
treatment and 233 (19%) were between 3 and 6 months post-treatment. Overall, the NPV of the ctHPVDNA test 
was 1198/1256 (95%) for identification of recurrent disease at least 3 months post-treatment. It is worth noting that 
ctHPVDNA were done at varying amounts of time post-treatment. Limitations of this study include that it was 
retrospective, uncontrolled and did not evaluate the impact of testing results on patient management or health 
outcomes. Additional studies are needed that demonstrate that the results of such testing results in improved 
measurable outcomes of patient management, compared to decisions independent of test results.

Management of Prostate Cancer 
In 2020, the FDA updated the label for Lynparza (Olaparib), a poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitor, to 
include individuals with deleterious or suspected deleterious germline or somatic HRR gene-mutated metastatic-
resistant prostate cancer who have progressed following previous treatment and for therapy based on an FDA-
approved companion diagnostic test for Lynparza. The label was updated again in 2021 with no change to the 
above recommendation. This approval was based on the PROfound trial (NCT02987543). In 2020, de Bono and 
colleagues reported on a randomized, open-label, phase 3 trial which evaluated the use of olaparib in individuals 
with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer with disease progression while receiving a hormonal agent. All 
participants had a tumor mutation in one of the genes involved in the homologous recombinant repair (HRR) 
pathway. Participants were divided into two cohorts; cohort A included 245 participants who had at least one 
alteration in BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM. Cohort B included 142 participants who had alterations in any of the other 
12 prespecified genes (BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PALB2, PPP2R2A,RAD51B, 
RAD51C, RAD51D and RAD54L). Primary endpoint was progression-free survival in cohort A. Participants were 
randomized in a 2:1 fashion to receive either olaparib or hormonal agent (control). The authors report that in cohort 
A, progression-free survival was a median of 7.4 months for those taking olaparib compared to a median of 3.6 
months in the control group. Median overall survival in cohort A was 18.5 months for those taking olaparib 
compared to a median overall survival of 15.1 months in the control group. The final analysis of overall survival 
was reported by Hussain and colleagues (2020). In cohort A, median duration of overall survival was 19.1 months 
with olaparib and was 14.7 months in the control group. In cohort B, median duration of overall survival was 14.1 
months with olaparib and 11.5 months in the control group. The overall population (cohorts A and B) had a median 
duration of overall survival of 17.3 months for those taking olaparib and 14.0 months for those in the control group. 
The study authors note that the role of PPP2R2A could not be validated as a homologous recombination repair gene 
based on preclinical data and there was no benefit of overall survival with treatment of olaparib over control 
therapy in the individuals who had alterations in PPP2R2A. The FDA label also notes that while individuals with 
gene mutations for PPP2R2A were enrolled in the trial, Lynparza is not indicated for those with this gene mutation 
due to unfavorable risk-benefit. 
 
In addition to Olaparib, several other PARP inhibitors have been evaluated in treating men with metastatic prostate 
cancer and a pathogenic variant in an HRR gene (or genes involving DNA damage response pathways), including 
Rucaparib, Niraparib, and Talazoparib. 
 
Management of Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
Gene alterations have been identified which can impact selection of therapy. Testing of specimens for gene 
alterations can help identify potentially effective targeted therapy and avoid therapy unlikely to provide clinical 
benefit. In the 2023 NCCN guideline for non-small cell lung cancer, molecular testing is recommended for 
actionable biomarkers (with these specified genes ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, MET, NTRK, 
RET and ROS1) prior to administering first-line therapy. It is also recommended that when feasible, “testing be 
performed via a broad, panel-based approach, most typically performed by NGS.” The NCCN also acknowledges 
that many NGS-based assays are larger than the 50-gene limit threshold, and as a result, it may be practical to 
follow these recommendations. Use of targeted gene panels is considered in accordance with generally accepted 
standards of medical practice. 
 
Guardant360 Panel Tests 
In a single-center observational study, Thompson and colleagues (2016) examined the concordance between tissue 
biopsy samples and Guardant360 blood samples for individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). A total 
of 102 subjects with a diagnosis of NSCLC or suspected NSCLC were included in the study. Tissue samples (n=50)

were processed using the Illumina TruSeq Amplicon 47 gene cancer panel (n=38) or the 20 gene Penn Precision 
Panel (n=12). For the 50 subjects who had both blood and tissue tests, the overall concordance was 60%. For EGFR 
mutations, the overall concordance was 79%. The authors concluded that ctDNA testing has potential for real-time 
molecular monitoring for individuals with advanced cancer.  
 
McCoach and colleagues (2018) performed a retrospective cohort study to determine the clinical utility of 
Guardant360 for detecting anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) fusions in NSCLC during diagnosis or during 
treatment with ALK inhibitors. The researchers included 88 subjects with 96 plasma-detected ALK fusions from 
the Guardant360 de-identified database. Subjects were separated into 4 cohorts: cohort 1 (n=42) contained subjects 
with a newly discovered ALK fusion, cohort 2 (n=31) contained subjects with a known or presumed ALK fusion 
and whose cell-free DNA (cfDNA) was obtained at progression, cohort 3 (n=13) contained subjects without 
additional clinical information, and cohort 4 (n=6) contained subjects who had been treated with anti-EGFR 
targeted therapy and found to have an ALK fusion by cfDNA. In cohort 1, the Guardant360 test found an ALK 
fusion in 16 subjects who had been reported as tissue-negative or tissue insufficient. Of the 42 subjects in the 
cohort, 10 had tissue samples available (5 ALK-positive, 5 ALK-negative), 11 had insufficient samples, and 21 did 
not have ALK information available. For the 5 subjects who were identified by Guardant360 as ALK-positive 
despite negative tissue biopsies, 3 eventually responded to ALK inhibitor therapy while clinical data was not 
available for the other 2 subjects. For cohort 2, 16 samples contained 1-3 ALK resistant mutations. For 5 samples, 
an ALK kinase domain mutation was identified in cfDNA despite the ALK fusion not detected in cfDNA and the 
prior tissue sample showing an ALK fusion. For cohort 3, the clinical status was unknown and no resistance 
mutations or bypass pathways were identified. For cohort 4, 6 subjects were found to have ALK fusions. The 
authors concluded that cfDNA NGS testing is an “additional tool” for detecting alterations, resistance mutations, 
and bypass pathways. Limitations of the study included the retrospective design and lack of clinical data for some 
subjects. The authors noted that tissue evaluation was at the providers’ discretion and the testing method was not 
available for all subjects. Furthermore, no sensitivity or specificity information was provided. 
 
Aggarwal and colleagues (2018) conducted a single-center, prospective study to assess mutation detection using 
Guardant360 for individuals with stage IV NSCLC. A total of 323 participants had Guardant360 plasma testing as 
part of clinical management. The primary outcomes were targetable alterations detected with plasma and tissue 
next-generation sequencing, the association between allele fractions of mutations detected in tissue and plasma, and 
the association of response rate with the plasma allele fractions of the targeted mutations. For 113 individuals, 
therapeutically targetable mutations were detected in EGFR, ALK, MET, BRCA1, ROS1, RET, ERBB2, or BRAF. 
Of 94 participants who had plasma testing alone, 31 had a targetable mutation detected and were considered to not 
need tissue biopsy. For the 229 participants who had concurrent plasma and tissue testing or were not able to have 
tissue testing, an additional 35 targetable mutations were detected. For those who received targeted therapy based 
on the plasma result, 36 out of 42 participants had complete/partial response or stable disease. Of the 128 subjects 
with concurrent plasma and tissue next generation sequencing results, 8 therapeutically relevant mutations were 
found in plasma only, 31 were detected in both plasma and tissue, and 16 were detected in tissue only, with an 
overall concordance of 81.3%. Therapeutically targetable mutation detection was highest for individuals with liver 
metastases (100% concordance with tissue [n=13]) compared with individuals with M1a disease (46.2% 
concordance). Based on the level of discordance found in the study, the authors note that “a tissue biopsy remains 
essential for initial cancer diagnosis”; however, in the setting of inadequate tissue DNA, “plasma NGS can be an 
adequate surrogate for molecular profiling.” The study was limited by a single-center design, potential user bias, 
and the consideration of plasma testing at a single point. The study was also enriched with individuals who 
underwent testing after progression to detect resistance mutations, which likely increased the frequency of 
individuals with EGFR T790M. The long-term outcomes of employing Guardant360 plasma testing in the clinical

management of stage IV NSCLC versus, or in conjunction with standard tissue biopsy remains uncertain, as does 
the potential risk of false-negative results. 
 
Leighl and colleagues (2019) reported on the multicenter, prospective NILE (Non-invasive versus Invasive Lung 
Evaluation) study, which aimed to assess the clinical utility of Guardant360 for the identification of eight genomic 
biomarkers (EGFR, ALK, ROS1, BRAF V600E, RET, MET, MET exon 14, ERBB2 [HER2]) in individuals with 
newly diagnosed metastatic NSCLC. A total of 307 individuals were enrolled with biopsy-confirmed, previously 
untreated non-squamous NSCLC (stage IIIB/IV) and tissue genotyping (genomic testing and PD-L1 expression 
analysis using next generation sequencing polymerase chain reaction “hotspot” testing, FISH and/or IHC, or Sanger 
sequencing). Participants submitted a pre-treatment blood sample for Guardant360 testing. A total of 282 
individuals met all inclusion criteria and were included in the final analysis. Tissue genotyping for all eight 
biomarkers was completed in 51 individuals (18.1%) (the majority of individuals had sequential individual 
biomarker testing, and did not undergo physician-directed sequencing of all eight genomic biomarkers), and 
Guardant360 testing for all eight biomarkers was completed in 268 individuals. One of eight biomarkers was 
identified in tissue samples in 60 individuals compared to 77 individuals with Guardant360 (p<0.0001). For 60 
individuals with tissue-positive results, one of the eight biomarkers was identified in tissue alone (n=12) but not 
with Guardant360, a false-negative rate of 20%. In regards to these 12 individuals, the researchers note: “the lack of 
full genomic assessment obtained by comprehensive cfDNA genomic profiling may have led to the patient being 
treated with a less efficacious therapy.” While the primary objective to demonstrate non-inferiority of Guardant360 
compared to tissue-based genotyping was achieved, the study was limited in that only 18% of participants received 
comprehensive tissue genomic profiling. As with other research on the topic, a substantial number of false-negative 
results were obtained by cfDNA, which can lead to undertreatment. 
 
Zugazagoitia and colleagues (2019) evaluated the ability of the Guardant360 test to identify individuals with 
NSCLC in routine clinical practice who have tyrosine-kinase inhibitor (TKI) resistance. This was a prospective 
study that included 53 individuals with EGFR, ALK or ROS1-altered advanced stage NSCLC who experienced 
progression (clinical or radiological) on prior TKI therapy. The sample was divided into 3 subgroups; 1) EGFR-
mutant NSCLC with resistance to first/second-generation EGFR TKI (cohort 1, n=31); 2) EGFR T790 + NSCLC 
with osimertinib resistance (cohort 2, n=15) and ALK/ROS1-rearranged NSCLC with resistance to crizotinib 
and/or next generation ALK/ROS1 TKI (cohort 3, n=7). Individuals with sufficient tumor DNA shedding such that 
plasma findings could be adequately interpreted were classified as “shedders”. In cohort 1, 20 individuals (65%) 
were classified as shedders and 9 (29%) were found to have EGFR T790 M mutations with Guardant360 testing. In 
2 additional individuals, EGFR T790 M mutations were identified by another method; these 11 individuals received 
subsequent osimertinib therapy. In cohort 2, Guardant360 testing in 10 individuals were classified as shedders and, 
in 9 of these, at least 1 pathologic alteration in addition to the EGFR sensitizing and/or T790M mutation was 
detected. None of the individuals in cohort 2 received subsequent targeted therapies. In cohort 3, which included 
only 7 individuals, 4 individuals were shedders and were found to have actionable alterations. Two individuals in 
cohort 3 received subsequent treatment informed by Guardant360 testing. A substantial number of individuals in 
the study were not considered to be tumor DNA shedders and this study did not compare outcomes in individuals 
managed with and without the Guardant360 test. 
 
The correlation between tissue-based tumor mutation burden (tTMB) testing and blood-based TMB (bTMB) testing 
was examined using data from the MYSTIC phase 3 randomized trial of first-line treatment with durvalumab, with 
or without tremelimumab versus platinum-based chemotherapy (Rizvi, 2020). tTMB testing was done using the 
FoundationOne tissue platform and bTMB testing used the Guardant OMNI platform. Among 352 study 
participants with matched tissue and blood samples (31.5% of individuals in the randomized study), results of the

two types of samples were correlated (Spearman p=0.6, Pearson r=0.7). A bTMB of at least 20 mutations/megabase 
(mut/Mb) was associated with improved OS for durvalumab plus tremelimumab versus chemotherapy. A tTMB of 
at least 10 mut/MB was associated with longer OS in both of the immunotherapy groups versus chemotherapy. 
 
Myelodysplastic Syndromes 
Myelodysplastic syndromes are conditions that can occur when the cells in bone marrow are abnormal and have 
problems making new blood cells. It is considered to be a type of cancer. Researchers have found that mutations in 
certain genes are disease-related and can be presumptive of myelodysplastic syndromes. The 2023 NCCN guideline 
for myelodysplastic syndromes notes the following genes are frequently somatically mutated in myelodysplastic 
syndromes: ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, NRAS, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, and 
ZRSR2. The NCCN does not address panel testing for relapsed myelodysplastic syndromes. Use of targeted gene 
panels is considered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. 
 
Acute Myeloid Leukemia 
Acute myeloid leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. It can move into the bloodstream and 
spread to other parts of the body including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system, and testicles. 
There are several gene variants which are associated with specific prognosis for AML. The 2023 NCCN guidelines 
for acute myeloid leukemia recommend testing for ASXL1, BCR-ABL, c-KIT, CEBPA (biallelic), FLT3-ITD, 
FLT3-TKD, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, PML-RAR alpha, RUNX1, and TP53. The NCCN guidelines also recommend all 
individuals “should be tested for mutations in these genes and multiplex gene panels and comprehensive next-
generation sequencing (NGS) analysis are recommended for the ongoing management of AML and various phases 
of treatment” (NCCN, 2023). Use of targeted gene panels) is considered in accordance with generally accepted 
standards of medical practice. 
 
Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia is a type of cancer that starts in the bone marrow. It can progress quickly and 
develops from immature forms of white blood cells. It can move into the bloodstream and spread to other parts of 
the body including the lymph nodes, liver, spleen, central nervous system, and testicles. The 2022 NCCN 
guidelines for acute lymphoblastic leukemia recommend testing for ABL1, ABL2, CRLF2, CSF1R, FLT3, IL7R, 
JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, PDGFRB, and SH2B3. Information regarding these gene variants may aid in risk 
stratification. The NCCN does not address panel testing for relapsed ALL. Use of targeted gene panels is 
considered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical practice. 
 
Unselected Population Screening  
As part of a population health study targeting Nevada’s diverse demographics (the Healthy Nevada Project), 
Grzymski and colleagues (2020) reported on the genetic risk and disease manifestation of three inherited autosomal 
dominant conditions: BRCA-related hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and familial 
hypercholesterolemia. With a cohort of 26,906 participants, the authors identified 214 unique pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic variants carried by 358 individuals (1.33%). Of the 273 carriers with medical records available for 
review, 60 participants were identified as having clinical disease relevant to the underlying carrier status (21.9%). 
There were 135 individuals with hereditary breast and ovarian cancer with records available which revealed 28 
individuals with disease who were also carriers (20.7%) compared with 523 individuals with disease who were not 
carriers (2.6%). Records were available for 66 individuals who were carriers of Lynch syndrome. A diagnosis of 
colon or other cancer was found in 19 participants (28.8%). The prevalence in non-carriers was 0.5% (92 
individuals with disease). The records of 73 individuals with familial hypercholesterolemia were reviewed. The 
prevalence of hyperlipidemia in carriers was 53.4% compared to 25.7% in non-carriers. Net health outcomes were

not assessed. While these results suggest genetic screening for certain conditions has potential in identifying at-risk 
carriers not detected in medical practice, a population health screening approach could underestimate the impact of 
preventive screening in larger populations with diverse cohorts. There is potential for overinterpretation of disease 
risk along with ethical and social factors. The risk of benefits of population-based screening programs need to be 
carefully assessed with long-term studies; at this time, application is not considered in accordance with generally 
accepted standards of medical practice. 
 
High-risk Population Screening 
The Galleri test (Grail, Inc., Menlo Park, CA) is a liquid biopsy test designed to detect over 50 types of cancer. The 
test is intended to be used with existing screening tools to improve cancer detection in individuals at increased risk 
of cancer. Because its intended use is as a screening test, the developers were primarily interested in creating a test 
with high specificity and thus a low false-positive rate.  
 
The Galleri test development was informed by findings from the Circulating Cell-Free Atlas (CCGA) study, a 
prospective observational study to develop and validate a multi-cancer detection test. The CCGA enrolled 15,254 
participants, 8584 with cancer and 6670 without cancer. In 2020, Liu and colleagues published results of a sub-
study of the CCGA evaluating the sensitivity and specificity of a multi-cancer ctDNA test (the current version of 
which is known as the Galleri test). The analysis included 6689 participants from the CCGA who did not have 
cancer (n=4207) or whose cancer was previously untreated (n=2482). The sample was divided into training and 
validation sets. The test had high specificity in both the training set (99.8%, 95% confidence interval [CI], 99.4 to 
99.9) and the validation set (99.3%, 95% CI, 98.3 to 99.8%), indicating a false positive rate of less than 1%. The 
sensitivity of the test for stage I-III cancers was 44.2% (95% CI, 31.4 to 47.2%) in the training set and 43.9% (95% 
CI, 39.4 to 48.5%) in the validation set. For the pre-specified group of 12 “high-signal cancers”, stage I-III 
sensitivity was 69.8% (95% CI, 65.6 to 73.7%) in the training set and 67.3% (95% CI, 60.7 to 73.3%) in the 
validation set. High-signal cancers, identified in preliminary research studies, include the following types of cancer: 
“anus, bladder, colon/rectum, esophagus, head and neck, liver/bile-duct, lung, lymphoma, ovary, pancreas, plasma 
cell neoplasm, stomach”.  
 
Another sub-analysis of the CCGA was published by Klein and colleagues in 2021 and evaluated the test with an 
independent validation set of 5309 CCGA participants (n=3237 with cancer and n=2069 without cancer). 
Specificity was 99.5% (95% CI, 99.0 to 99.8%), indicating a false positive rate of 0.5% and overall sensitivity was 
51.5% (95% CI, 49.6% to 53.3%). Sensitivity for the 12 high-signal cancers, discussed above, was 76.3% (95% CI, 
74.0 to 78.5%). 
 
The test has not been evaluated in a large, prospective setting to assess the population-based implications of 
screening, including the potential for overdiagnosis and overtreatment, as well the sequelae of false-positive results 
(including associated follow-up testing, both invasive and non-invasive), and false-negative results (which may 
include obviation of recommended screening test such as colonoscopy or mammography). 
 
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) 
It is estimated that most disease-causing mutations (around 85%) of clinically important sequence variants occur 
within the regions of the genome that encode proteins. While similar to whole genome sequencing (WGS), WES 
reads only the parts of the human genome that encode proteins, leaving the other regions of the genome unread 
(Choi, 2009). Since most of the errors that occur in DNA sequences that then lead to genetic disorders are located 
in the exons, sequencing of the exome is being explored as a more efficient method of analyzing an individual's

DNA to discover the genetic cause of diseases or disabilities. It has been theorized that sequencing of the human 
exome can be used to identify genetic variants in individuals to diagnose diseases.  
 
A potential major indication of WES is the establishment of a molecular diagnosis in individuals with a phenotype 
that is suspicious for a genetic disorder or for individuals with known genetic disorders that have a large degree of 
genetic heterogeneity involving substantial gene complexity. Such individuals may be left without a clinical 
diagnosis of their disorder, despite a lengthy diagnostic work-up involving a variety of traditional molecular and 
other types of conventional diagnostic tests. For some of these individuals, WES, after initial conventional testing 
has failed to make the diagnosis, may return a likely pathogenic variant. Results of WES testing are intended to 
guide treatment decisions including confirming or establishing a clinical diagnosis that may lead to changes in 
management (which may in some cases, may obviate the need for further testing, and/or end the diagnostic 
odyssey).  
 
The 2021 Practice Guideline by the ACMG provides exome sequencing and genome sequencing recommendations 
for children with congenital anomalies or intellectual disability (Manickam, 2021) based on an assessment of 167 
studies, 36 of which had a participant population greater than 20 individuals. The guidelines strongly recommend 
whole exome/genome sequencing as a first-tier or second-tier test (guided by clinical judgment and often clinician–
member/family shared decision making after CMA or focused testing) for individuals with one or more congenital 
anomalies prior to one year of age or for individuals with developmental delay (DD) or intellectual disability with 
onset prior to 18 years of age: 
The literature supports the clinical utility and desirable effects of whole exome/genome 
sequencing on active and long-term clinical management of patients with congenital anomalies, 
or developmental delay or intellectual disability, and on family-focused and reproductive 
outcomes with relatively few harms. Compared with standard genetic testing, whole 
exome/genome sequencing has a higher diagnostic yield. 
 
The guidelines also note that WES, which only evaluates the coding regions of the genome, is widely available, 
with extensive experience interpreting and comparing test results. At this time, WGS, which provides additional 
assessment of non-coding regions of the genome is limited to small number of clinics and labs. The ACMG 
includes WES in their guideline statement merely with the expectation that WES will become more commonly used 
and available. 
 
For prenatal testing, recommendations are made in a 2022 position statement from the International Society for 
Prenatal Diagnosis on the use of genome-wide sequencing. For prenatal diagnosis, the authors recommend prenatal 
sequencing can be beneficial in current pregnancies with a fetus with a major single anomaly or multiple organ 
system anomalies. Sequencing can also be beneficial with a maternal or paternal personal history of a prior 
undiagnosed fetus who was affected by a major single or multiple anomalies.  
 
Historically, prenatal diagnosis has been performed using G-banded karyotyping to detect chromosomal 
abnormalities. The yield in this approach results in a diagnosis in 9-19% of fetal anomalies. The use of CMA 
provides an additional 6% yield. Cause of the majority of fetal anomalies is unknown. Identifying the cause of fetal 
anomalies can help determine prognosis, inform recurrence risk, and guide clinical management. Prior studies of 
use of exome sequencing to diagnose unexplained fetal anomalies showed diagnostic yields of 8.5% and 10% 
(Petrovski, 2019; Lord, 2019). The relatively low yields might be explained by the wide range of structural 
anomalies which were included. There is limited data regarding the usefulness of exome sequencing for diagnosis 
of specific, severe prenatal phenotypes. In a 2020 study by Sparks and colleagues the authors reported on the

diagnostic yield of exome sequencing in detecting pathogenic or pathogenic variants in 127 participants with 
unexplained cases of nonimmune hydrops fetalis (NIHF). The presence of NIHF was defined by fetal ascites, 
pleural or pericardial effusions, skin edema, cystic hygroma, increased nuchal translucency, or combination of the 
conditions. There were 37/127 cases in which the authors identified diagnostic genetic variants. Overall there were 
25/37 cases in which diagnostic variants were autosomal dominant (12% of those were inherited and 88% were de 
novo). Autosomal recessive diagnostic variants were found in 10/37 cases (95% inherited and 5% de novo). 
Potentially diagnostic variants were identified in 12 additional cases.  
 
WES presents ethical questions about informing individuals about incidental findings that have clinical 
significance. Ongoing discussions continue to explore whether or not, and how to inform individuals about 
medically relevant mutations in genes unrelated to the diagnostic question (that is, mutations of unknown 
significance, non-paternity and sex chromosome abnormalities). This type of information may not only affect the 
individual being tested, but may also implicate family members.  
 
The 2021 Practice Guideline by the ACMG (Manickam, 2021) notes: 
ES is available widely as a clinical tool with a number of commercial and academic laboratories 
offering this testing. Best practice includes familial comparators (“trio”) if available to help 
contextualize rare variants, but also can be effectively performed as proband only or duo, with 
diagnostic yield being slightly reduced compared with trio testing. 
 
While some of the potential advantages of WES include the fact that it can be carried out more quickly than 
traditional genetic testing, it is not without limitations. WES typically covers only 85-95% of the exome and has no, 
or limited coverage of other areas of the genome. Areas of concern with this technology include: (1) gaps in the 
identification of exons prior to sequencing; (2) the need to narrow the large initial number of variants to 
manageable numbers without losing the likely candidate mutation; (3) difficulty identifying the potential causative 
variant when large numbers of variants of unknown significance are generated for each individual. It is more 
difficult to detect chromosomal changes, duplications, large deletions, rearrangements, epigenetic changes or 
nucleotide repeats from WES data compared with other genomic technologies (ACMG, 2012; Teer, 2010[a]; Teer, 
2010[b]). Other uses of WES are not considered in accordance with generally accepted standards of medical 
practice. 
 
Whole Genome Sequencing 
WGS, also known as full genome sequencing (FGS), complete genome sequencing, or entire genome sequencing, is 
a laboratory procedure which seeks to determine an individual's entire DNA sequence, specifying the order of every 
base pair within the genome at a single time. WGS allows researchers to study the 98% of the genome that does not 
generally contain protein-coding genes. In the clinical setting, this process frequently involves obtaining a DNA 
sample from the individual (typically from blood, saliva, or bone marrow) and sequencing an individual's entire 
chromosomal and mitochondrial DNA. Because of the large volume of genomic data involved in this process, the 
genomic information is processed by and stored on microprocessors and computers.  
 
A 2021 randomized trial by Krantz and colleagues reported on the effect of WGS in the clinical management of 354 
acutely ill infants. Participants included acutely ill infants in pediatric intensive care units, aged between 0 and 120 
days with a clinical suspicion of a genetic disorder. Participants were randomized to receive WGS test results either 
15 days (the early group, n=176) or 60 days (the delayed group, n=178) after testing with a total 90-day observation 
window. Primary outcome was the difference in the number of participants who had a change in management in the 
early and delayed groups at 60 days. Change in management was defined as having no change in care, a condition-

specific intervention, condition-specific supportive care, palliative care, or a combination of the latter. Secondary 
outcome measures included diagnostic efficacy of WGS, change of management at 90 days, length of hospital stay, 
and mortality. At 60 days, in the early group, diagnostic efficacy was found in 55/176 infants and a change in 
management was noted in 34/161 infants. At 60 days in the delayed group, diagnostic efficacy was found in 27/178 
infants with a change in management in 17/165 infants. At 90 days, in the early group, diagnostic efficacy was 
noted in 55/176 infants with a change in management in 38/159 infants. At 90 days, in the delayed group, 
diagnostic efficacy was noted in 56/178 infants with a change in management noted in 45/161 infants. The most 
frequent changes in management at 60 days were condition-supportive care and included subspecialty referrals and 
medication changes. There were no significant differences regarding mortality and length of hospital stay between 
the early and delayed groups. Given the 90-day observation window, it is likely other changes in management may 
not have been captured. There is also a lack of validated instruments in testing individual- and family-reported 
outcomes.  
 
Researchers continue to explore the relationship between mutations in the genomic material and the development or 
presence of disease. The clinical role of WGS has yet to be established. Research is still being done to determine if 
WGS can be used to accurately identify the presence of a disease, predict the development of a particular disease in 
asymptomatic individuals as well as how an individual might respond to pharmacological therapy. It has been 
theorized that WGS might eventually improve clinical outcomes by preventing the development of disease. 
 
Cytogenomic Microarray Analysis  
Cytogenomic microarray analysis collectively describes two different laboratory techniques: array comparative 
genomic hybridization (aCGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. While both of these techniques 
detect copy number variants (CNVs), they identify different types of genetic variation. aCGH allows the detection 
of gains and losses in DNA copy number across the entire genome without prior knowledge of specific 
chromosomal abnormalities. SNP arrays allow genotyping based on allele frequency. SNP arrays have additional 
oligonucleotide probes which analyze thousands of SNPs throughout the genome in order to identify deletions and 
duplications. The use of cytogenomic microarray analysis as a diagnostic tool for congenital anomalies as well as 
for individuals with unexplained developmental delay (DD), autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or intellectual 
disability (intellectual developmental delay) is specifically addressed by CG-GENE-10 Chromosomal Microarray 
Analysis (CMA) for Developmental Delay, Autism Spectrum Disorder, Intellectual Disability and Congenital 
Anomalies.  
 
Molecular Profiling 
Molecular profiling, also called comprehensive genomic profiling, is a method for identifying multiple biomarkers 
in the malignant tumors of persons who have cancer. The biomarker information can be used to identify treatment 
options. The personalized tumor molecular profiling services or test panels addressed in this document are similar 
in that they all produce a molecular profile of the tumor and a list of potential therapies. However, their individual 
testing methods vary from matching over expressed genes with drugs to more complex systems biology 
approaches. Large multi-biomarker panels test a variety of markers. It is often the case that not every test in these 
panels has a proven benefit. 
 
Some commercially available molecular profile panels are listed below: 
FoundationOne 
FoundationOne uses next generation sequencing (NGS) “to interrogate the entire coding sequence of 236 cancer-
related genes (3769 exons) plus 47 introns from 19 genes frequently altered or rearranged in cancer.” 
FoundationOne helps match the genomic alterations present in a tumor with specific targeted therapies or clinical

trials. Recent small studies (Drilon, 2013; Lipson, 2012; Vignot, 2013) have investigated next generation 
sequencing in individuals with lung cancer. Others have used next generation sequencing in those with breast 
cancer (Ross, 2013a); colorectal and other gastrointestinal cancers (Dhir, 2017; Gong, 2017; Lipson, 2012), ovarian 
cancer (Ross, 2013b), and prostate cancer (Beltran, 2013). Limitations of these studies include small sample sizes 
and lack of randomization.

specific companion diagnostic tests including the cobas

BRCA 
(BRCA1 and BRCA2). The 
sample size for each biomarker comparison study ranged from 175 to 342, the positive percent agreement ranged 
from 89.4% to 100%, and the negative percent agreement ranged from 86.1% to 100%. For the BRCA1 and 
BRCA2 mutation, the FoundationOne CDx was considered concordant based on the previous approval of the 
FoundationFocus CDx
BRCA
 test. The FDA states, “The clinical concordance studies, with the exception of ALK and 
EGFR T790M, were subject to pre-screening bias, therefore the concordance results may be overestimated and the 
failure rate may be underestimated.” For the T790M mutation, there is ongoing research to determine why a subset 
population with a mutant allele frequency < 5% tested negative with the cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 but tested 
positive with the FoundationOne CDx test. The FDA concluded that, overall, the FoundationOne CDx test 
demonstrated non-inferiority to the corresponding specific companion diagnostic tests (FDA, 2017a). On March 16, 
2018, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) approved NGS-based in vitro companion diagnostic 
laboratory tests for national coverage after an FDA-CMS parallel review.  
 
In 2018, Hellmann and colleagues reported results from the CheckMate 227 study, an open-label, phase 3 trial 
(NCT02477826) designed to evaluate the efficacy of nivolumab or nivolumab-based regimens as first-line therapy 
in participants with stage IV or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) that have not previously received 
chemotherapy as primary therapy. Trial participants were stratified into PD-L1 expression levels (at least 1% or less 
than 1%). In addition, tumor mutation burden was determined using the FoundationOne CDx assay. At 1 year, the 
progression-free survival (PFS) rate for participants with a high tumor mutation burden that received nivolumab in 
combination with ipilimumab was 42.6% versus 13.2% for the chemotherapy group. The median PFS was 7.2 
months (95% confidence interval [CI], 5.5 to 13.2) for participants that received nivolumab in combination with 
ipilimumab versus 5.5 months for the chemotherapy group (95% CI, 4.4 to 5.8) (HR for disease progression or 
death, 0.58; 97.5% CI, 0.41 to 0.81; P<0.001). The authors concluded: 
 
Progression-free survival was significantly longer with first-line nivolumab plus ipilimumab than 
with chemotherapy alone among patients with NSCLC and a high tumor mutational burden,

irrespective of PD-L1 expression level. The results validate the benefit of nivolumab plus 
ipilimumab in NSCLC and the role of tumor mutational burden as a biomarker for patient 
selection. 
 
Additional data regarding the CheckMate 227 study was published by Hellmann and colleagues in 2019. The 
authors reported on the overall survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab compared to chemotherapy in participants 
with a tumor PD-L1 expression level of 1% or greater. There were 679 participants who had evaluation of tumor 
mutation burden which showed a similar degree of overall survival regardless of whether they had a high tumor 
mutation burden or a low tumor mutation burden. The authors conclude: 
 
...although absolute survival with nivolumab plus ipilimumab was greatest in patients with a high tumor 
mutational burden, a similar relative benefit of nivolumab plus ipilimumab, as compared with 
chemotherapy, was seen in patients regardless of tumor mutational burden. 
 
Based on this data showing no difference in survival outcomes between individuals whose tumors had high or low 
levels of tumor mutation burden, Bristol-Myers Squibb announced its decision in January 2019 to withdraw the 
supplemental biologics license application with the FDA seeking approval for the combination of nivolumab and 
ipilimumab for individuals with advanced NSCLC with tumor mutational burden greater than or equal to 10 
mutations per megabase. 
 
The 2023 NCCN guideline for NSCLC notes that the emerging biomarker tumor mutation burden may be helpful to 
identify eligibility of first-line therapy with nivolumab with or without ipilimumab for those with NSCLC, however 
there is no consensus regarding how to measure tumor mutation burden.  
 
In June 2020, the FDA updated the label for pembrolizumab (Keytruda
®
 [Merck, Kenilworth, NJ]) to include 
treatment for individuals with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with tumor mutation burden-high (defined as 
greater than or equal to 10 mutations per megabase) when confirmed by an FDA-approved test following 
progression after prior treatment and no satisfactory alternative treatment options. According to the FDA label, the 
accelerated approval was based on the Keynote-158 trial (NCT02628067), a multicenter, non-randomized, open-
label trial. Efficacy outcomes were tumor response rate and duration of response. Tumor mutation burden was 
assessed by the Foundation One CDx assay. Of the 1050 subjects enrolled in the efficacy analysis population, 
tumor mutation burden was analyzed in 790 subjects. There were 102 subjects who had tumors identified as tumor 
mutation burden-high. With a median follow-up time of 11.1 months, 29% of participants reached an objective 
response rate, 4% reached a complete response, and 25% reached a partial response. Duration of response was 
assessed at 57% with a duration of greater than or equal to 12 months and 50% with a duration of greater than or 
equal to 24 months. Continuation of approval may be contingent on verification and description of clinical benefit 
in confirmatory trials.  
 
FoundationOne Liquid CDx 
In 2020, Woodhouse and colleagues published data on the performance of the FoundationOne Liquid CDX test. 
The authors retrospectively tested plasma samples from 375 individuals with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, 
HER2-negative breast cancer to evaluate the clinical validity of the assay as an aid in identifying individuals with 
PIK3CA alterations. In comparing the FoundationOne Liquid CDx test and the tumor tissue polymerase chain 
reaction (PCR)-based clinical trial assay (CTA), the positive percent agreement (PPA) was 71.7% and the negative 
percent agreement (NPA) was 100%. In addition, to evaluate the clinical validity of the assay as an aid in 
identifying individuals with advanced NSCLC who might be eligible for treatment with an EGFR tyrosine kinase

inhibitor, the authors used samples collected for another clinical trial that had been evaluated with a different test 
(the EGRF Mutation Test v2). They conducted a non-inferiority analysis with 177 samples to evaluate the non-
inferiority of the FoundationOne test to two replications of the reference test. The analysis found that the 
Foundation One Liquid CDx test was non-inferior to the reference test. In the first replication, the PPA between the 
FoundationOne Liquid CDx test and the reference test was 97.7% and the NPA was 95.6%. In the second 
replication, the PPA was 97.7% and the NPA was 95.4%.  
 
In 2021, Takeda and colleagues reported on a prospective cohort study to evaluate the feasibility and utility of using 
the FoundationOne CDx test with individuals who have advanced or recurrent solid tumors. A total of 181 samples 
were processed and 175 of these yielded gene profiling data, for a success rate of 96.7%. A total of 174 of the 175 
tested individuals had at least one known or likely pathogenic gene alteration, and 24 individuals (14%) received 
targeted therapy. Results of Kaplan-Meier analysis found that the median progression-free survival (PFS) was 12.1 
(95% CI, 6.9 to 17.4) months for the individuals who received targeted therapy. The authors did not report PFS in 
individuals who did not receive targeted therapy. 
 
Yang and colleagues (2022) conducted a multivariate analysis of factors associated with survival in 185 individuals 
with newly diagnosed glioblastoma who underwent FoundationOne CDx testing. In the full model that controlled 
for potential confounding variables, the presence of three of nine variants, CDKN2B, EGFR and PTEN were 
significantly associated with overall survival (OS) (CDKN3B and EGFR with reduced survival and PTEN with 
higher survival). None of the nine variants assessed were significantly associated with progression-free survival. 
 
LiquidHALLMARK 
Poh and colleagues (2022) reported on the diagnostic performance of the LiquidHallmark test, an 80-gene panel 
consisting of an amplicon-based NGS assay for genomic profiling of cfDNA. The authors examined 1592 samples 
submitted to their laboratory between January 2018 and May 2021. A total of 52% of samples were from 
individuals with lung cancer. The test is designed for individuals with advanced cancer; however, 9% of samples 
were from individuals with localized tumors and 4.5% were from healthy individuals undergoing screening. A total 
of 73.6% (1120/1521) cancer samples were ctDNA positive, including in 40.6% of localized tumor samples and 
78.5% of metastatic tumor samples. The most commonly altered genes among the ctDNA positive samples were 
TP53, KRAS, PIK3CA, APC, SMAD4, and PTEN. EGFR alterations were detected in 36.1% of the ctDNA 
positive samples and in 62.8% of the lung cancer samples.  
 
Ravi and colleagues (2022) evaluated the ability of the LiquidHallmark test to identify resistance mechanisms to 
immune checkpoint inhibitors. The study included 39 individuals with advanced urothelial carcinoma and involved 
serial testing with the LiquidHallmark test. At least one genomic alteration was detected in the ctDNA samples of 
37 individuals (95%) pre-therapy and 39 individuals (100%) post-therapy. There was a median of three unique 
genomic alterations per individual in both the pre- and post-immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy samples. The 
most common genomic alterations were in TP53 (54% pre- and post-therapy), TERT (49% pre-therapy and 59% 
post-therapy, respectively) and BRCA1/BRCA2 (33% pre-therapy and 33% post-therapy, respectively). At the time 
the samples were taken post-therapy, 9 of 36 evaluable individuals (25%) had a complete or partial response to 
treatment. Among these 9 individuals, 7 (78%) had clearance of one or more of their genomic alterations according 
to ctDNA. Four individuals had clearance of TP53 variants and these individuals had a significantly higher rate of 
response to immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy compared to individuals who had TP53 variants after therapy 
(50% versus 12.5%; p=0.046).

Other Tests 
Other tests are becoming available on the market. One such example is the Oncotype MAP
™ 
PanCancer Tissue Test 
(Paradigm Diagnostics, Inc., Phoenix, AZ) in which next-generation sequencing is used to identify genetic 
alterations among 257 genes to match appropriate targeted therapy for tumor mutation burden of solid tumors. 
 
Whole transcriptome testing can assist in determining how cells normally function and how changes in gene 
activity can contribute to disease by showing what genes are active in which cells. DNA is the molecule which 
contains instructions needed to build and maintain cells. In order for the instructions to be read and completed, the 
DNA has to be read and transcribed (that is, copied into RNA). The testing involves the presence and amount of 
RNA. By analyzing the RNA, it is possible to count the transcripts to determine the amount of gene activity.  
 
Molecular Intelligence Service or Target Now 
A widely used tumor molecular profile has been the Target Now Molecular Profiling Service. According to the 
Caris Life Sciences website, their tumor profiling service is now being promoted as the Molecular Intelligence
™ 
Service. The published literature addressing these services is limited. Von Hoff and colleagues (2010) evaluated 86 
individuals with refractory metastatic cancer. PFS using a treatment regimen selected by Target Now molecular 
profiling of a malignant tumor was compared with the PFS of the most recent treatment regimen on which the 
individual experienced progression. A molecular target was detected in 84 of 86 (98%) participants. A total of 66 
(78.6%) individuals were treated according to the molecular profile results with 18 of the 66 (27%) having a PFS 
ratio (defined as PFS on molecular profile–selected therapy or PFS on prior therapy) of greater than or equal to 1.3 
(95% CI, 17% to 38%; p=0.007). 
 
An editorial (Doroshow, 2010) accompanying the study reported that the trial had a number of significant 
limitations, including uncertainty surrounding the achievement of time to progression (the study’s primary 
endpoint), and a lack of a randomized design. Additional limitations include a small number of participants and 
lack of duplication of study results by an independent dataset. 
 
Memorial Sloan Kettering-Integrated Mutation Profiling of Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) 
Cheng and colleagues (2015) developed and evaluated the MSK-IMPACT, “a hybridization capture-based assay 
targeting all coding regions of 341 oncogenes and tumor suppressors.” The ability of the assay to detect single 
nucleotide variants (SNVs) and short insertions and deletions (indels) was assessed in 284 known positive solid 
tumor samples. Of these, 75 had a matched normal sample available. The authors reported successful detection of 
known variants in all 284 cases, and ability to achieve high degrees of resolution and levels of coverage to > 500x 
in tumor samples that allows low-frequency mutations to be detected. On November 15, 2017, the FDA granted 
marketing authorization for MSK-IMPACT based on a de novo request (FDA 2017b). 
 
Other Molecular Profiling 
Other molecular profiling such as, GeneKey, GeneTrails Solid Tumor Panel, MatePair, MyAML, OmniSeq, 
OnkoMatch, OncInsights, and SmartGenomics have less published validation. To date, there is insufficient peer-
reviewed evidence specifically validating these tests. 
 
In 2012, Tsimberidou and colleagues developed a personalized medicine program at a single facility in the context 
of early clinical trials. Their goal was to observe whether molecular analysis of advanced cancer and use of targeted

therapy to counteract the effects of specific aberrations would be associated with improved clinical outcomes. 
Participants with advanced or metastatic cancer refractory to standard therapy underwent molecular profiling. A 
total of 175 subjects were treated with matched therapy, and the overall response rate was 27%. Of the 116 subjects 
treated with non-matched therapy, the response rate was 5%. The median time-to-failure was 5.2 months for those 
on matched therapy versus 2.2 months on non-matched therapy. At a median of 15 months follow-up, median 
survival was 13.4 months versus 9.0 months in favor of matched therapy. 
 
Jameson and colleagues (2013) performed a small pilot study investigating multi-omic molecular profiling (MMP) 
for the selection of breast cancer treatment. MMP treatment recommendations were selected in 25 cases and 
original treatment plans were revised accordingly. Partial responses were reported in 5/25 (20%), stable disease in 
8/25 (32%) and 9/25 had no disease progression at 4 months. This study was limited by its small size and non-
randomization. A large randomized prospective trial is needed for further evaluation.

Studies on Molecular Profiling Therapy 
LeTourneau and colleagues (2012, 2015) reported on an open-label, randomized controlled phase II trial of 
treatment of refractory metastatic solid tumors directed by molecular profiling versus standard of care treatment 
(SHIVA trial). A total of 195 adults, consisting of 99 in the experimental group and 96 in the control group, were 
enrolled from eight academic centers in France. The primary outcome was progression-free survival (PFS) analyzed 
by intention-to-treat. Randomization was stratified by three molecular pathways (hormone receptor pathway, 
PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway, and RAF/MEK pathway). Molecular analysis included targeted NGS, gene copy 
number alterations and hormone expression by immunohistochemistry. The molecularly targeted drugs used in the 
experimental group were approved for clinical use in France, but were outside their indications. The control group 
received standard treatment chosen by the physician. Median follow-up was 11.3 months for both the experimental 
and control groups at the time of primary analysis of PFS. Median PFS was 2.3 months (95% CI, 1.7-3.8) in the 
experimental group versus 2.0 months (95% CI, 1.7-2.7 months) in the control group (hazard ratio, 0.88; 95% CI, 
0.65-1.19; p=0.41). Upon subgroup analysis, there was no statistically significant difference in PFS between the 
two groups. Objective responses were reported for 4 of 98 (4.1%) assessable subjects in the targeted treatment 
group versus 3 of 89 (3.4%) assessable subjects in the standard care group. Among the safety population, grade 3-4 
adverse events were reported for 43 of the 100 subjects (43%) who received a molecularly targeted agent and 32 
(35%) of 91 subjects treated in the control group. The authors suggested that “off-label use of molecularly targeted 
agents should be discouraged and enrollment in clinical trials should be encouraged to help identify predictive 
biomarkers of efficacy.” 
 
Presley and colleagues (2018) conducted a multicenter, retrospective, cohort study to compare broad-based 
genomic sequencing to routine EGFR and ALK biomarker testing in individuals with advanced NSCLC (stage 
IIIB/IV or unresectable nonsquamous). The primary outcomes were the 12-month mortality and overall survival 
from the start of first-line treatment. The researchers examined the Flatiron Health Database records of 5688 
individuals (median age 67 years) who received care for advanced NSCLC between January 1, 2011 and July 31, 
2016: 875 received broad-based genomic sequencing (multigene panel testing assay of more than 30 genes) and 
4813 received routine EGFR/ALK testing. Subjects were required to have documented broad-based genomic

sequencing testing or EGFR testing; if EGFR was negative, ALK testing was required. All subjects received at least 
one line of systemic antineoplastic treatment. At 12 months, the unadjusted mortality rates were 49.2% for the 
broad-based group and 35.9% for the EGFR/ALK group. Of the subjects in the broad-based group, 4.5% received 
targeted treatment based on test results, 9.8% received EGFR/ALK targeted treatment, and 85.1% received no 
targeted treatment. When using an instrumental variable analysis, no significant association was found between 
broad-based genomic sequencing and 12-month mortality (difference in the predicted probability of death at 12 
months between the groups: −3.6%; 95% CI, −18.4% to 11.1%; p=0.63). The predicted probability of 12-month 
mortality was 44.4% (95% CI, 42.9% to 45.9%) in the EGFR/ALK group and 41.1% (95% CI, 27.7% to 54.5%) in 
the broad-based group. For the propensity score-matched sample, the overall survival was not significantly different 
between the groups (42.0% vs. 45.1%; 0.92 HR; 95% CI, 0.73 to 1.11; p=0.40). The researchers concluded that 
“among patients receiving care for advanced NSCLC in the community oncology setting, broad-based genomic 
sequencing directly informed treatment in a minority of patients and was not independently associated with better 
survival.” Limitations of the study included a relatively small and homogenous sample for the broad-based group 
and the possible inaccuracy of the electronic health records.  
 
In an industry-sponsored study by Conroy and colleagues (2021) the authors present the initial results of their 
Illumina TruSight Oncology 500 High-Throughput assay as a scalable comprehensive genomic profiling way to 
detect and deliver biomarker information regarding precision therapeutics in oncology. The TruSight Oncology 
assay is a next-generation sequence-based in vitro diagnostic assay to detect genomic variants and signatures. The 
assay analyzes 523 cancer-relevant genes from RNA and DNA from routine formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded 
tissue specimens. In this study, there were 717 samples selected from an inventory of banked RNA and DNA. 
These samples represented 31 tumor types. While the assay detected small variants, copy number alterations, MSI, 
TMB, and gene fusions, this retrospective study shows no association with improved clinical outcomes. 
 
Other Considerations 
The 2023 NCCN Guidelines do not contain recommendations for the general strategy of testing a tumor for a wide 
range of biomarkers. However, the guidelines do contain recommendations for specific genetic testing for 
individual cancers, when there is a known drug-biomarker combination that has demonstrated benefits for that 
particular type of tumor, such as colon or NSCLC. In order to conserve tissue, the current NSCLC guidelines 
support an FDA approved NGS companion diagnostic test that can simultaneously test for EGFR mutations, BRAF 
mutations, ROS1 rearrangements, and ALK rearrangements. 
 
A 2018 joint guideline (Lindeman, 2018), Updated Molecular Testing Guideline for the Selection of Lung Cancer 
Patients for Treatment with Targeted Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors, from the CAP, International Association for the 
Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) states that “multiplexed 
genetic sequencing panels are preferred over multiple single-gene tests to identify other treatment options beyond 
EGFR, ALK, and ROS1” (level of evidence rating: expert consensus opinion - serious limitations in quality of 
evidence). However, the authors note that “the strength of evidence is inadequate supporting the use of multiplexed 
genetic sequencing panels compared with single-gene tests.” 
 
Polygenic Risk Score 
Polygenic risk score testing measures multiple single nucleotide polymorphisms which have been proposed as 
being associated with a specific disease or condition. Using an algorithm, a number or score is created that is 
intended to provide an estimated prediction of the risk of some future health outcome. Polygenic risk scores have 
been proposed to estimate an individual's lifetime genetic risk of disease. Polygenic risk score tests are being 
developed for a number of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, cancer, obesity, and schizophrenia.

In a 2020 study by Damask and colleagues, the authors sought to determine whether individuals with a high 
polygenic risk score for coronary artery disease had a higher incidence of major adverse cardiovascular events 
(MACE) and whether those individuals had greater risk reduction of events following treatment with alirocumab 
(given for hyperlipidemia). In this post-hoc analysis of participants from the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial 
(Evaluation of Cardiovascular Outcomes After an Acute Coronary Syndrome During Treatment With Alirocumab), 
there were 11,953 individuals who had available DNA samples. In this study the authors defined high genetic risk 
as those with greater than 90
th
 percentile polygenic risk score. Those with less than or equal to 90
th
 percentile were 
considered lower genetic risk. MACE risk analysis was performed in the placebo arm while treatment benefit 
analysis was performed in all participants. In the placebo group, the incidence of MACE related to polygenic risk 
score for coronary artery disease was 17.0% for those with high genetic risk and 11.4% for those considered to be 
low genetic risk. In the group who received treatment (alirocumab), the absolute reduction in those with high 
polygenic risk score was 6.0% and 1.5% in the low polygenic risk score group. The relative risk reduction by 
alirocumab was 37% in the high polygenic risk score group and 13% in the low polygenic risk score group. With 
this ad-hoc analysis, further validation is necessary. The authors also used a top threshold (defined in this study as 
greater than 90
th
 percentile). Lack of consistent threshold for polygenic risk scores across studies make it difficult to 
generalize these results. Furthermore, given that participants enrolled into the ODYSSEY OUTCOMES trial were 
already candidates for intensive lipid lowering therapy, the added clinical utility of polygenic risk scoring is 
uncertain. 
 
Marston and colleagues (2020) also reported on an ad-hoc analysis of 14,298 participants (7163 in the evolocumab 
arm and 7135 in the placebo arm) from the FOURIER trial (Further Cardiovascular Outcomes Research With 
PCSK9 Inhibition in Subjects With Elevated Risk). The FOURIER trial was a multinational, randomized, double-
blind, placebo-controlled trial which looked at the efficacy of evolocumab in individuals with atherosclerotic 
cardiovascular disease. In the Marston study, the authors sought to determine whether genetic risk score could risk-
stratify individuals with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease and predict benefit from evolocumab treatment. The 
authors looked at two outcomes; major coronary events (defined as coronary heart death, myocardial infarction, and 
coronary revascularization) and major vascular events (defined as major coronary events plus stroke). Those in the 
genetic cohort were followed for a median of 2.3 years. Genetic risk categories were measured as low, intermediate, 
or high. There were 1235 participants who had a major vascular event with 1074 of those being major coronary 
events. In the placebo arm, there were 774 participants who had a major vascular event, with 673 of those being 
major coronary events. Major vascular event rates in the low-genetic-risk category were 10.1%, 11.3% in the 
intermediate-genetic-risk category, and 13.8% in the high-genetic-risk category. Major coronary event rates in the 
low-genetic-risk category were 8.0%, 9.7% in the intermediate-genetic-risk category, and 13.2% in the high-
genetic-risk category. In the entire study cohort, there were 1446 participants with a major vascular event, 1269 of 
which were major coronary events. In assessing the benefit of evolocumab by genetic risk categories, the hazard 
ratios (95% CI) for major vascular events in the low-, intermediate-, and high-genetic-risk categories were 0.92, 
0.91, and 0.69, respectively. For those individuals without multiple clinical risk factors or high genetic risk, there 
was no benefit noted over a median of 2.3 years. In individuals with multiple clinical risk factors but without high 
genetic risk, there was a 13% relative risk reduction and 1.4% absolute risk reduction in major vascular events. For 
those with high genetic risk (irrespective of major clinical risk factors) there was a 31% relative risk reduction and 
4.0% absolute risk reduction. There was no significant difference for the ARR across clinical risk factor burden in 
the high-genetic-risk category for either major vascular events or major coronary events. Study participants were 
divided into categories based on percentile relative to the study population, not a healthy reference population, 
which may have led to individuals with higher genetic risk moved into lower risk categories. Given that participants

There is disagreement in the literature about whether adding polygenic risk score testing for coronary heart disease 
risk prediction adds value and improves net health outcomes. A 2022 review by Groenendyk and colleagues looked 
at five studies for coronary heart disease risk prediction and reported on the additive value of any new test for risk 
prediction. While polygenic risk score was associated with a risk of coronary heart disease in all studies, the 
addition did not lead to improvements in clinical decision-making or improved net health outcomes. Positive 
predictive values ranged from 1.8% to 16.6% and false-positives ranged from 77.1% to 85.7%. The authors 
concluded there were no meaningful improvements when polygenic risk scores were added to traditional risk scores 
for coronary heart disease. 
 
A 2022 cohort study by Joo and colleagues looked at whether genome-wide polygenic scores for psychiatric 
disorders and common traits were associated with the risk of suicidal thoughts among preadolescent children (age 
9-10 years old). The authors analyzed data from the cohort of the Adolescent Brain and Cognitive Development 
(ABCD) study. In order to generate genome-wide polygenic scores, the authors used 24 psychiatric and common 
traits known to be associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors. There were 6592 children included in the 
primary analysis (5374 of whom had only European ancestry). There were 935 children with suicidal thoughts or 
behaviors and 5657 children without suicidal thoughts or behaviors (the control group). Overall, the authors found 
genome-wide polygenic scores for attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) had the most significant 
association with phenotypes for suicidal thoughts and behaviors, with associations also found for schizophrenia and 
general happiness. For those in the European ancestry only group, three additional genome-wide polygenic scores 
were found to be associated with suicidal thoughts and behaviors: autism spectrum disorder, major depressive 
disorder, and posttraumatic stress disorder. While this cohort study results highlight the potential utility of genome-
wide polygenic scores, further development of screening methods and intervention strategies for children at risk of 
suicide are necessary. 
 
In a 2022 study by Bigdeli and colleagues, the authors reported on the penetrance of polygenic risk scores for 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and major depression of participants in the Veterans Health Administration. The 
billing codes were compared to in-person clinical interviews and in this retrospective review there were 707,299 
study participants with 9378 confirmed with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or bipolar 1 disorder. Among those with 
confirmed diagnosis, 8962 were also correctly identified using billing codes. Of the 707,299 total study 
participants, 84,806 were genotyped as African ancestry and 314,909 were of European ancestry. Polygenic risk 
scores were associated with a diagnosis of schizophrenia (odds ratio [OR], 1.81 [95%CI, 1.76-1.87]) and bipolar 
disorder (OR, 1.42 [95%CI, 1.39-1.44]. For those of African ancestry, the corresponding effect sizes in participants 
were smaller for schizophrenia (OR, 1.35 [95%CI, 1.29-1.42]) and bipolar disorder (OR, 1.16 [95%CI, 1.11-1.12]). 
There is no evidence of improved net health outcomes or change in medical management.  
 
While polygenic risk scores can explain relative risk for a disease, prospective data is needed to assess whether risk 
identification resulting in therapeutic decision-making leads to net health outcomes. Current studies also lack 
generalizability.  
 
Gene Panel Testing for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) 
The leading cause of blindness in the elderly population is AMD, a complex disease. There are two major types of 
AMD, a dry form and wet form. The dry form is associated with slowly progressive vision loss, and the wet form

may lead to rapidly progressive and severe vision loss. The risk of AMD and the risk for development of the wet 
form are associated with genetic factors and also non-genetic influences, such as smoking and obesity.  
 
Gene panel testing for AMD is aimed at identifying individuals at risk of developing advanced AMD. Genetic 
variants associated with AMD account for approximately 70% of the risk for the condition (Gorin, 2012). Over 25 
genes have been reported to influence the risk of developing AMD, discovered originally through family-based 
linkage studies, and then through large genome-wide association studies. Genes influencing several biological 
pathways, including genetic loci associated with the regulation of complement, lipid, angiogenic and extracellular 
matrix pathways, have been associated with the onset, progression and involvement of early, intermediate and 
advanced stages of AMD. 
 
Loci based on common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) contribute to the greatest AMD risk. Major AMD 
loci identified in different populations include complement factor H (CFH) and age-related maculopathy 
susceptibility 2 (ARMS2)/HtrA serine peptidase 1 (HTRA1). Although changes in both ARMS2 and HTRA1 have 
been studied as potential AMD risk factors, the two genes are located very close together, making it difficult to 
determine which one is associated with AMD risk, or whether both genes cause increased risk. Other genes in the 
complement pathway shown to be associated with AMD include complement 2 (C2), complement 3 (C3), 
complement factor B (CFB), and complement factor 1 (CF1). 
 
Large genome-wide association studies have implicated high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol pathway genes, 
including cholesterylester transfer protein (CETP) and hepatic lipase (LIPC), and possibly lipoprotein lipase (LPL) 
and ATP-binding cassette (ABCA1) (Lim, 2012). The collagen matrix pathway genes COL10A1 and COL8A1, the 
extracellular matrix pathway gene known as tissue inhibitor of metalloproteinase 3 (TIMP3) and genes in the 
angiogenesis pathway, vascular endothelial growth factor A (VEGFA) have been associated with AMD.  
 
Models for predicting AMD risk include various combinations of epidemiologic, clinical and genetic factors, and 
report areas under the curve (AUC) of approximately 0.8 (Hageman, 2011; Jakobsdottir, 2009). A multi-center 
prospective evaluation of 1446 participants by Seddon and colleagues (2009) demonstrated that a model of AMD 
risk that included age, gender, education, baseline AMD grade, smoking and body mass index gave an AUC of 
0.757. The addition of the genetic factors, SNPs in CFH, ARMS2, C2, C3 and CFB, increased the AUC to 0.821. 
Klein and colleagues (2011) evaluated longitudinal data from 2846 study participants and showed that an 
individual’s macular phenotype, as represented by the Age-Related Eye Disease Study (AREDS) Simple Scale 
score, which rates the severity of AMD based on the presence of large drusen and pigment changes to predict the 
rate of advanced AMD, has the greatest predictive value. The predictive model used in the Klein analysis included 
age, family history, smoking, the AREDS Simple Scale score, presence of very large drusen, presence of advanced 
AMD in one eye, and genetic factors (CFH and ARMS2). The AUC was 0.865 without genetic factors included and 
0.872 with genetic factors included. These risk models suggest a small increase in the ability to assess risk of 
developing advanced AMD based on genetic factors. In a 2015 analysis, Seddon and colleagues included 10 rare 
and common genetic variants in their risk prediction model, resulting in an AUC of 0.911 for progression to 
advanced AMD.  
 
The potential clinical utility of gene panel testing for AMD consists of prevention and monitoring of disease, and 
therapy guidance. Currently, the only preventive measures available for the disease are good health practices (for 
example, smoking cessation) and high-dose antioxidants and zinc supplements. The impact of more frequent 
monitoring for those at risk for developing AMD is unknown. In regard to therapy guidance, there have been no 
consistent associations between response to therapy and specific genotypes. Additionally, there is a lack of a

consistent association between response to vitamin supplements or anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) 
therapy and VEGF gene polymorphisms (Awh, 2013; Chew, 2014; Fauser, 2015; Hagstrom, 2014, Hagstrom, 
2015).  
 
In 2015, Awh and colleagues performed a retrospective subgroup analysis of subjects from the 2001 Age-Related 
Eye Disease Study (AREDS). DNA was not collected from all AREDS subjects and the analysis was based on 
DNA from white AREDS subjects with category 3 or 4 AMD. The analysis was restricted to white subjects 
“because AMD genetics has been studied best in this group.” Four genotype groups based on CFH and ARM2 risks 
alleles were defined. The benefit of treatment with the AREDS formulation seemed to be the result of a positive 
response by subjects in only one genotype group, and neutral or unfavorable responses in three genotype groups. 
Subjects with two CFH alleles and no ARMS2 risk alleles showed more of a progression with treatment containing 
zinc as compared to placebo. Subjects with zero or one CFH risk alleles and one or two ARMS2 risk alleles 
benefited with treatment containing zinc as compared to placebo. For subjects with zero or one CFH risk alleles and 
no ARMS2 risk alleles, zinc containing treatment did not alter progression as compared with placebo, but 
antioxidant treatment decreased progression. For subjects with two CFH risk alleles and one or two AMRS2 risks 
alleles, no treatment was better than placebo. The authors concluded that “validation by an independent data set 
would be helpful, but no such data exists, and a replication trial would take many years.” In reference to this 
analysis, Odaibo (2015) indicated that very different conclusions were drawn by Awh as compared to AREDS and 
pending a larger study specifically testing their hypothesis, no final conclusions can yet be drawn. 
 
Seddon and colleagues (2016) also retrospectively analyzed data from AREDS and similarly reported that the 
effectiveness of antioxidant and zinc supplementation appeared to vary by genotype and that genetic factors may 
become relevant when selecting specific treatments. However, the authors concluded that “additional studies are 
needed to determine the biological mechanism for this interaction and its implications for the comprehensive 
management of AMD.” 
 
The American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) Task Force on Genetic Testing (2022) includes the following 
recommendation for testing of inherited eye diseases: 
 
Avoid routine genetic testing for genetically complex disorders like age-related macular 
degeneration and late-onset primary open-angle glaucoma until specific treatment or surveillance 
strategies have been shown in 1 or more published clinical trials to be of benefit to individuals with 
specific disease associated genotypes. In the meantime, confine the genotyping of such patients to 
research studies. 
 
Stone (2015) re-emphasized the AAO recommendations and indicated that the clinical utility of genetic testing for 
AMD needs to be evaluated in a prospective randomized manner. 
 
The 2015 AAO Preferred Practice Pattern for AMD does not recommend the routine use of genetic testing for 
AMD and specifically states “One or more prospectively designed clinical trials will need to demonstrate the value 
of genetic testing in AMD. Thus, the routine use of genetic testing is not supported by the existing literature and is 
not recommended at this time.” 
 
Similarly, the 2020 AAO Age-Related Macular Degeneration Preferred Practice Pattern® document states:

The primary risk factors for the development of advanced AMD include increasing age, northern 
European ancestry, and genetic factors. Cigarette smoking is the main modifiable risk factor that 
has been consistently identified in numerous studies. Smoking cessation is strongly recommended 
when advising patients who have AMD or are at risk for AMD. The routine use of genetic testing 
is not recommended at this time (Flaxel, 2020). 
 
The clinical validity of gene panel testing for AMD may provide a small, incremental benefit to risk stratification 
based on non-genetic risk factors. However, the clinical utility of genetic testing for AMD is currently limited and 
any association with specific genotypes and specific therapies needs to be evaluated with additional study in a 
prospective manner. 
 
Commercially available gene panel tests for AMD include but are not necessarily limited to: 
• Macula Risk® PGx (Artic Medical Laboratory, Grand Rapids, MI) 
• RetnaGene™ AMD (Nicox for Sequenom, San Diego, CA) 
 
Chromosome Conformation Signature 
This refers to a type of genomic testing that looks at the regulation of an individual’s genes at the level of 3D 
conformation. It may provide information about how a person will or will not respond to therapy. Chromosome 
conformation signatures analyze changes in the regulation of a genome before the results of epigenetic changes are 
known to be obvious abnormalities. Using whole blood, the test genetically profiles 8 epigenetic markers by qPCR 
which are then reported as either high or low probability of responding to immune checkpoint-inhibitor therapy. 
There is a paucity of peer-reviewed published literature evaluating clinical outcomes for chromosome conformation 
signatures in evaluating checkpoint-inhibitor therapy. 
 
Background/Overview 
 
Genetic Testing Using Panels of Genes 
NGS addresses any of the technologies that allow rapid sequencing of large numbers of segments of DNA, up to 
and including entire genomes. NGS is not a specific sequencing technology or a test in itself. Instead, the term 
emphasizes the difference between the earlier testing methods that involved the sequencing of one DNA strand at a 
time. NGS includes but is not limited to massively parallel sequencing and microarray analysis.  
 
NGS has led to the development of genetic testing incorporating panels which analyze multiple genes for multiple 
mutations simultaneously. Genetic testing using panels of genes may identify numerous genetic mutations that may 
contribute to the development of hereditary cancers.  
 
Commercially available genetic testing panels for breast and/or ovarian cancers include, but are not limited to: 
BreastNext
®
 (Ambry Genetics
®
); OvaNext
®
 (Ambry Genetics
®
); BREVAGen (Phenogen Sciences); and myRisk 
Hereditary Cancer test (Myriad Genetics). 
 
• The BreastNext genetic panel evaluates select genes that may be associated with a lifetime risk of 
breast cancer for individuals who, based on personal and family history, are at high risk for breast 
cancer and have tested negative for BRCA1 and 2 mutations. 
• The OvaNext genetic panel simultaneously analyzes 23 genes that contribute to an increased risk 
for breast, ovarian and/or uterine cancers.

• The BREVAGen genetic panel assesses the risk for sporadic breast cancer by combining a 
woman’s individual clinical risk factors (Gail score) with seven specific genetic markers. 
• The myRisk Hereditary Cancer panel uses next-generation sequencing to examine genes 
associated with 8 cancer syndromes (breast, colorectal, endometrial, melanoma, pancreatic, 
gastric, and prostate). 
 
The ColoNext
™
 test (manufactured by Ambry Genetics) is an example that tests for variants in 14 genes 
that have been associated with hereditary colorectal cancer, including the genes that cause Lynch 
syndrome (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 and EPCAM) as well as the gene that causes FAP (APC). 
 
Circulating Tumor DNA Testing (Liquid Biopsy) 
Liquid biopsy is proposed as a less-invasive method for cancer identification, surveillance, and treatment guidance. 
The National Cancer Institute (NCI) defines liquid biopsy as “a test done on a sample of blood to look for cancer 
cells from a tumor that are circulating in the blood or for pieces of DNA from tumor cells that are in the blood.” 
ctDNA tests detect small fragments of mutated DNA that are released from tumors into blood, presumably by 
apoptosis and/or necrosis. Some ctDNA liquid biopsy tests are targeted for specific gene mutations. For example, in 
the instance of non-small cell lung cancer, a targeted liquid biopsy may be used to identify the presence of the 
EGFR mutation and determine if individuals may benefit from kinase inhibitor medication. Other liquid biopsy 
tests analyze multiple biomarkers and are purported to detect various cancers or treatments (Perakis, 2017). 
 
There are several limitations of liquid biopsies. In regard to cancer management, many cancers do not have specific 
DNA mutations that can be identified and, when present, can be different in individuals with the same cancer. The 
DNA found in the fluid sample may not fully represent the tumor and mislead treatment decisions. The mutations 
found may not be “driver” mutations and may not provide useful information about the cancer. In regard to cancer 
detection, liquid biopsies can test positive for cancer when no cancer is present (false-positive) or test negative 
when cancer is present (false-negative). Because cancer cells release more mutated DNA fragments in later cancer 
stages, the test may not identify early cancer. Likewise, a liquid biopsy can detect cancerous cells that may never 
actually cause harm, leading to overtreatment (NCI, 2018). While liquid biopsies are promising, a great deal of 
research is still needed to determine if these tests improve outcomes for individuals with cancer. 
 
Whole Genome Sequencing  
WGS, also known as full genome sequencing (FGS), complete genome sequencing, or entire genome sequencing, is 
a laboratory procedure which seeks to determine an individual's entire DNA sequence, specifying the order of every 
base pair within the genome at a single time. The role of WGS in the clinical setting has yet to be established.  
 
Whole Exome Sequencing 
While similar to WGS, WES reads only the parts of the human genome that encode proteins. Since most of the 
errors that occur in DNA sequences that then lead to genetic disorders are located in the exons, sequencing of the 
exome is being explored as a more efficient method of analyzing an individual's DNA to discover the genetic cause 
of diseases or disabilities. Various applications of WES are being explored including but not limited to determining 
if sequencing of the human exome can be used to identify genetic variants in individuals in order to diagnose 
diseases in individuals without the processing complexity associated with WGS.  
 
Molecular Profiling 
The rationale for molecular profiling is that more complete knowledge of molecular marker status may alter 
treatment and possibly improve individual outcomes. Molecular profiling refers to the analysis of DNA, RNA

and/or proteins within the tumor cells. The term “molecular profiling” was initially limited to DNA analysis, but 
has now expanded to include analyses of RNA and proteins as well. Examples of commercially available multiple 
molecular testing panels are listed above. At this, only use of molecular profiling as a means of assessing tumor 
mutation burden has been established as a means of identifying candidates for targeted drug therapy. 
 
Polygenic Risk Score 
A polygenic risk score is a way for individuals to learn about their risk of developing a disease based on the total 
number of changes related to the disease. Some diseases can be traced to a variant in a single gene, while other 
diseases can occur due to variants in multiple genes. These variants can be identified by comparing the genomes of 
individuals with and without the disease. Using a computerized algorithm and statistics, a number or score is 
created to estimated how the collection of an individual’s variants affect risk for a certain disease.  
 
Gene Panel Testing for Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD) 
AMD, a global disease that causes blindness, is becoming increasingly prevalent and has no effective cure (Jager, 
2008). AMD affects the macula located in the center of the retina. The macula has the highest photoreceptor 
concentration and is where visual detail is discerned. Wet AMD occurs with the pathological formation of new 
blood vessels (angiogenesis) behind the retina. These new blood vessels often leak blood and fluid displacing the 
macula from its normal position at the back of the eye and distorting central vision as a result. Wet AMD is also 
known as advanced AMD.  
 
According to the American Academy of Ophthalmology, the risk of AMD increases as an individual ages. AMD is 
most common among older white Americans, affecting more than 14% of white Americans 80 years of age and 
older. Caucasian Americans have the greatest likelihood of developing AMD (in 2010 affecting 2.5% of white 
adults age 50). By comparison, AMD affected 0.9%  each of African-Americans, Hispanics and people of other 
races (AAO, 2019).  
 
Commercially available gene panel tests for AMD are aimed at identifying those individuals who are at risk of 
developing advanced AMD. Examples of these tests include but are not necessarily limited to the following: 
 
Arctic Medical Laboratories offers Macula Risk PGx which uses 15 associated biomarkers in an 
algorithm to determine an individual’s risk of progression to advanced AMD and aid in the 
selection of eye vitamin formulations for AMD based on his or her individual genetic risk profile. 
The Vita Risk™ pharmacogenetic result is provided as part of the Macula Risk PGx laboratory 
report.  
 
Nicox offers Sequenom’s RetnaGene AMD in North America, which evaluates the risk of an 
individual with early or intermediate AMD progressing to advanced choroidal neovascular disease 
(wet AMD). The RetnaGene AMD test assesses the impact of 12 genetic variants (single nucleotide 
polymorphisms or SNPs) located on genes that are collectively associated with the risk of 
progressing to advanced disease in patients with early- or intermediate-stage disease (CFH/CFH 
region, C2, CRFB, ARMS2, C3). A risk score is generated, and the individual is categorized into a 
low, moderate, or high risk group. 
 
Chromosome Conformation Signature 
An example of the new platform to evaluate epigenetic biomarkers (chromosome conformation signatures) is the 
EpiSwitch
™
 (Oxford BioDynamics, Gaithersburg, MD).

In Vitro Companion Diagnostic Devices (IVD) 
According to the FDA, a companion diagnostic is defined as: 
“..a medical device, often an in vitro device, which provides information that is essential for the 
safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or biological product. The test helps a health care 
professional determine whether a particular therapeutic product’s benefits to patients will outweigh 
any potential serious side effects or risks. 
Companion diagnostics can: 
• identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; 
• identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment with a 
particular therapeutic product; or 
• monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of adjusting 
treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness”. 
 
To date, the Guardant360 CDx test has received FDA-approval as a companion diagnostic test in the following 
situations: 
• Testing for EGFR exon 19 deletions, EGFR exon 21 L858R and T790M for individuals with NSCLC 
considering treatment with osimertinib  
• Testing for EGRF exon 20 insertions for individuals with NSCLC considering treatment with amivantamb  
• Testing for G12C in individuals with NSCLC considering treatment with sotorasib  
• Testing for ERBB2 activating mutations in individuals with NSCLC considering treatment with fam-
trastuzumab deruxtecan-nxki  
• Testing for ESR1 missense mutations between codons 310 and 547 in individuals with breast cancer 
considering treatment with elacestrant. 
 
There are numerous companion diagnostic indications for the Foundation One CDx test (tissue-based) and the 
blood-based Foundation One Liquid CDx test.
