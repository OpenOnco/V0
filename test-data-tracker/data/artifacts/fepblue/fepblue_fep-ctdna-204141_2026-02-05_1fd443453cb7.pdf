Biopsy)
Description
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood, referred to as "liquid biopsy," have several potential uses for
guiding therapeutic decisions in patients with cancer or being screened for cancer. This evidence review evaluates uses for liquid biopsies not
addressed in a separate review. If a separate evidence review exists, then conclusions reached there supersede conclusions here.
FEP 2.04.141 Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells for Cancer Management (Liquid Biopsy)
The policies contained in the FEP Medical Policy Manual are developed to assist in administering contractual benefits and do not constitute medical advice. They are not
intended to replace or substitute for the independent medical judgment of a practitioner or other health care professional in the treatment of an individual member. The
Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association does not intend by the FEP Medical Policy Manual, or by any particular medical policy, to recommend, advocate, encourage or
discourage any particular medical technologies. Medical decisions relative to medical technologies are to be made strictly by members/patients in consultation with their

RATIONALE
Summary of Evidence
For individuals who have advanced cancer who receive testing of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to select targeted treatment, the evidence includes
observational studies. Relevant outcomes are overall survival (OS), disease-specific survival, test validity, morbid events, and medication use. Given
the breadth of methodologies available to assess ctDNA, the clinical validity of each commercially available test must be established independently,
and these data are lacking for the indications covered in this review. The clinical validity of FoundationOne Liquid compared to tissue biopsy with
FoundationOne comprehensive genetic profiling was evaluated in 4 industry-sponsored observational studies. Published studies reporting clinical
outcomes and/or clinical utility are lacking. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical utility preclude conclusions about whether variant
analysis of ctDNA can replace variant analysis of tissue. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the
net health outcome.
For individuals who have advanced cancer who receive testing of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) to select targeted treatment, the evidence includes
observational studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication use. Given the
breadth of methodologies available to assess CTCs, the clinical validity of each commercially available test must be established independently, and
these data are lacking. Published studies reporting clinical outcomes and/or clinical utility are lacking. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and
clinical utility preclude conclusions about whether the use of CTCs can replace variant analysis of tissue. The evidence is insufficient to determine that
the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.
For individuals who have cancer who receive testing of ctDNA to monitor treatment response, the evidence includes observational studies. Relevant
outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication use. Given the breadth of methodologies
available to assess ctDNA, the clinical validity of each commercially available test must be established independently, and these data are lacking.
Published studies reporting clinical outcomes and/or clinical utility are lacking. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical utility preclude
conclusions about whether the use of ctDNA should be used to monitor treatment response. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the
technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.
For individuals who have cancer who receive testing of CTCs to monitor treatment response, the evidence includes a single randomized controlled trial
(RCT), observational studies, and systematic reviews of observational studies. Relevant outcomes are OS, disease-specific survival, test accuracy and
validity, morbid events, and medication use. Given the breadth of methodologies available to assess CTCs, the clinical validity of each commercially
available test must be established independently, and these data are lacking. The available RCT found no effect on OS when patients with persistently
increased CTC levels after first-line chemotherapy were switched to alternative cytotoxic therapy. Other studies reporting clinical outcomes and/or
clinical utility are lacking. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical utility preclude conclusions about whether the use of CTCs should be
used to monitor treatment response. The evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology results in an improvement in the net health outcome.

SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION
Practice Guidelines and Position Statements
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in 'Supplemental Information' if they were issued by, or jointly by, a US professional
society, an international society with US representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to guidelines
that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest.
American Society of Clinical Oncology
In 2022, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a Provisional Clinical Opinion on somatic genetic testing in individuals with
metastatic or advanced cancer.
27,
 The Opinion addressed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing under additional topics but did not include a specific
statement with a strength of recommendation rating. The panel noted, "There is a growing body of evidence on the clinical utility of genomic testing on
cfDNA in the plasma," citing the systematic review conducted by Merker et al (2018)
3,
 The panel also noted that ASCO will update that systematic
review over the next few years.
The discussion also included the following points:
"In patients without tissue-based genomic test results, treatment may be based on actionable alterations identified in cfDNA."
"Testing is most helpful when genomic testing is indicated, archival tissue is unavailable, and new tumor biopsies are not feasible."
"cfDNA levels themselves may be prognostic and early cfDNA dynamics may serve as an early predictor of therapy response or resistance."
"Ongoing studies are expected to better delineate the clinical utility of serial liquid biopsies."
National Comprehensive Cancer Network
There is no general National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline on the use of liquid biopsy. Refer to treatment recommendations by
cancer type for specific recommendations.

28,
"Effective for services performed on or after March 16, 2018, the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) has determined that Next
Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a diagnostic laboratory test is reasonable and necessary and covered nationally, when performed in a Clinical
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-certified laboratory, when ordered by a treating physician, and when all of the following requirements are
met:
a. Patient has:
i. either recurrent, relapsed, refractory, metastatic, or advanced stage III or IV cancer; and
ii. not been previously tested with the same test using NGS for the same cancer genetic content, and
iii. decided to seek further cancer treatment (e.g., therapeutic chemotherapy).
b. The diagnostic laboratory test using NGS must have:
i. Food & Drug Administration (FDA) approval or clearance as a companion in vitro diagnostic; and,
ii. an FDA-approved or -cleared indication for use in that patient"s cancer; and,
iii. results provided to the treating physician for management of the patient using a report template to specify treatment options."
