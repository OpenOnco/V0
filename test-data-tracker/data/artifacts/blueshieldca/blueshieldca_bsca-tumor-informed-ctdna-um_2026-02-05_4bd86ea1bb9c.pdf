ipilimumab [Yervoy], nivilumab [Opdivo]}) 
B. Frequency of testing does not exceed recommendations for monitoring noted in National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for RECIST (Response Evaluation 
Criteria in Solid Tumors) for 
any of the following: 
1. Initial testing within 4-6 weeks after surgery as a baseline and for adjuvant therapy 
decisions 
2. Every 3-6 months for the first 2 years initially or with recurrence or progression (not to

Policy Guidelines 
 
This medical policy addresses the use of tumor-informed
 ctDNA MRD testing. The term MRD is 
variously used to describe Molecular, Minimal or Measurable Residual Disease.  In this context, given 
the ctDNA testing used, MRD will be defined as Molecular Residual Disease. 
 
Initial testing includes tumor testing (tumor block or FFPE slides from surgery or biopsy) and whole-
blood testing (to allow matching of whole exome sequencing of tumor and blood DNA), and can take 
35-42 days to complete.  Subsequent monitoring testing is plasma only, based on initial testing 
results and is usually available within 7-14 days. 
 
These tests are specifically designed for the detection of somatic mutations (in cancer) and are not 
appropriate for the identification of heritable germline mutations.  This policy does not address the 
use of blood-based comprehensive genomic profile (CGP) or other testing to identify driver mutations 
to select targeted therapies or use of blood-based testing for gene expression profiling.

Description 
 
This evidence review addresses the use of tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing for 
cancer management. The purpose of tumor-informed ctDNA testing in individuals with cancer is to 
predict disease course to inform treatment decisions and to monitor for recurrence following 
treatment. 
 
NGS-based MRD assays can be either tumor-informed or tumor-agnostic 
• Tumor-informed assays begin with a surgical specimen to determine which tumor-derived 
variants are present and are most amenable to tracking in cell-free DNA. That information 
can then be used to design a targeted NGS panel unique to the patient’s tumor that can be 
used for subsequent monitoring.  
• Tumor-agnostic assays include fixed panels designed to detect a specific number of genomic 
and/or epigenomic alterations commonly associated with a particular tumor type.

To detect MRD, tumor-informed and tumor-agnostic assays both rely on how well a tumor sheds 
DNA into the bloodstream, but tumor-informed approaches have the potential benefit of predicting 
which unique variants in a patient’s tumor are the best alterations to detect and monitor.  In contrast 
to the analysis of tumor biopsy samples, which are not only invasive to obtain but often also do not 
fully capture tumor heterogeneity and evolution, the analysis of ctDNA offers a non-invasive method 
of repeatedly evaluating the genomic profile of a patient’s cancer to monitor for relapse, progression, 
treatment decisions, etc..  
 
First used as a clinical metric in hematological cancers, MRD was historically measured with cell-
based assays such as flow cytometry. Only recently, with the development of highly sensitive 
methods of DNA analysis, has ctDNA in plasma samples been shown to be a reliable biomarker for 
MRD for solid tumors as well.   
 
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a component of cell-free DNA that is shed by malignant tumors 
into the bloodstream and other bodily fluids
1
. Mechanisms of release into the bloodstream include 
cellular apoptosis, necrosis, phagocytosis, and active secretion
2-5
. ctDNA has clinically demonstrated 
the ability to function as a highly sensitive and specific cancer biomarker6-8. Quantitative 
characterization of ctDNA via liquid biopsy is associated with clinical and pathologic features of 
cancer, including stage, tumor burden, vascularization, and response to therapy
6-8.
 The short half-life 
of ctDNA ensures that its detection captures tumor burden in real-time
9-10
. Crucial to its clinical role in 
guiding therapeutic decision-making, the presence of ctDNA is identified as molecular residual 
disease (MRD) which is clinically occult micrometastatic disease that remains in the patient during 
and after cancer treatment11-12. An overwhelming amount of literature suggests that MRD is 
subclinical disease responsible for cancer recurrence.  Quantitative measures of ctDNA via a 
peripheral blood sample has been associated with a high-risk for recurrence but cannot be measured 
by standard clinical imaging techniques or other tumor biomarkers
13-15
.   
 
ctDNA serves as a biomarker for (1) postoperative and post-adjuvant chemotherapy treatment (ACT) 
risk stratification, (2) monitoring ACT effectiveness, (3) detection of clinical actionable mutations, and 
(4) early detection of recurrence. These observations have clinical implications and potential net 
health benefits for postoperative ctDNA-guided management of certain cancers.   
 
Clinicopathologic risk factors have, and continue to dictate the patient selection strategy for 
adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT) in early -stage colorectal (CRC) patients. However, accumulating data 
indicate that the risk-stratification based on standard criteria is imprecise in identifying patients with 
MRD, resulting in overtreatment and undertreatment of a significant number of patients. In fact, 
approximately 50% of the stage III CRC patients and 74% of low-risk stage III CRC patients are cured 
by surgery alone. However, current guidelines recommend ACT for all such patients resulting in 
unnecessary chemotherapy administration in a large proportion of patients, causing a myriad of 
short- and long-term toxicities. Conversely, 5% of stage I CRC and 10-25% of Stage II patients recur; 
however, for Stage I and average-risk stage II patients, there is no available risk-stratification tool to 
identify patients who are likely to recur after curative surgery. Standard methods (e.g., RECIST or 
Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors) for monitoring disease after CRC surgery include 
radiological imaging and analysis of circulating tumor markers such as carcinoembryonic antigen 
(CEA) and serum cancer antigen 125 (CA-125). However, standard imaging detects only macroscopic 
disease, and the sensitivity and specificity of CEA and CA-125 are poor.   Therefore, a biomarker that 
can identify earlier and more reliably patients with MRD is of critical importance in refining patient 
selection for adjuvant therapy.

Rationale 
 
Background 
The purpose of tumor-informed ctDNA testing in individuals with cancer is to predict disease course 
to inform treatment decisions and to monitor for recurrence following treatment. 
 
In addition to colorectal cancer (CRC), MRD testing has been performed in multiple cancer types. 
Validation studies for the use of MRD testing have been done for lung, breast, bladder, melanoma, 
cervical and esophageal cancers, among others. MRD testing across multiple cancer types 
demonstrates consistent sensitivity and specificity (ranging from 88-100% sensitivity and 98-100% 
specificity). Although the size, parameters, type of cancer and specific tests used for various studies 
varies, the results are consistent.  Moreover, in these studies, ctDNA has shown significant lead time 
over radiographic imaging for the detection of relapse, and better performance than other standard 
indicators. In TRAcking non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Evolution through therapy (TRACERx), a 
prospective study the median interval between ctDNA detection and detection of relapse by imaging 
was 70 days (range 10 to 346 days); in some of these cases, lead times of more than 6 months were 
noted. 
 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management

Another longitudinal study in breast cancer patients found that plasma ctDNA was detected before 
clinical or radiologic relapse in 16 of 18 relapsed patients; in addition, ctDNA predicted metastatic 
relapse with a lead time of up to 2 years.  A prospective study evaluating ctDNA before and after 
surgery and during chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced bladder cancer found that the 
measurement of ctDNA during treatment is a good predictor of outcome and a better predictor of 
treatment efficacy than pathologic downstaging (a commonly used surrogate marker). Moreover, in 
this study, patients without clearance of ctDNA had a response rate of 0%.  ctDNA has also been 
shown to accurately monitor the activity and diagnose recurrence of endometrial cancer.  Multiple 
studies have found it to be highly sensitive for monitoring and predicting disease progression and 
response to therapy in patients with metastatic melanoma.  
 
Immune check point inhibitors (ICI) have emerged as an effective therapy and have been approved 
for various types of solid tumor malignancies. However, in most settings only a minority of patients 
respond to immunotherapy. FDA labels for ICI therapies call for treatment until disease progression 
or unacceptable toxicity. However, there is no definitive guidance on the method for evaluation of 
disease progression, which leaves this decision up to the judgement of clinicians prescribing these 
drugs, often without reliable objective measurements. 
 
The determination as to whether a tumor is progressing is currently based largely on repeated 
radiographic evaluation of the tumor (sometimes combined with other biomarkers). While tumor 
growth is often associated with progression, this is complicated by pseudo-progression, where 
immune cell infiltration may cause the tumor to initially appear larger on a scan prior to shrinking, 
making it difficult to know in a timely fashion who is responding to treatment and who is not based 
on radiographic imaging and complicating patient management. 
 
A recent (2022) study related to the use of ctDNA found that a ctDNA-guided approach compared to 
standard clinicopathological features for the treatment of stage II colon cancer reduced adjuvant 
chemotherapy use without compromising recurrence-free survival. 
 
MRD testing using ctDNA is not without limitations and challenges in interpretation.  There are 
limited studies reporting management changes made in response to ctDNA test results or net health 
outcomes based solely on ctDNA results, including long term outcomes.   The sample sizes are small 
for some studies for certain cancers or for a particular test.  And standard evaluations, management 
and treatments vary by type of cancer, meaning that test results need to be assessed with those 
differences in mind.  Yet when considered in aggregate, the results are consistent and compelling.  
Because of the limitations noted, testing is currently most likely to be used in addition to standard 
approaches until further evidence emerges.  However, given the significant limitations of current 
monitoring standards, there is still a place for ctDNA to add to the information available to clinicians 
for critical decision making.   
 
Signatera (Natera) and Personalized Cancer Monitoring (PCM, Invitae) 
Both tests are customized tumor-specific ctDNA test. Tumor tissue obtained from either a diagnostic 
biopsy or surgically resected tissue is used to identify 16 (for Signatera) or 18-50 (for PCM) single 
nucleotide variants found in the tumor but not in normal tissue and are likely to be present in all 
tumor cells regardless of tumor evolution. A custom assay of those tumor-specific clonal, somatic 
variants is generated for the individual and the resulting tumor signature can be monitored 
throughout the individual’s disease course. When the test is used for detection of recurrence following 
curative treatment, plasma samples with a few of these variants detected above a predefined 
confidence threshold are deemed to be positive. When the test is used to monitor treatment 
response, evaluation is based on whether ctDNA levels increase or decrease from a baseline 
measurement. The tests are currently intended to be used in conjunction with radiological 
assessment in most cases.

Literature Review 
Evidence reviews assess whether a medical test is clinically useful. The first step in assessing a 
medical test is to formulate the clinical context and purpose of the test. A useful test provides 
information to make a clinical management decision that improves the net health outcome. That is, 
the balance of benefits and harms is better when the test is used to manage the condition than when 
another test or no test is used to manage the condition. 
 
A test is clinically useful if the use of the results informs management decisions that improve the net 
health outcome of care. The net health outcome can be improved if individuals receive correct 
therapy, or more effective therapy, or avoid unnecessary therapy, or avoid unnecessary testing. 
 
Direct evidence of clinical utility is provided by studies that have compared health outcomes for 
individuals managed with and without the test. Because these are intervention studies, the preferred 
evidence would be from randomized controlled trials. 
 
Indirect evidence on clinical utility rests on clinical validity. If the evidence is insufficient to 
demonstrate test performance, no inferences can be made about clinical utility. 
 
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) 
Clinical Context and Test Purpose 
The purpose of tumor-informed ctDNA testing in individuals who have colorectal cancer is to inform 
treatment decisions and to monitor for recurrence following curative treatment. 
 
The question addressed in this evidence review is: Does tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) testing improve the net health outcome in individuals with colorectal cancer? 
 
The following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review. 
 
Populations 
The relevant populations of interest are individuals: 
• With stage II or III colorectal cancer who have undergone surgical resection. 
• Who are being monitored for relapse following treatment for stage II or III colorectal cancer. 
• With metastatic (stage IV) colorectal cancer who have undergone surgical resection and are 
being evaluated for adjuvant chemotherapy and/or targeted therapy. 
 
Interventions 
The test being considered is ctDNA testing with Signatera or PCM: 
• Following surgery, to inform decisions about adjuvant chemotherapy or targeted therapy. 
• During disease surveillance after curative treatment, to identify metastatic relapse at an 
early timepoint, and aid in the selection of individuals who may benefit from early/adjuvant 
treatment. 
 
Comparators 
For individuals with stage II colorectal cancer, the current standard of care is not to routinely 
administer adjuvant chemotherapy. However, current National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
(NCCN) guidelines are that adjuvant chemotherapy can be considered in individuals with stage II 
colorectal cancer, using clinicopathologic characteristics to identify individuals who might benefit. 
 
For individuals with stage III colorectal cancer, the current standard of care is to administer adjuvant 
chemotherapy routinely. 
 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management 
Page 7 of 50

For individuals who are being monitored for relapse following treatment for stage II or III colorectal 
cancer, guidelines suggest monitoring carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) every 3 to 6 months for 2 
years, then every 6 months for a total of 5 years, as well as imaging every 6 to 12 months for 5 years. 
 
For individuals with metastatic colorectal cancer who have undergone surgical resection, the current 
standard of care is routine individual checkups, periodic computed tomography scans, and 
monitoring of CEA level. 
 
Outcomes 
The general outcomes of interest are disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, and change 
in disease status. Specific outcomes of interest are recurrence risk, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and 
overall survival at follow-up.   
 
Given that the majority of colorectal cancer recurrences occur within the first 3 years after surgical 
resection of the primary tumor and approximately 95% in the first 5 years, the timepoint of interest to 
assess recurrence is 3 to 5 years following surgical resection. 
 
For individuals with stage II colorectal cancer who are being evaluated for adjuvant chemotherapy, 
given that the test will be used to  
rule  -in stage II individuals for adjuvant chemotherapy, the 
perfomance characteristics of most interest are positive predictive value and specificity. 
 
For individuals with stage III colorectal cancer who are being evaluated for adjuvant chemotherapy, 
given that the test will be used to 
rule  -out individuals for adjuvant chemotherapy, the performance 
characteristics of most interest are negative predictive value and sensitivity. However, since the test 
would be used to select individuals who would not receive category 1 recommended treatment, direct 
evidence of improvement in outcomes is required. For individuals who are being monitored for 
relapse following treatment for colorectal cancer, recurrence at 3 to 5 years should be assessed. 
 
Study Selection Criteria 
For the evaluation of clinical validity of the Signatera or PCM test   s, studies that meet the following 
eligibility criteria were considered: 
• Reported on the accuracy of the marketed version of the technology 
• Included a suitable reference standard 
• Individual/sample clinical characteristics were described 
• Individual/sample selection criteria were described. 
 
Trials 
Two randomized and nine nonrandomized studies examined the association of tumor-informed 
ctDNA testing to prognosis, DFS, recurrence, ctDNA dynamics and treatment response in individuals 
with colorectal cancer (CRC) (Table 1). They differed in their study designs, populations (e.g., stage of 
disease), frequency and timing of standard care, outcome measures, and timing of follow up. Nine 
studies evaluated the association of ctDNA results (positive and negative) and risk for recurrence 
(disease free survival) in CRC (Table 2). Five studies reveal ctDNA results for early relapse detection as 
compared to CT Imaging (Table 3).  Clinical findings from all 11 studies demonstrate clinical utility 
benefits for risk stratification for therapy selection, monitoring response to therapy, or early relapse 
detection in patients with resected CRC (table 4). 
 
Randomized Trials 
Tie, et al (2022) conducted an Australian trial to assess whether a ctDNA-guided approach could 
reduce the use of adjuvant chemotherapy without compromising recurrence risk.  The study 
enrolled 
455 patients (322 for ctDNA and 153 standard) with medial followup of 37 months.  About half of 
the ctDNA group got adjuvant therapy compared to standard (15 vs 28%).  Yet ctDNA guided 
management was similar to standard for 2 year recurrence-free survival (93.5 vs. 92.4%).  Three-
year recurrence-free survival was 86.4% among ctDNA-positive patients who received adjuvant 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management

chemotherapy and 92.5% among ctDNA-negative patients who did not.  The study authors 
concluded “A ctDNA-guided approach to the treatment of stage II colon cancer reduced adjuvant 
chemotherapy use without compromising recurrencefree survival.”
 
 
Nonrandomized Trials 
Four nonrandomized studies, 3 of which were noncomparative, examined the association of 
Signatera testing to prognosis in individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) (Table 1). They differed in 
their study designs, populations (e.g., stage of disease), frequency and timing of standard care, 
outcome measures, and timing of follow up. Three studies evaluated the association between 
positive ctDNA results and prognosis in CRC (Table 2). These studies did not provide comparisons of 
ctDNA testing to standard methods of risk stratification for therapy selection, monitoring response to 
therapy, or early relapse detection. One retrospective study compared Signatera testing to other 
surveillance strategies in individuals with resected colorectal cancer.
2,
 There are limited randomized 
controlled trials, and studies in which Signatera testing was used to guide treatment decisions. 
 
Reinert et al (2019) enrolled 125 individuals with stage I to III colorectal cancer in a validation study of 
the Signatera assay.
3,
 Plasma samples were collected before surgery, at 30 days following surgery, 
and every 3 months for up to 3 years. The recurrence rate at 3 years was 70% in individuals with a 
positive ctDNA test (7 of 10) compared to 11.9% (10 of 84) of those with a negative ctDNA test. In 
multivariate analyses, ctDNA status was associated with recurrence after adjusting for 
clinicopathological risk factors including stage, lymphovascular invasion, and microradical resection 
status. 
 
Henriksen et al (2022) assessed the added benefit of serial ctDNA analysis; with samples taken at 
diagnosis, following surgery, during adjuvant therapy, and at follow up.
4, 
 
Loupakis et al (2021) evaluated the association of ctDNA with Signatera on survival outcomes in 112 
individuals who had undergone resection for metastatic (stage IV) CRC.
5,
 The study included an 
analysis of the sensitivity of Signatera testing to digital droplet PCR testing but not to standard 
methods to identify recurrence, such as CEA and imaging. 
 
Fakih et al (2022) directly compared Signatera testing to other surveillance strategies in individuals 
with resected CRC in a retrospective observational study (Table 3).
2,
 This study was unique in that it 
used NCCN recommended guidelines for surveillance and ctDNA testing was performed at the same 
interval as standard surveillance with CEA and imaging. Test characteristics for Signatera were not 
significantly different from standard imaging techniques. Estimates were imprecise, with wide 
confidence intervals. 
 
Tie et al (2016) investigated whether serial postsurgical and postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis could 
provide a real-time indication of adjuvant therapy efficacy in stage III colon cancer. This multicenter 
Australian trial recruited 100 consecutive patients (4 were excluded) with newly diagnosed stage III 
colon cancer. Median duration of follow  -up was 28.9 months (range, 11.6-46.4 months). Main 
outcomes and measures included detection of ctDNA and recurrence-free interval (RFI). At least 1 
somatic mutation was identified in the tumor tissue of all 96 evaluable patients. Circulating tumor 
DNA was detectable in 20 of 96 (21%) postsurgical samples and was associated with inferior 
recurrence-free survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; 95% CI, 2.4-21.0; P < .001). Circulating tumor DNA was 
detectable in 15 of 88 (17%) postchemotherapy samples. The estimated 3-year RFI was 30% when 
ctDNA was detectable after chemotherapy and 77% when ctDNA was undetectable (HR, 6.8; 95% CI, 
11.0  -157.0; P < .001). Postsurgical ctDNA status remained independently associated with RFI after 
adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk factors (HR, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-16.1; P < .001). The authors 
concluded “Results suggest that ctDNA analysis after surgery is a promising prognostic marker in 
stage III colon cancer. Postchemotherapy ctDNA analysis may define a patient subset that remains 
at high risk of recurrence despite completing standard adjuvant treatment. This high-risk population 
presents a unique opportunity to explore additional therapeutic approaches.”

Study limitations are shown in Tables 4 and 5. Major limitations include a lack of comparison to tests 
used for the same purpose, imprecise estimates due to small sample sizes, and clinical heterogeneity 
of study populations.

Study Major Findings Conclusions & Relevance 
Reinert et 
al
16 
At postoperative day 30, ctDNA-positive 
patients were 7 times more likely to relapse 
than ctDNA-negative patients (hazard ratio 
[HR], 7.2; 95% CI, 2.7-19.0; P < .001). 
 
After ACT ctDNA-positive patients were 17 
times (HR, 17.5; 95% CI, 5.4-56.5; P < .001) more 
likely to relapse. 
 
During surveillance after definitive therapy, 
ctDNA-positive patients were more than 40 
times more likely to experience disease 
recurrence than ctDNA-negative patients (HR, 
43.5; 95% CI, 9.8-193.5 P < .001).  
 
In all multivariate analyses, ctDNA status was 
independently associated with relapse after 
adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk 
factors. Serial ctDNA analyses revealed 
disease recurrence up to 16.5 months ahead of 
standard-of-care radiologic imaging 
 
 
The study reported that longitudinal ctDNA 
analysis in patients with stages I to III CRC 
can effectively detect and monitor changes 
in tumor burden throughout the clinical 
disease course 
 
Results show that ctDNA serves as a robust 
biomarker for (1) postoperative and post-ACT 
risk stratification, (2) monitoring ACT 
effectiveness, (3) detection of clinical 
actionable mutations, and (4) early detection 
of recurrence.  
 
The study found that in multivariate analysis 
ctDNA status (among stage, CEA, and other 
high-risk factors) was the only significant 
factor associated with recurrence. This 
suggests that ctDNA analysis may be a 
better tool for identifying high risk patients.  
  
The study provides first-line evidence that 
ACT can reduce the risk of recurrence in 
ctDNA-positive patients.

Detection of ctDNA was a strong recurrence 
predictor postoperatively [HR = 7.0; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 3.7–13.5; P < 0.001] and 
directly after ACT (HR = 50.76; 95% CI, 15.4–

treatment was similarly predictive of 
recurrence (HR = 50.80; 95% CI, 14.9–172; 
P<0.001) 
 
The recurrence rate of postoperative ctDNA-
positive patients treated with ACT was 80%. 
Only patients who cleared ctDNA permanently 
during ACT did not relapse. 
 
Serial ctDNA analysis every 3 months detected 
recurrence with a median lead-time of 9.8 
months compared with standard-of-care 
computed tomography 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The current study demonstrated ctDNA as a 
strong prognostic marker immediately post-
ACT. 
 
The results suggest that radiological 
surveillance may be deescalated in low-risk 
(ctDNA-negative) patients with no/minimal 
effect on the outcome. For high-risk (ctDNA-
positive) patients, there is an opportunity for 
intensifying imaging immediately upon 
ctDNA detection. 
 
The analysis comparing concurrent ctDNA 
and CT imaging assessments showed that in 
33% of patients, who later recurred, ctDNA 
was detected at a time where no recurrence 
was visible by CT imaging. This indicates that 
ctDNA measurements in some cases may be 
more sensitive for recurrence detection than 
standard CT imaging 
 
ctDNA was the strongest prognostic marker 
in multivariable analysis with conventionally 
used risk markers. The findings are consistent 
with and extend on previous colorectal 
cancer studies

recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to 
those with a ctDNA-negative status [HR, 18; 
95% confidence interval (CI), 7.9 to 40; P = 2.6 
× 10−12]. Kaplan-Meier estimates of RFS at 3 
years were 0% for the ctDNA-positive and 
90% for the ctDNA-negative groups. 
 
Postoperative ctDNA status had a greater 
impact on RFS than any individual 
clinicopathological risk factor or any 
combination of clinicopathological factors. 
Postoperative ctDNA status added significant 
prognostic value to patients classified as 
either low-risk or high-risk on the basis of 
clinicopathological factors (low-risk: HR, 28; 
95% CI, 8.1 to 93; P = 9.2 × 10−8; high-risk: HR, 
7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22; P = 0.0002). 
 
 
After multivariable adjustment, postoperative 
ctDNA status remained an independent 
predictor of RFS for patients not treated with 
chemotherapy (HR, 28; 95% CI, 11 to 68) and 
for all patients (HR, 14; 95% CI, 6.8 to 28) 
 
ctDNA positivity immediately after completion 
of chemotherapy was associated with poorer 
RFS (HR, 11; 95% CI, 1.8 to 68; P = 0.001) 
 
The median lead time from ctDNA detection 
to radiological recurrence was over 5 months, 
which might be sufficient to change patient 
management. 
 
 
 
 
 
positive postoperatively are at extremely 
high risk of radiologic recurrence (HR, 18; 95% 
CI, 7.9 to 40; P = 2.6 × 10−12) when not 
treated with chemotherapy. 
 
Conversely, patients with negative ctDNA 
postoperatively were at a low risk of 
radiologic recurrence (3-year RFS of 90%), 
not dissimilar to patients with stage I 
colorectal cancer, defining a group where 
adjuvant therapy is less likely to be helpful. 
 
The prognostic impact of postoperative 
ctDNA status was independent of individual 
clinicopathological risk features and 
improved the RFS risk estimates for both 
patients with clinicopathologic low (HR, 28; 
95% CI, 8.1 to 93) and high-risk features (HR, 
7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22). 
 
The study also demonstrated that being 
ctDNA-positive at the completion of 
adjuvant chemotherapy treatment predicted 
a very high risk of radiologic recurrence. 
 
The findings that postoperative ctDNA is a 
robust predictor of disease recurrence is 
consistent with recent reports in other tumor 
types.  
 
This ctDNA measurement is superior to 
clinicopathological measures currently used 
to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. 
 
ctDNA detection after stage II colon cancer 
resection provides direct evidence of residual 
disease and identifies patients at very high 
risk of recurrence. 
Tie et al
11 
Significantly worse recurrence-free survival 
was seen if ctDNA was detectable after 
chemoradiotherapy (HR 6.6; P<0.001) or after 
surgery (HR 13.0; P<0.001). 
 
The estimated 3-year recurrence-free survival 
was 33% for the postoperative ctDNA -
positive patients and 87% for the 
postoperative ctDNA -negative patients. 
 
Postoperative ctDNA detection was predictive 
of recurrence irrespective of adjuvant 
chemotherapy use (chemotherapy: HR 10.0; 
P<0.001; without chemotherapy: HR 22.0; 
P<0.001) 
 
Postoperative ctDNA status remained an 
independent predictor of recurrence-free 
survival after adjusting for known 
clinicopathological risk factors (HR 6.0; 
P<0.001). 
This study provides the first evidence that 
circulating tumor DNA analysis after curative 
intent surgery for locally advanced rectal 
cancer could stratify patients into subsets at 
very high risk or low risk of recurrence. 
 
The strong prognostic impact of 
postoperative circulating tumor DNA status 
appears to be independent of other known 
pathological risk factors.

Detection of ctDNA after surgery and in serial 
plasma samples during follow-up were 
associated with poorer disease-free survival 
(DFS) [hazard ratio (HR), 17.56; log-rank P = 
0.0014 and HR, 11.33; log-rank P = 0.0001, 
respectively]. 
 
In patients treated with adjuvant 
chemotherapy, presence of ctDNA after 
therapy was associated with early relapse (HR 
10.02; log-rank P < 0.0001).  
 
Detection of ctDNA at follow-up preceded 
radiological recurrence with a median lead 
time of 11.5 months. 
 
ctDNA was the only significantly independent 
predictor of DFS in multivariable analysis. 
Plasma postoperative ctDNA detected MRD 
and identified patients at high risk of relapse 
in localized CC. 
 
The data showed the presence of 
postoperative ctDNA establishes a stronger 
prognostic marker than conventional 
pathological factors such as stage.  
 
The findings are consistent with previous 
studies, which have already shown that 
ctDNA after surgery can be a biomarker of 
MRD and therefore a prognostic factor for 
recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer.

Patients with detectable postoperative ctDNA 
experienced a significantly lower RFS (HR 6.3; 
95% CI 2.58 to 15.2; P < 0.001) and overall 
survival (HR 4.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 11.8; P < 0.001) 
compared to patients with undetectable 
ctDNA 
 
All patients with detectable postoperative 
ctDNA who failed to clear their ctDNA 
following adjuvant chemotherapy experienced 
recurrence, while 67% of patients whose 
ctDNA became undetectable after 
chemotherapy remained disease-free 
 
End   -of-treatment (surgery +/− adjuvant 
chemotherapy) ctDNA detection was 
associated with a 5-year RFS of 0% compared 
to 75.6% for patients with an undetectable 
end  -of-treatment ctDNA (HR 14.9; 95% CI 4.94 
to 44.7; P < 0.001). 
We confirmed the prognostic impact of post-
surgery and post-treatment ctDNA in 
patients with resected CRLM.  
 
The potential utility of serial ctDNA analysis 
during adjuvant chemotherapy as an early 
marker of treatment efficacy was also 
demonstrated 
 
ctDNA detection after surgery or after 
completion of adjuvant chemotherapy is 
associated with a very high risk of recurrence 
and    death in patients with resectable CRLM 
 
ctDNA dynamics before and after adjuvant 
chemotherapy reflected adjuvant treatment 
efficacy.

(hazard ratio [HR]: 5.8; 95% CI, 3.5 to 9.7; P <

MRD-positive status was also associated with 
an inferior overall survival: HR: 16.0; 95% CI, 3.9

At the time of analyses, 96% (49 of 51) of 
patients were alive in the MRD-negative arm 
compared with 52.4% (32 of 61) in the MRD-
positive arm. 
 
Patients who did not receive systemic therapy 
and were MRD-negative in the combined 
ctDNA analysis at two time points had an

This study confirms that in mCRC undergoing

analysis is a strong prognostic biomarker 
 
The present work supports the continuous 
expansion of the number of clinical studies in 
patients with mCRC using personalized 
ctDNA-based MRD analysis and provides 
direct evidence of the predictive and 
prognostic value of ctDNA, which could help 
clinicians and researchers with real numbers 
to design their clinical studies and support 
therapeutic decisions in the adjuvant setting

Surveillance with CEA measurement appeared 
to perform poorly in detecting a first 
recurrence, with a sensitivity of only 20.0% 
(95% CI, 5.3%-48.6%).  
 
Circulating tumor DNA did not appear to 
perform numerically better than imaging, with 
sensitivities of 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 
60.0% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), (P > .99), 
respectively.  
 
The specificity was the highest for ctDNA at 
100% (95% CI, 87.0%-100%) 
 
When combining imaging and measurement 
of CEA levels, as recommended by NCCN 
guidelines, the combination modality had a 
numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in 
identifying a recurrence (sensitivity, 73.3% 
[95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%]; P = .55) and performed 
well on both the PPV (73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-
91.1%] vs 100% [95% CI, 59.8%-100%]) and 
NPV (87.9% [95% CI, 70.9%- 96.0%] vs 82.5% 
[95% CI, 66.6%-92.1%]). 
 
Statistical analysis showed that the sensitivity 
of CEA surveillance was significantly worse 
than that of combined imaging and 
measurement of CEA levels (20.0% [95% CI, 
5.3%-48.6%]; P = .01). 
 
No significant difference was noted among 
ctDNA (median, 14.3 months), imaging 
(median, 15.0 months), or imaging plus 
measurement of CEA levels (median, 15.0 
months) in the time to identify disease 
recurrence. 
The findings of this prospective cohort study 
suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide 
definitive advantages as a surveillance 
strategy compared with standard imaging 
combined with measurement of CEA levels 
when performed per NCCN guidelines. 
However, a positive ctDNA finding without 
doubt indicates an almost definitive risk of 
relapse.

 Circulating tumor DNA was detectable in 20 of 
96 (21%) postsurgical samples and was 
associated with inferior recurrence-free 
survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; 95% CI, 2.4-
21.0; P < .001) 
 
In this multicenter cohort study of 96 patients 
with stage III colon cancer, a significant 
difference in 3-year recurrence-free interval 
was observed in patients with detectable vs 
undetectable levels of circulating tumor DNA 
after surgery (47% vs 76%)  
 
The estimated 3-year RFI was 30% when 
ctDNA was detectable after chemotherapy 
and    77% when ctDNA was undetectable (HR, 
6.8; 95% CI, 11.0-157.0; P < .001) 
 
Results suggest that ctDNA analysis after 
surgery is a promising prognostic marker in 
stage III colon cancer. Post chemotherapy 
ctDNA analysis may define a patient subset 
that remains at high risk of recurrence 
despite completing standard adjuvant 
treatment.

455 patients underwent randomization, 302 
were assigned to ctDNA-guided management 
and 153 to standard of care management 
 
A lower percentage of patients in the ctDNA-
guided group than in the standard-
management group received adjuvant 
chemotherapy (15% vs. 28%; relative risk, 1.82; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.65). 
 
In the evaluation of 2-year recurrence-free 
survival, ctDNA-guided management was 
noninferior to standard management (93.5% 
and 92.4%, respectively; absolute difference, 1.1 
percentage points; 95% CI, −4.1 to 6.2 
[noninferiority margin, −8.5 percentage 
points]). 
 
Three-year recurrence-free survival was 86.4% 
among ctDNA-positive patients who received 
adjuvant chemotherapy and 92.5% among 
ctDNA-negative patients who did not. 
 
Among ctDNA-negative patients, 3-year 
recurrence-free survival was higher among 
patients with clinical low-risk cancers than 
among those with high-risk cancers (96.7% vs. 
85.1%; hazard ratio, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.26 to 7.34) 
 
3-year recurrence-free survival was higher 
among patients with T3 tumors than among 
those with T4 tumors (94.2% vs. 81.3%; hazard 
ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.01 to 6.71) 
 
 
 
 
 
 
In this trial, we found that a ctDNA-guided 
approach reduced the number of patients 
who received adjuvant therapy and did not 
alter the risk of recurrence. 
 
ctDNA positive patients appeared to derive 
considerable benefit from adjuvant 
treatment, given the low percentage of 
patients with recurrence in this trial as 
compared with previously reported high 
recurrence rates in this subgroup of patients 
when no adjuvant chemotherapy was 
administered 
 
The study confirmed the very low risk of 
recurrence in untreated ctDNA-negative 
patient 
 
Most notable was the 3-year recurrence-free 
survival of 96.7% among patients with low-
risk disease, indicating that adjuvant therapy 
sho  uld not be considered for ctDNA negative 
patients who are at clinicopathological low 
risk. This is an important observation, 
because in routine clinical practice adjuvant 
chemotherapy is still administered to some 
patients at low risk (11% in our standard-
management group), particularly younger 
patients 
 
The results of this trial suggest that a survival 
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy may be 
obtained in a well-defined subgroup of 
patients with stage II colon cancer — 
namely, those with detectable ctDNA after 
surgery 
 
A ctDNA-guided approach to the treatment 
of stage II colon cancer reduced adjuvant 
chemotherapy use without compromising 
recurrence-free survival.

GALAXY enrolled 1,564 patients, of whom 1,040 
(the “outcome cohort”) were included in the 
current analysis. 
 
Patients who tested positive for ctDNA 4 
weeks after surgery had an 11- to 13-times 
increased risk for recurrence. 
 
The assay’s sensitivity for disease recurrence 
was calculated at 63.6% for the analysis of 
patients with stage I to IV disease and 67.6% 
for those with stage II to III disease. 
 
The study shows that stratifying post-
surgical treatment decisions using the ctDNA 
assay can identify patients likely to benefit 
from ACT across all stages of disease, 
including pStage II.

Study Major Findings Conclusions & Relevance 
The multivariate analysis showed the risk of 
recurrence for patients with stage II to III 
tumors was highly correlated with ctDNA 
positivity at 4 weeks after surgery (hazard 
ratio [HR] = 15.3; P < .001).  
 
Patients with baseline ctDNA positivity who 
remained positive over the course of 
treatment had an almost 16-fold increased 
risk of disease recurrence 
 
Patients who did not clear their ctDNA 
between 4- and 12-weeks during adjuvant 
chemotherapy had significantly worse 
outcomes relative to those who cleared their 
ctDNA—i.e., “positive to positive” (58.3%) vs 
“positive to negative” (100%)—exhibiting a 
15.8  -fold increased risk.  
 
The disease-free survival rate for ctDNA-
negative patients that remained negative was 
98% and for those who turned positive 62.5%. 
 
For patients with high-risk stage II, stage III, 
and stage IV disease, adjuvant chemotherapy 
yielded a benefit among patients who tested 
positive for ctDNA 4 weeks after surgery, with 
hazard ratios of 9.4 (P = .04), 8.8 (P < .001), and 
2.4 (P = .02), respectively.  
 
Patients with high-risk stage II to III disease 
who tested negative for ctDNA at 4 weeks, on 
the other hand, had excellent outcomes, 
whether or not they received chemotherapy, 
with a disease-free survival of approximately 
95% at 12 months.

At postoperative day 30, ctDNA-positive 
patients were 7 times more likely to relapse 
than ctDNA-negative patients (hazard ratio 
[HR], 7.2; 95% CI, 2.7-19.0; P < .001). 
 
After ACT ctDNA-positive patients were 17 
times (HR, 17.5; 95% CI, 5.4-56.5; P < .001) more 
likely to relapse. 
 
During surveillance after definitive therapy, 
ctDNA-positive patients were more than 40 
times more likely to experience disease 
recurrence than ctDNA-negative patients (HR, 
43.5; 95% CI, 9.8-193.5 P < .001).  
 
In all multivariate analyses, ctDNA status was 
independently associated with relapse after 
adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk 
factors. Serial ctDNA analyses revealed 
disease recurrence up to 16.5 months ahead of 
standard-of-care radiologic imaging 
 
 
The study reported that longitudinal ctDNA 
analysis in patients with stages I to III CRC 
can effectively detect and monitor changes 
in tumor burden throughout the clinical 
disease course 
 
Results show that ctDNA serves as a robust 
biomarker for (1) postoperative and post-ACT 
risk stratification, (2) monitoring ACT 
effectiveness, (3) detection of clinical 
actionable mutations, and (4) early detection 
of recurrence.  
 
The study found that in multivariate analysis 
ctDNA status (among stage, CEA, and other 
high-risk factors) was the only significant 
factor associated with recurrence. This 
suggests that ctDNA analysis may be a 
better tool for identifying high risk patients.  
  
The study provides first-line evidence that 
ACT can reduce the risk of recurrence in 
ctDNA-positive patients.  
Henriksen et 
al

Detection of ctDNA was a strong recurrence 
predictor postoperatively [HR = 7.0; 95% 
confidence interval (CI), 3.7–13.5; P < 0.001] and 
directly after ACT (HR = 50.76; 95% CI, 15.4–
167; P < 0.001). 
 
Serial ctDNA assessment after the end of 
treatment was similarly predictive of 
The current study demonstrated ctDNA as a 
st rong prognostic marker immediately post-
ACT. 
 
The results suggest that radiological 
surveillance may be deescalated in low-risk 
(ctDNA-negative) patients with no/minimal 
effect on the outcome. For high-risk (ctDNA-
positive) patients, there is an opportunity for

recurrence (HR = 50.80; 95% CI, 14.9–172; 
P<0.001) 
 
The recurrence rate of postoperative ctDNA-
positive patients treated with ACT was 80%. 
Only patients who cleared ctDNA permanently 
during ACT did not relapse. 
 
Serial ctDNA analysis every 3 months detected 
recurrence with a median lead-time of 9.8 
months compared with standard-of-care 
computed tomography 
 
 
intensifying imaging immediately upon 
ctDNA detection. 
 
The analysis comparing concurrent ctDNA 
and CT imaging assessments showed that in 
33% of patients, who later recurred, ctDNA 
was detected at a time where no recurrence 
was visible by CT imaging. This indicates that 
ctDNA measurements in some cases may be 
more sensitive for recurrence detection than 
standard CT imaging 
 
ctDNA was the strongest prognostic marker 
in multivariable analysis with conventionally 
used risk markers. The findings are consistent 
with and extend on previous colorectal 
cancer studies 
Tie et al
29 
Patients with ctDNA-positive status 
postoperatively had a markedly reduced 
recurrence-free survival (RFS) compared to 
those with a ctDNA-negative status [HR, 18; 
95% confidence interval (CI), 7.9 to 40; P = 2.6 
× 10−12]. Kaplan-Meier estimates of RFS at 3 
years were 0% for the ctDNA-positive and 
90% for the ctDNA-negative groups. 
 
Postoperative ctDNA status had a greater 
impact on RFS than any individual 
clinicopathological risk factor or any 
combination of clinicopathological factors. 
Postoperative ctDNA status added significant 
prognostic value to patients classified as 
either low-risk or high-risk on the basis of 
clinicopathological factors (low-risk: HR, 28; 
95% CI, 8.1 to 93; P = 9.2 × 10−8; high-risk: HR, 
7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22; P = 0.0002). 
 
 
After multivariable adjustment, postoperative 
ctDNA status remained an independent 
predictor of RFS for patients not treated with 
chemotherapy (HR, 28; 95% CI, 11 to 68) and 
for all patients (HR, 14; 95% CI, 6.8 to 28) 
 
ctDNA positivity immediately after completion 
of chemotherapy was associated with poorer 
RFS (HR, 11; 95% CI, 1.8 to 68; P = 0.001) 
 
The median lead time from ctDNA detection 
to radiological recurrence was over 5 months, 
which might be sufficient to change patient 
management. 
 
 
 
 
 
The study has demonstrated that stage II 
colon cancer patients who were ctDNA-
positive postoperatively are at extremely 
high risk of radiologic recurrence (HR, 18; 95% 
CI, 7.9 to 40; P = 2.6 × 10−12) when not 
treated with chemotherapy. 
 
Conversely, patients with negative ctDNA 
postoperatively were at a low risk of 
radiologic recurrence (3-year RFS of 90%), 
not dissimilar to patients with stage I 
colorectal cancer, defining a group where 
adjuvant therapy is less likely to be helpful. 
 
The prognostic impact of postoperative 
ctDNA status was independent of individual 
clinicopathological risk features and 
improved the RFS risk estimates for both 
patients with clinicopathologic low (HR, 28; 
95% CI, 8.1 to 93) and high-risk features (HR, 
7.5; 95% CI, 2.6 to 22). 
 
The study also demonstrated that being 
ctDNA-positive at the completion of 
adjuvant chemotherapy treatment predicted 
a very high risk of radiologic recurrence. 
 
The findings that postoperative ctDNA is a 
robust predictor of disease recurrence is 
consistent with recent reports in other tumor 
types.  
 
This ctDNA measurement is superior to 
clinicopathological measures currently used 
to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions. 
 
ctDNA detection after stage II colon cancer 
resection provides direct evidence of residual 
disease and identifies patients at very high 
risk of recurrence. 
Tie et al

Significantly worse recurrence-free survival 
was seen if ctDNA was detectable after 
This study provides the first evidence that

chemoradiotherapy (HR 6.6; P<0.001) or after 
surgery (HR 13.0; P<0.001). 
 
The estimated 3-year recurrence-free survival 
was 33% for the postoperative ctDNA -
positive patients and 87% for the 
postoperative ctDNA -negative patients. 
 
Postoperative ctDNA detection was predictive 
of recurrence irrespective of adjuvant 
chemotherapy use (chemotherapy: HR 10.0; 
P<0.001; without chemotherapy: HR 22.0; 
P<0.001) 
 
Postoperative ctDNA status remained an 
independent predictor of recurrence-free 
survival after adjusting for known 
clinicopathological risk factors (HR 6.0; 
P<0.001). 
 
intent surgery for locally advanced rectal 
cancer could stratify patients into subsets at 
very high risk or low risk of recurrence. 
 
The strong prognostic impact of 
postoperative circulating tumor DNA status 
appears to be independent of other known 
pathological risk factors. 
Tarazona et 
al

Detection of ctDNA after surgery and in serial 
plasma samples during follow-up were 
associated with poorer disease-free survival 
(DFS) [hazard ratio (HR), 17.56; log-rank P = 
0.0014 and HR, 11.33; log-rank P = 0.0001, 
respectively]. 
 
In patients treated with adjuvant 
chemotherapy, presence of ctDNA after 
therapy was associated with early relapse (HR 
10.02; log-rank P < 0.0001).  
 
Detection of ctDNA at follow-up preceded 
radiological recurrence with a median lead 
time of 11.5 months. 
 
ctDNA was the only significantly independent 
predictor of DFS in multivariable analysis. 
 
Plasma postoperative ctDNA detected MRD 
and identified patients at high risk of relapse 
in localized CC. 
 
The data showed the presence of 
postoperative ctDNA establishes a stronger 
prognostic marker than conventional 
pathological factors such as stage.  
 
The findings are consistent with previous 
studies, which have already shown that 
ctDNA after surgery can be a biomarker of 
MRD and therefore a prognostic factor for 
recurrence in patients with colorectal cancer. 
Tie et al

Patients with detectable postoperative ctDNA 
experienced a significantly lower RFS (HR 6.3; 
95% CI 2.58 to 15.2; P < 0.001) and overall 
survival (HR 4.2; 95% CI 1.5 to 11.8; P < 0.001) 
compared to patients with undetectable 
ctDNA 
 
All patients with detectable postoperative 
ctDNA who failed to clear their ctDNA 
following adjuvant chemotherapy experienced 
recurrence, while 67% of patients whose 
ctDNA became undetectable after 
chemotherapy remained disease-free 
 
End   -of-treatment (surgery +/− adjuvant 
chemotherapy) ctDNA detection was 
associated with a 5-year RFS of 0% compared 
to 75.6% for patients with an undetectable 
end  -of-treatment ctDNA (HR 14.9; 95% CI 4.94 
to 44.7; P < 0.001). 
We confirmed the prognostic impact of post-
surgery and post-treatment ctDNA in 
patients with resected CRLM.  
 
The potential utility of serial ctDNA analysis 
during adjuvant chemotherapy as an early 
marker of treatment efficacy was also 
demonstrated 
 
ctDNA detection after surgery or after 
completion of adjuvant chemotherapy is 
associated with a very high risk of recurrence 
and death in patients with resectable CRLM 
 
ctDNA dynamics before and after adjuvant 
chemotherapy reflected adjuvant treatment 
efficacy.

Postsurgical, MRD positivity was observed in 
54.4% (61 of 112) of patients, of which 96.7% (59 
of 61) progressed at the time of data cutoff 
(hazard ratio [HR]: 5.8; 95% CI, 3.5 to 9.7; P <

MRD-positive status was also associated with 
an inferior overall survival: HR: 16.0; 95% CI, 3.9

At the time of analyses, 96% (49 of 51) of 
patients were alive in the MRD-negative arm 
compared with 52.4% (32 of 61) in the MRD-
positive arm. 
 
Patients who did not receive systemic therapy 
and were MRD-negative in the combined 
ctDNA analysis at two time points had an 
overall survival of 100%. 
 
In the multivariate analysis, ctDNA-based 
MRD status was the most significant 
prognostic factor associated with disease-free 
survival (HR: 5.78; 95% CI, 3.34 to 10.0; P < .001). 
This study confirms that in mCRC undergoing 
resection of metastases, postoperative MRD 
analysis is a strong prognostic biomarker 
 
The present work supports the continuous 
expansion of the number of clinical studies in 
patients with mCRC using personalized 
ctDNA-based MRD analysis and provides 
direct evidence of the predictive and 
prognostic value of ctDNA, which could help 
clinicians and researchers with real numbers 
to design their clinical studies and support 
therapeutic decisions in the adjuvant setting

Surveillance with CEA measurement appeared 
to perform poorly in detecting a first 
recurrence, with a sensitivity of only 20.0% 
(95% CI, 5.3%-48.6%).  
 
Circulating tumor DNA did not appear to 
perform numerically better than imaging, with 
sensitivities of 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 
60.0% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), (P > .99), 
respectively.  
 
The specificity was the highest for ctDNA at 
100% (95% CI, 87.0%-100%) 
 
When combining imaging and measurement 
of CEA levels, as recommended by NCCN 
guidelines, the combination modality had a 
numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in 
identifying a recurrence (sensitivity, 73.3% 
[95% CI, 44.8%-91.1%]; P = .55) and performed 
well on both the PPV (73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-
91.1%] vs 100% [95% CI, 59.8%-100%]) and 
NPV (87.9% [95% CI, 70.9%- 96.0%] vs 82.5% 
[95% CI, 66.6%-92.1%]). 
 
Statistical analysis showed that the sensitivity 
of CEA surveillance was significantly worse 
than that of combined imaging and 
measurement of CEA levels (20.0% [95% CI, 
5.3%-48.6%]; P = .01). 
 
No significant difference was noted among 
ctDNA (median, 14.3 months), imaging 
(median, 15.0 months), or imaging plus 
measurement of CEA levels (median, 15.0 
The findings of this prospective cohort study 
suggest that ctDNA assay may not provide 
definitive advantages as a surveillance 
strategy compared with standard imaging 
combined with measurement of CEA levels 
when performed per NCCN guidelines. 
However, a positive ctDNA finding without 
doubt indicates an almost definitive risk of 
relapse.

 Circulating tumor DNA was detectable in 20 of 
96 (21%) postsurgical samples and was 
associated with inferior recurrence-free 
survival (hazard ratio [HR], 3.8; 95% CI, 2.4-
21.0; P < .001) 
 
In this multicenter cohort study of 96 patients 
with stage III colon cancer, a significant 
difference in 3-year recurrence-free interval 
was observed in patients with detectable vs 
undetectable levels of circulating tumor DNA 
after surgery (47% vs 76%)  
 
The estimated 3-year RFI was 30% when 
ctDNA was detectable after chemotherapy 
and 77% when ctDNA was undetectable (HR, 
6.8; 95% CI, 11.0-157.0; P < .001) 
 
Postsurgical ctDNA status remained 
independently associated with RFI after 
adjusting for known clinicopathologic risk 
factors (HR, 7.5; 95% CI, 3.5-16.1; P < .001). 
Results suggest that ctDNA analysis after 
surgery is a promising prognostic marker in 
stage III colon cancer. Post chemotherapy 
ctDNA analysis may define a patient subset 
that remains at high risk of recurrence 
despite completing standard adjuvant 
treatment.

455 patients underwent randomization, 302 
were assigned to ctDNA-guided management 
and 153 to standard of care management 
 
A lower percentage of patients in the ctDNA-
guided group than in the standard-
management group received adjuvant 
chemotherapy (15% vs. 28%; relative risk, 1.82; 
95% confidence interval [CI], 1.25 to 2.65). 
 
In the evaluation of 2-year recurrence-free 
survival, ctDNA-guided management was 
noninferior to standard management (93.5% 
and 92.4%, respectively; absolute difference, 1.1 
percentage points; 95% CI, −4.1 to 6.2 
[noninferiority margin, −8.5 percentage 
points]). 
 
Three-year recurrence-free survival was 86.4% 
among ctDNA-positive patients who received 
adjuvant chemotherapy and 92.5% among 
ctDNA-negative patients who did not. 
 
Among ctDNA-negative patients, 3-year 
recurrence-free survival was higher among 
patients with clinical low-risk cancers than 
among those with high-risk cancers (96.7% vs. 
85.1%; hazard ratio, 3.04; 95% CI, 1.26 to 7.34) 
 
3-year recurrence-free survival was higher 
among patients with T3 tumors than among 
those with T4 tumors (94.2% vs. 81.3%; hazard 
ratio, 2.60; 95% CI, 1.01 to 6.71) 
 
In this trial, we found that a ctDNA-guided 
approach reduced the number of patients 
who received adjuvant therapy and did not 
alter the risk of recurrence. 
 
ctDNA positive patients appeared to derive 
considerable benefit from adjuvant 
treatment, given the low percentage of 
patients with recurrence in this trial as 
compared with previously reported high 
recurrence rates in this subgroup of patients 
when no adjuvant chemotherapy was 
administered 
 
The study confirmed the very low risk of 
recurrence in untreated ctDNA-negative 
patient 
 
Most notable was the 3-year recurrence-free 
survival of 96.7% among patients with low-
risk disease, indicating that adjuvant therapy 
should not be considered for ctDNA negative 
patients who are at clinicopathological low 
risk. This is an important observation, 
because in routine clinical practice adjuvant 
chemotherapy is still administered to some 
patients at low risk (11% in our standard-
management group), particularly younger 
patients 
 
The results of this trial suggest that a survival 
benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy may be 
obtained in a well-defined subgroup of 
patients with stage II colon cancer —

GALAXY enrolled 1,564 patients, of whom 1,040 
(the “outcome cohort”) were included in the 
current analysis. 
 
Patients who tested positive for ctDNA 4 
weeks after surgery had an 11- to 13-times 
increased risk for recurrence. 
 
The assay’s sensitivity for disease recurrence 
was calculated at 63.6% for the analysis of 
patients with stage I to IV disease and 67.6% 
for those with stage II to III disease. 
 
The multivariate analysis showed the risk of 
recurrence for patients with stage II to III 
tumors was highly correlated with ctDNA 
positivity at 4 weeks after surgery (hazard 
ratio [HR] = 15.3; P < .001).  
 
Patients with baseline ctDNA positivity who 
remained positive over the course of 
treatment had an almost 16-fold increased 
risk of disease recurrence 
 
Patients who did not clear their ctDNA 
between 4- and 12-weeks during adjuvant 
chemotherapy had significantly worse 
outcomes relative to those who cleared their 
ctDNA—i.e., “positive to positive” (58.3%) vs 
“positive to negative” (100%)—exhibiting a 
15.8  -fold increased risk.  
 
The disease-free survival rate for ctDNA-
negative patients that remained negative was 
98% and for those who turned positive 62.5%. 
 
For patients with high-risk stage II, stage III, 
and stage IV disease, adjuvant chemotherapy 
yielded a benefit among patients who tested 
positive for ctDNA 4 weeks after surgery, with 
hazard ratios of 9.4 (P = .04), 8.8 (P < .001), and 
2.4 (P = .02), respectively.  
 
Patients with high-risk stage II to III disease 
who tested negative for ctDNA at 4 weeks, on 
the other hand, had excellent outcomes, 
whether or not they received chemotherapy, 
with a disease-free survival of approximately 
95% at 12 months. 
The study shows that stratifying post-
surgical treatment decisions using the ctDNA 
assay can identify patients likely to benefit 
from ACT across all stages of disease, 
including pStage II.

Section Summary: Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing with Signatera in Individuals 
with Colorectal Cancer 
For individuals with colorectal cancer (CRC) who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing with 
Signatera to guide treatment decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 3 
noncomparative studies (N = 410) and 1 retrospective comparative study (N = 48).  
 
Nonrandomized studies have reported an association between ctDNA results measured at diagnosis, 
following surgery, during adjuvant therapy, and during surveillance after curative treatment and 
prognosis, but these studies are limited by a lack of comparison to tests used for the same purpose, 
imprecise estimates due to small sample sizes, and clinical heterogeneity of study populations. No 
stu  dy reported management changes made in response to ctDNA test results. A retrospective 
observational study found no advantage to surveillance with Signatera compared to standard 
surveillance conducted according to NCCN guidelines (p>.99 for sensitivity and specificity compared

to imaging). There is no direct evidence that the use of the test improves health outcomes, and 
indirect evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about clinical validity. 
 
Breast Cancer 
The purpose of tumor-informed ctDNA testing in individuals with breast cancer is to predict disease 
course (e.g., aggressiveness, risk of recurrence, death) and inform treatment decisions, and to monitor 
for recurrence following curative treatment. 
 
The question addressed in this evidence review is: Does tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA 
testing improve the net health outcome in individuals with breast cancer? 
 
The following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review. 
 
Populations 
The population of interest is individuals with breast cancer, or those who have been treated for 
breast cancer and are being monitored for recurrence. 
 
Interventions 
The test being considered is circulating tumor DNA testing with Signatera: 
• At diagnosis to inform decisions about neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
• After surgery to inform decisions about adjuvant treatment. 
• Following curative treatment, to monitor for recurrence. 
 
Comparators 
• Decisions about neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy are based on clinicopathological 
risk factors. 
• Guidelines for disease surveillance following breast cancer treatment recommend regular 
imaging and physical examinations, and additional testing upon presentation of symptoms. 
 
Outcomes 
The general outcomes of interest are disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, and change 
in disease status. Specific outcomes of interest are recurrence risk, RFS, and overall survival at follow-
up. 
 
The specific outcomes of interest depend on the proposed purpose of testing in individuals with 
breast cancer. 
• If used for risk stratification to 
rule  -out individuals for neoadjuvant chemotherapy at 
diagnosis or adjuvant treatment following surgery, the performance characteristics of most 
interest are negative predictive value and sensitivity. 
• If used for risk stratification to to  
rule  -in individuals for neoadjuvant chemotherapy at 
diagnosis or adjuvant treatment following surgery, the performance characteristics of most 
interest are positive predictive value and specificity. 
 
If used for disease surveillance following primary treatment, beneficial outcomes of a true positive 
test would be earlier detection of metastasis and initiation of treatment. Harmful outcomes of a false 
positive test would be undergoing unnecessary or incorrect treatment, and experiencing adverse 
effects of such treatment. See also Evidence review 2.04.36 for additional discussion of outcomes in 
breast cancer risk assessment studies. 
 
Study Selection Criteria 
For the evaluation of clinical validity of tumor informed ctDNA testing  , studies that meet the 
following eligibility criteria were considered: 
• Reported on the accuracy of the marketed version of the technology 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management 
Page 25 of 50 
 
 
Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
• Included a suitable reference standard 
• Individual/sample clinical characteristics were described 
• Individual/sample selection criteria were described. 
 
Nonrandomized Trials 
Coombes et al (2019) evaluated Signatera for disease surveillance in 49 individuals who had received 
surgery and adjuvant therapy for stage I to III breast cancer of various subtypes.
6,
 Signatera detected 
ctDNA in 16 of 18 individuals who subsequently relapsed, and the presence of ctDNA test was 
associated with poorer prognosis (Table 7). 
 
Magbanua et al (2021) evaluated ctDNA clearance as a predictor of response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy (NAC) in 84 individuals with nonmetastatic breast cancer who were enrolled in the I-
SPY2 trial.
7,
 In the population as a whole, ctDNA positivity decreased during the course of NAC, from 
73% before treatment (T0), to 35% at 3 weeks (T1), to 14% at the inter-regimen time point (T2), and 
down to 9% after NAC (T3). Hazard ratios for recurrence at each of these timepoints are shown in 
Table 7 and indicate that positive predictive value increased over time. 
 
Study limitations are shown in Tables 8 and 9. Major limitations of both studies include a lack of 
comparison to standard methods of monitoring, and heterogeneity in the study populations. 
 
Coombes et al (2019), in a longitudinal study6 in breast cancer patients found that plasma ctDNA 
was detected before clinical or radiologic relapse in 16 of 18 relapsed patients; moreover, ctDNA 
predicted metastatic relapse with a lead time of up to 2 years.

Section Summary: Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Individuals with Breast 
Cancer 
For individuals with breast cancer who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide treatment 
decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 2 noncomparative studies (N = 133). One 
study evaluated Signatera testing for disease surveillance following primary treatment, and 1 
reported the association of test results at different timepoints with response to neoadjuvant 
chemotherapy. Although the studies found an association of test results with prognosis, the studies 
are limited by a lack of comparison to tests used for the same purpose, imprecise estimates due to 
small sample sizes, and clinical heterogeneity of study populations. No study reported management

changes made in response to ctDNA test results. There is no direct evidence that the use of the test 
improves health outcomes, and indirect evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about clinical 
validity. 
 
Bladder Cancer 
Clinical Context and Test Purpose 
The purpose of testing in individuals with bladder cancer is to predict disease course to inform 
treatment decisions and to monitor for recurrence following curative treatment. 
 
The question addressed in this evidence review is: Does tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA 
testing improve the net health outcome in individuals with bladder cancer? 
The following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review. 
 
Populations 
The relevant population of interest is individuals with bladder cancer, or those who have been treated 
for bladder cancer and are being monitored for recurrence. 
 
Interventions 
The test being considered is circulating tumor DNA testing: 
• At diagnosis, to identify individuals at low risk of recurrence after cystectomy who may be 
eligible for cystectomy without neoadjuvant chemotherapy. 
• After chemotherapy before cystectomy, to determine treatment response and inform 
treatment decisions (e.g., additional cycles of chemotherapy or other therapeutic strategies). 
• During disease surveillance after cystectomy, to identify metastatic relapse after cystectomy 
at an early time point, and aid in the selection of individuals who may benefit from 
early/adjuvant treatment. For individuals with bladder cancer who are being evaluated for 
adjuvant chemotherapy, given that the test will be used to 
rule  -in individuals for adjuvant 
chemotherapy, the performance characteristics of most interest are positive predictive value 
and specificity. 
 
Comparators 
• Urine testing, cystoscopy, and radiographic imaging are used for disease monitoring in 
individuals with bladder cancer. 
• Detection of relapse and monitoring of response to treatment in the metastatic setting is 
performed by standard computed tomography scan. 
 
Outcomes 
The general outcomes of interest are disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, and change 
in disease status. Specific outcomes of interest are recurrence risk, RFS, and overall survival at follow-
up. 
 
If used to 
rule in individuals with bladder cancer who would be likely to benefit from adjuvant 
chemotherapy, the performance characteristics of most interest are positive predictive value and 
specificity. 
 
If used to 
rule out patients with bladder cancer who could forego adjuvant chemotherapy, the 
performance characteristics of most interest are negative predictive value and sensitivity. However, 
since the test would be used to select individuals who would not receive category 1 recommended 
treatment, direct evidence of improvement in outcomes is required. 
 
Study Selection Criteria 
For the evaluation of clinical validity of these test   s, studies that meet the following eligibility criteria 
were considered: 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management 
Page 29 of 50 
 
 
Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
• Reported on the accuracy of the marketed version of the technology 
• Included a suitable reference standard 
• Individual/sample clinical characteristics were described 
• Individual/sample selection criteria were described. 
 
Nonrandomized Trials 
Two nonrandomized studies have reported an association between Signatera testing and prognosis 
in bladder cancer (Tables 10 and 11). 
 
Christensen et al (2019) assessed the association of ctDNA with prognosis in 68 individuals with 
localized advanced bladder cancer.
8, 
 
Powles et al (2021) reported the association of a positive Signatera test to treatment response in 581 
individuals who had undergone surgery for urothelial cancer and were enrolled in a RCT of 
atezolizumab versus observation.
9,
 Study participants who were positive for ctDNA had improved 
disease-free survival and overall survival in the atezolizumab arm versus the observation arm 
(disease-free survival hazard ratio = 0.58 [95% CI, 0.43–0.79]; p=.0024 and overall survival hazard 
ratio = 0.59 [95% CI, 0.41–0.86]). No difference in disease-free survival or overall survival between 
treatment arms was noted for patients who were negative for ctDNA. 
 
Christensen et al (2019) A prospective study evaluating ctDNA before and after surgery and during 
chemotherapy in patients with locally advanced bladder cancer found that the dynamics of ctDNA 
during treatment is a good predictor of outcome and a better predictor of treatment efficacy than 
pathologic downstaging. Moreover, in this study, patients without clearance of ctDNA had a 
response rate of 0%8. 
 
The major limitation of these studies was lack of comparison to other tests used for the same 
purpose (Tables 12 and 13).

Section Summary: Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Individuals with Bladder 
Cancer 
For individuals with bladder cancer who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide treatment 
decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 1 uncontrolled prospective cohort study 
(N = 68) and 1 retrospective subgroup analysis from a RCT (N = 581). The prospective study reported 
an association between Signatera test results at diagnosis, during chemotherapy treatment, and 
during surveillance following cystectomy to prognosis. The retrospective analysis reported an 
association between test results and response to atezolizumab treatment. Study limitations, including 
a lack of comparison to tests used for the same purpose preclude drawing conclusions about clinical 
validity and usefulness. No study reported management changes made in response to ctDNA test 
results. There is no direct evidence that the use of the test improves health outcomes, and indirect 
evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about clinical validity. 
 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC) 
Clinical Context and Test Purpose 
The purpose of testing in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is to predict disease 
course to inform treatment decisions and to monitor for recurrence following surgical resection. 
 
The question addressed in this evidence review is: Does tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA 
testing improve the net health outcome in individuals with NSCLC? 
 
The following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review. 
 
Populations 
The relevant population of interest is individuals with NSCLC, or those who have been treated for 
NSCLC and are being monitored for recurrence.    
 
Interventions 
The test being considered is tumor informed circulating tumor DNA testing following surgical 
resection, to identify metastatic relapse at an early time point, and aid in the selection of individuals 
who may benefit from early/adjuvant treatment. 
 
Adjuvant platinum-based chemotherapy is not the standard of care following surgery for NSCLC; 
treatment improves cure rates after surgery in only 5% of patients, and 20% of patients receiving 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management 
Page 32 of 50 
 
 
Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
chemotherapy experience acute toxicities.    Testing is proposed to select patients who are very likely to 
relapse post-operatively and who might benefit from adjuvant treatment. 
 
Comparators 
Radiographic imaging is used for disease monitoring in individuals with NSCLC. Detection of relapse 
and monitoring of response to treatment in the metastatic setting is performed by standard 
computed tomography scan, with frequency and type of imaging depending on primary treatment 
and stage. For patients with stage I-II NSCLC following completion of definitive therapy, NCCN 
guidelines recommend history and physical and chest CT every 6 months for 2 to 3 years, then 
annually. For patients with primary treatment that included radiotherapy, surveillance is 
recommended every 3 to 6 months for 3 years, and every 6 months for 2 years, then annually. 
Treatment options following recurrence include resection and/or systemic therapy. 
 
Outcomes 
The general outcomes of interest are disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, and change 
in disease status. Specific outcomes of interest are recurrence risk, RFS, and overall survival at follow-
up. 
 
Beneficial outcomes of a true positive test would be an individual undergoing potentially beneficial 
additional treatment such as chemotherapy at an earlier time point than if a relapse were identified 
clinically. 
 
Harmful outcomes of a false positive test would be undergoing unnecessary or incorrect treatment, 
and experiencing adverse effects of such treatment. 
 
Nonrandomized Trial 
The evidence for the use of ctDNA testing to detect relapse in NSCLC following surgery is limited to a 
subgroup analysis of 24 individuals enrolled in TRACERx, a longitudinal cohort study of tumor 
sampling and genetic analysis in individuals with NSCLC.
10,
 Of 14 individuals with confirmed relapse, 
13 (93%) had a positive ctDNA test (defined as at least 2 single-nucleotide variants detected). Of 10 
individuals with no relapse after a median follow up of 775 days, (range 688 to 945 days), 1 had a 
positive ctDNA test (10%). 
 
Also, the TRAcking non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) Evolution through therapy (TRACERx), is a 
prospective study phylogenetically profiling and monitoring (from diagnosis to death) the clonal 
evolution of tumors in 100 NSCLC patients. The median interval between ctDNA detection and 
detection of relapse by imaging was 70 days (range 10 to 346 days); in some of these cases, lead 
times of more than 6 months were observed.
10
 In some cases, further subclonal analysis revealed 
targetable mutations and amplification events implicated in driving the relapse, thereby also 
impacting the therapeutic options available to a given patient.

Study limitations are shown in Tables 15 and 16. Major limitations include no comparison to standard 
surveillance methods and imprecise estimates due to the small sample size. Additionally, the 
commercially available Signatera has been updated since this publication.

Section Summary: Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Individuals with Non-Small 
Cell Lung Cancer 
For individuals with NSCLC who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing with Signatera to guide 
treatment decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 1 subgroup analysis of 
participants enrolled in a prospective observational study (N = 24). Of 14 individuals with confirmed 
relapse, 13 (93%) had a positive ctDNA test (defined as at least 2 single-nucleotide variants detected). 
Of 10 individuals with no relapse after a median follow up of 775 days, (range 688 to 945 days), 1 had 
a positive ctDNA test (10%). This study’s small sample size and lack of a comparator preclude 
drawing conclusions about clinical validity. There is no direct evidence that the use of the test 
improves health outcomes, and indirect evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions about clinical 
validity. 
 
Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Individuals with Esophageal Cancer 
Clinical Context and Test Purpose 
The purpose of testing in individuals with esophageal cancer is to detect minimal residual disease 
following surgical resection and to monitor for disease recurrence. 
 
The question addressed in this evidence review is: Does tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA 
testing improve the net health outcome in individuals with esophageal cancer? 
 
The following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review. 
 
Populations 
The relevant population of interest is individuals with esophageal cancer who have undergone 
surgical resection. 
 
Interventions 
The test being considered is circulating tumor DNA testing with Signatera: 
• Following surgical resection, to detect minimal residual disease and aid in the selection of 
individuals who may benefit from early/adjuvant treatment. 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management 
Page 35 of 50 
 
 
Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
• For disease monitoring after curative treatment, to identify metastatic relapse at an early 
time point, and aid in the selection of individuals who may benefit from early/adjuvant 
treatment. 
 
Comparators 
Recommendations on surveillance and monitoring following esophageal cancer treatment include 
per  iodic upper endoscopy, laboratory tests, and imaging as indicated. Specific recommendations 
depend on tumor classification. 
 
Outcomes 
The general outcomes of interest are disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, and change 
in disease status. Specific outcomes of interest are recurrence risk, RFS, and overall survival at follow-
up. 
 
Beneficial outcomes of a true positive test would be an individual undergoing potentially beneficial 
additional treatment at an earlier time point than if a relapse were identified clinically. 
 
Harmful outcomes of a false positive test would be undergoing unnecessary or incorrect treatment 
and experiencing adverse effects of such treatment. 
 
Study Selection Criteria 
For the evaluation of clinical validity of the Signatera test, studies that meet the following eligibility 
criteria were considered: 
• Reported on the accuracy of the marketed version of the technology 
• Included a suitable reference standard 
• Individual/sample clinical characteristics were described 
• Individual/sample selection criteria were described. 
 
Nonrandomized Trial 
One noncomparative retrospective study reported the association of Signatera testing measured 
before and after surgery with relapse and recurrence in 17 individuals with esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (Tables 17 and 18). Patients who were ctDNA-positive before surgery had 
significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) (p<.042), with a median DFS of 32.0 months vs. 63.0 
months in ctDNA-negative preoperative patients. This study was limited by the very small number 
sample size, and its retrospective design (Tables 19 and 20).

Section Summary: Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Individuals with 
Esophageal Cancer 
For individuals with esophageal cancer who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide 
treatment decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 1 noncomparative, 
retrospective study (N = 17). Patients who were ctDNA-positive before surgery had significantly 
poorer disease-free    survival (DFS) (p<.042), with a median DFS of 32.0 months versus 63.0 months in 
ctDNA-negative preoperative patients. This study was limited by its small number sample size and 
retrospective design. There is no direct evidence that the use of the test improves health outcomes. 
Due to the study's limitations and lack of additional supporting studies, the evidence is not sufficient 
to draw conclusions on clinical validity. Additionally, the management pathway for Signatera testing 
in esophageal cancer has not been clearly defined. 
 
Immunotherapy for Solid Tumors 
Clinical Context and Test Purpose 
The purpose of testing in individuals with solid tumors who have received immunotherapy is to 
monitor treatment response and inform subsequent treatment decisions. Tumor-informed ctDNA 
testing is proposed as a method to stratify patients according to their likelihood of response to 
immunotherapy, to guide treatment decisions. 
 
The question addressed in this evidence review is: Does tumor-informed circulating tumor DNA 
testing improve the net health outcome in individuals with solid tumors who have received 
immunotherapy? 
 
The following PICO was used to select literature to inform this review. 
 
Populations 
The relevant population of interest is individuals with solid tumors who have received immune 
checkpoint therapy. 
 
Interventions 
The test being considered is circulating tumor DNA testing with Signatera. 
 
Comparators 
For individuals with solid tumors receiving immunotherapy, treatment response is monitored by 
repeated radiographic evaluation of the tumor. 
 
Outcomes 
The general outcomes of interest are disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, and change 
in disease status. Specific outcomes of interest are recurrence risk, RFS, and overall survival at follow-
up. 
 
If the test is used to 
rule  -in individuals with solid tumors who are likely to respond to immunotherapy, 
the performance characteristics of most interest are positive predictive value and specificity. 
 
If the test is used to 
rule  -out   individuals with solid tumors who are unlikely to respond to 
immunotherapy, the performance characteristics of most interest are negative predictive value and 
sensitivity. 
 
Study Selection Criteria 
For the evaluation of clinical validity of the Signatera test, studies that meet the following eligibility 
criteria were considered: 
• Reported on the accuracy of the marketed version of the technology 
• Included a suitable reference standard 
• Individual/sample clinical characteristics were described 

BSC2.18 Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing for Cancer Management 
Page 38 of 50 
 
 
Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
• Individual/sample selection criteria were described. 
 
Nonrandomized Trial 
Bratman et al (2020) evaluated Signatera to predict treatment response in 106 individuals receiving 
pembrolizumab for solid tumors, including squamous cell cancer of head and neck, triple negative 
breast cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, malignant melanoma, and mixed solid tumors 
(Tables 21 and 22).
12,   
 
Lower-than-median ctDNA levels at baseline were associated with improved overall survival 
(adjusted hazard ratio [HR] 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.83) and progression free survival (adjusted HR 0.54, 
95% CI 0.34 to 0.85). Among participants with at least 2 ctDNA measurements, any rise in ctDNA 
levels during surveillance above baseline was associated with rapid disease progression and poor 
survival (median overall survival 13.7 months), whereas among 12 patients whose ctDNA cleared 
during treatment, overall survival was 100% at a median follow up of 25.4 months (range 10.8 to 29.5 
months) following the first clearance. 
 
Study limitations are shown in Tables 23 and 24. This single-center study is limited by its small sample 
size and variability in results across different tumor types. The study did not include a comparison of 
monitoring with ctDNA to standard methods of monitoring response such as repeat imaging.

Section Summary: Tumor-Informed Circulating Tumor DNA Testing in Individuals with Solid 
Tumors Receiving Immunotherapy 
For individuals with solid tumors who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to monitor response to 
immunotherapy, the evidence includes a subgroup analysis of individuals enrolled in a 
nonrandomized trial of pembrolizumab (N = 106). The subgroup analysis evaluated testing to monitor 
response to immunotherapy in individuals with advanced solid tumors who were enrolled in a Phase 
II clinical trial of pembrolizumab. Lower-than-median ctDNA levels at baseline were associated with 
improved overall survival (adjusted HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.83) and progression free survival 
(adjusted HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85). The study was limited by a small sample size, variability in 
results across different tumor types, and lack of a comparison to standard methods of monitoring 
response to treatment. There is limited direct evidence that the use of the test improves health 
outcomes. The management pathway for tumor-informed ctDNA testing for monitoring response to 
immunotherapy needs further definition.

Overall Summary of Evidence 
For individuals with CRC who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide treatment decisions 
and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 3 noncomparative studies (N = 410) and 1 
retrospective comparative study (N = 48). Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific 
survival, test validity, other test performance measures, change in disease status, morbid events, 
functional outcomes, health status measures, quality of life, and treatment-related mortality. 
Nonrandomized studies have reported an association between ctDNA results measured at diagnosis, 
following surgery, during adjuvant therapy, and during surveillance after curative treatment and 
prognosis, but these studies are limited by a lack of comparison to tests used for the same purpose, 
imprecise estimates due to small sample sizes, and clinical heterogeneity of study populations. No 
study reported management changes made in response to ctDNA test results. A retrospective 
observational study found no clear advantage to surveillance compared to standard surveillance 
conducted according to NCCN guidelines (p>.99 for sensitivity and specificity compared to imaging), 
however, direct use comparison was not done in the study. There is limited direct evidence that the 
use of the test improves health outcomes. However, indirect evidence supports the use of this 
technology.  
 
For individuals with breast cancer who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide treatment 
decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 2 noncomparative studies (N = 133). 
Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific survival, test validity, other test performance 
measures, change in disease status, morbid events, functional outcomes, health status measures, 
quality of life, and treatment-related mortality. One study evaluated Signatera testing for disease 
surveillance following primary treatment, and 1 reported the association of test results at different 
timepoints with response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Although the studies found an association 
of test results with prognosis, the studies are limited by a lack of comparison to tests used for the 
same purpose, and imprecise estimates due to small sample sizes. No study reported management 
changes made in response to ctDNA test results, but that was not an outcome measure. There is 
limited direct evidence that the use of the test improves health outcomes, however, indirect evidence 
supports the use of this technology.  
 
For individuals with bladder cancer who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing with Signatera to 
guide treatment decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 1 uncontrolled 
prospective cohort study (N = 68) and 1 retrospective subgroup analysis from a RCT (N = 581). 
Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific survival, test validity, other test performance 
measure, change in disease status, morbid events, functional outcomes, health status measures, 
quality of life, and treatment-related mortality. The prospective study reported an association 
between test results at diagnosis, during chemotherapy treatment, and during surveillance following 
cystectomy to prognosis. The retrospective analysis reported an association between test results and 
response to atezolizumab treatment. Study limitations, including a lack of comparison to tests used 
for the same purpose limit drawing definitive conclusions about clinical validity and usefulness. No 
study reported management changes made in response to ctDNA test results. There is limited direct 
evidence that the use of the test improves health outcomes, however, indirect evidence supports the 
use of this technology.  
 
For individuals with NSCLC who receive tumor-inf  ormed ctDNA testing to guide treatment decisions 
and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 1 subgroup analysis of participants enrolled in a 
prospective observational study (N = 24). Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific 
survival, test validity, other test performance measures, change in disease status, morbid events, 
functional outcomes, health status measures, quality of life, and treatment-related mortality. Of 14 
individuals with confirmed relapse, 13 (93%) had a positive ctDNA test (defined as at least 2 single-
nucleotide variants detected). Of 10 individuals with no relapse after a median follow up of 775 days, 
(range 688 to 945 days), 1 had a positive ctDNA test (10%). This study’s small sample size and lack of a 
comparator limit drawing definitive conclusions about clinical validity. There is limited direct evidence

that the use of the test improves health outcomes, however, indirect evidence supports the use of this 
technology.  
 
For individuals with esophageal cancer who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to guide 
treatment decisions and monitor for recurrence, the evidence includes 1 noncomparative, 
retrospective study (N = 17). Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific survival, test 
validity, other test performance measure, change in disease status, morbid events, functional 
outcomes, health status measures, quality of life, and treatment-related mortality. Patients who were 
ctDNA-positive before surgery had significantly poorer disease-free survival (DFS) (p<.042), with a 
median DFS of 32.0 months versus 63.0 months in ctDNA-negative preoperative patients. This study 
was limited by its small number sample size and retrospective design. There is limited direct evidence 
that the use of the test improves health outcomes. However, indirect evidence supports the use of this 
technology.  
 
For individuals with solid tumors who receive tumor-informed ctDNA testing to monitor response to 
immunotherapy, the evidence includes a subgroup analysis of individuals enrolled in a 
nonrandomized trial of pembrolizumab (N = 106). Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-
specific survival, test validity, other test performance measures, change in disease status, morbid 
events, functional outcomes, health status measures, quality of life, and treatment-related mortality. 
The subgroup analysis evaluated testing to monitor response to immunotherapy in individuals with 
advanced solid tumors who were enrolled in a Phase II clinical trial of pembrolizumab. Lower-than-
median ctDNA levels at baseline were associated with improved overall survival (adjusted [HR 0.49, 
95% CI 0.29 to 0.83) and progression free survival (adjusted HR 0.54, 95% CI 0.34 to 0.85). The study 
was limited by a small sample size, variability in results across different tumor types, and lack of a 
comparison to standard methods of monitoring response to treatment. There is limited direct 
evidence that the use of the test improves health outcomes. However, indirect evidence supports the 
use of this technology. 
 
Supplemental Information 
The purpose of the following information is to provide reference material. Inclusion does not imply

Practice Guidelines and Position Statements 
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in ‘Supplemental Information' if they 
were issued by, or jointly by, a US professional society, an international society with US 
representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be given to 
guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include strength of evidence ratings, and include 
a description of management of conflict of interest. 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines do not yet specifically address tumor-informed 
ctDNA testing for any of the cancer types included in this review. The guidelines on colon cancer 
state: "The panel believes that there are insufficient data to recommend the use of multigene assays, 
Immunoscore or post-surgical ctDNA to estimate risk of recurrence or determine adjuvant therapy."

“MRD testing for cancer is rapidly becoming a sensitive and specific method for monitoring the 
relative amounts of tumor-derived genetic material circulating in the blood of cancer patients. These 
tests leverage new genomic technologies that allow detection of extremely dilute tumor material, 
yielding an extremely sensitive method for determining the continued presence of tumor material or, 
by serially testing the same individual, tracking the relative increase or decrease of tumor material 
being deposited in the blood. Although it is a relatively new application of novel genomic 
technologies, it has rapidly demonstrated its ability to impact patient care in several ways in cancer 
diagnosis and treatment. MRD testing can be used to: 
• diagnose cancer progression, recurrence, or relapse before there is clinical, biological, or 
radiographical evidence of progression, recurrence or relapse 
• detect tumor response to therapy by measuring the proportional changes in the amount of 
available tumor DNA 
 
Both above uses may enable physicians to better assign risk stratification, deploy alternate 
treatment strategies, or preclude the use of unnecessary adjuvant therapies.”

Definitions of Decision Determinations 
 
Medically Necessary: Services that are Medically Necessary include only those which have been 
established as safe and effective, are furnished under generally accepted professional standards to 
treat illness, injury or medical condition, and which, as determined by Blue Shield, are: (a) consistent 
with Blue Shield medical policy; (b) consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis; (c) not furnished 
primarily for the convenience of the patient, the attending Physician or other provider; (d) furnished 
at the most appropriate level which can be provided safely and effectively to the patient; and (e) not 
more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent 
therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the Member’s illness, injury, or 
disease. 
 
Investigational/Experimental:  A treatment, procedure, or drug is investigational when it has not 
been recognized as safe and effective for use in treating the particular condition in accordance with 
generally accepted professional medical standards. This includes services where approval by the 
federal or state governmental is required prior to use, but has not yet been granted.   
 
Split Evaluation:  Blue Shield of California/Blue Shield of California Life & Health Insurance Company 
(Blue Shield) policy review can result in a split evaluation, where a treatment, procedure, or drug will 
be considered to be investigational for certain indications or conditions, but will be deemed safe and 
effective for other indications or conditions, and therefore potentially medically necessary in those 
instances. 
 
Prior Authorization Requirements and Feedback (as applicable to your plan) 
 
Within five days before the actual date of service, the provider must confirm with Blue Shield that the 
member's health plan coverage is still in effect. Blue Shield reserves the right to revoke an 
authorization prior to services being rendered based on cancellation of the member's eligibility. Final 
determination of benefits will be made after review of the claim for limitations or exclusions.  
 
Questions regarding the applicability of this policy should be directed to the Prior Authorization 
Department at (800) 541-6652, or the Transplant Case Management Department at (800) 637-2066 
ext.    3507708 or visit the provider portal at www.blueshieldca.com/provider
. 
 
We are interested in receiving feedback relative to developing, adopting, and reviewing criteria for 
medical policy. Any licensed practitioner who is contracted with Blue Shield of California or Blue 
Shield of California Promise Health Plan is welcome to provide comments, suggestions, or 
concerns.  Our internal policy committees will receive and take your comments into consideration. 
 
For utilization and medical policy feedback, please send comments to: MedPolicy@blueshieldca.com
 
 
Disclaimer: This medical policy is a guide in evaluating the medical necessity of a particular service or treatment. 
Blue Shield of California may consider published peer-reviewed scientific literature, national guidelines, and local 
standards of practice in developing its medical policy. Federal and state law, as well as contract language, 
including definitions and specific contract provisions/exclusions, take precedence over medical policy and must 
be considered first in determining covered services. Member contracts may differ in their benefits. Blue Shield 
reserves the right to review and update policies as appropriate.
