Coding 
See the Codes table for details. 
 
Description 
 
Oncology diagnostic, prognostic and algorithmic tests combine biomarkers and/or clinical data into 
an algorithm to generate a disease risk assessment, prognostic result, or clinical recommendation for 
treatment. Testing methodologies commonly include Gene Expression Profiling (GEP), which analyzes 
messenger RNA (mRNA) typically of multiple genes simultaneously, multimarker serum analysis, 
single-nucleotide variant testing, plasma-based proteomic analysis, and incorporation of other 
clinical data into test outputs.   
 
In addition to the tests previously mentioned, proteogenomic testing is an emerging area. 
Proteogenomic testing combines the analysis of DNA with RNA and/or protein analysis. The current 
focus of proteogenomics is primarily on diagnostic and prognostic analyses in various cancers. 
Results also seek to provide potential treatment options, and to which treatments the cancer may be 
resistant.

Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) tests are another emerging area. These tests combine information from 
population SNP analysis with clinical and family history and aim to give additional insight into an 
individual's lifetime risk to develop a specific cancer.  
Results of oncology algorithmic tests are often reported as a recurrence score, probability of distant 
disease recurrence, malignant potential, probable site of origin, or cancer risk score. Additionally, the 
output of these algorithmic tests may be useful to assist in surgical and management decision-
making and to identify individuals who may benefit from adjuvant therapy. 
 
In keeping with the language used in National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines, 
the terms “male” and “female” refer to sex assigned at birth.

Benefit Application 
 
Benefit determinations should be based in all cases on the applicable contract language. To the 
extent there are any conflicts between these guidelines and the contract language, the contract 
language will control. Please refer to the member's contract benefits in effect at the time of service to 
determine coverage or non-coverage of these services as it applies to an individual member.  
 
Some state or federal mandates (e.g., Federal Employee Program [FEP]) prohibits plans from 
denying Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved technologies as investigational. In these 
instances, plans may have to consider the coverage eligibility of FDA-approved technologies on the 
basis of medical necessity alone. 
 
Regulatory Status 
 
State: 
Starting on July 1, 2022 (per CA law SB 535) for commercial plans regulated by the California 
Department of Managed Healthcare and California Department of Insurance (PPO and HMO), 
health care service plans and insurers shall not require prior authorization for biomarker testing, 
including biomarker testing for cancer progression and recurrence, if a member has stage 3 or 4 
cancer. Health care service plans and insurers can still do a medical necessity review of a biomarker 
test and possibly deny coverage after biomarker testing has been completed and a claim is 
submitted (post service review).

SB 496 requires health plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Act ("Plans"), Medi-Cal managed care 
plans ("MCPS"), and health insurers ("Insurers") to cover biomarker testing for the diagnosis, 
treatment, appropriate management, or ongoing monitoring of an enrollee's disease or condition to 
guide treatment decisions, as prescribed. The bill does not require coverage of biomarker testing for 
screening purposes. Restricted or denied use of biomarker testing for these purposes is subject to 
state and federal grievance and appeal processes. Where biomarker testing is deemed medically 
necessary, Plans and Insurers must ensure that the testing is provided in a way that limits disruptions 
in care. 
 
Rationale 
 
BREAST CANCER  
Breast Cancer Treatment and Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
Oncotype DX for breast cancer is a 21-gene expression assay. NCCN guidelines for Breast Cancer 
(4.2024) recommend the 21-gene expression assay for both prognosis and treatment decisions in the 
following patients: 
• Patients of either sex (p. BINV-J 1 of 2) 
• Evidence level 1: Postmenopausal patients with a ductal/NST, lobular, mixed, or 
micropapillary tumor that is pT1–3, and at least 0.5cm, with pN1mi (2 mm or smaller axillary 
node metastases) or pN1 (1–3 positive nodes). Tumor must be HR positive, HER2 negative. (p. 
BINV-6, BINV-N 1 of 5, BINV-N 2 of 5) 
• Evidence level 1: Premenopausal patient with a ductal/NST, lobular, mixed, or micropapillary 
tumor that is at least 0.5cm and pN0. Tumor must be HR positive, HER2 negative. (p. BINV-7, 
BINV-N 1 of 5, BINV-N 2 of 5) 
• Evidence level 2A: Premenopausal patient with a ductal/NST, lobular, mixed, or 
micropapillary tumor that is at least 0.5cm and pN1mi (2 mm or smaller axillary node 
metastasis) or pN1 (1–3 positive nodes). Tumor must be HR positive, HER2 negative. (p. BINV-
8, BINV-N 1 of 5, BINV-N 2 of 5) 
 
Breast Cancer Extended Endocrine Therapy Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
The BCI (Breast Cancer Index) is recommended by NCCN Breast Cancer guidelines (4.2024) for both 
indications of prognosis as well as predicting treatment for extended adjuvant endocrine therapy. 
Appropriate patients for this test are:  
• Evidence level 2A: Postmenopausal patients with a ductal/NST, lobular, mixed, or 
micropapillary tumor that is pT1–3, and 0.5cm or larger, with pN1mi (2 mm or smaller axillary 
node metastases) or pN1 (1–3 positive nodes). Tumor must be HR positive, HER2 negative. (p. 
BINV-6, BINV-N 1 of 5, BINV-N 4 of 5) 
• Evidence level 2A: Premenopausal patients with a ductal/NST, lobular, mixed, or 
micropapillary tumor that is at least 0.5cm and pN0. Tumor must be HR positive, HER2 
negative. (p. BINV-7, BINV-N 1 of 5, BINV-N 4 of 5) 
• Evidence level 2A: Premenopausal patients with a ductal/NST, lobular, mixed, or 
micropapillary tumor that is at least 0.5cm and pN1mi (2 mm or smaller axillary node 
metastasis) or pN1 (1–3 positive nodes). Tumor must be HR positive, HER2 negative. (p. BINV-
8, BINV-N 1 of 5, BINV-N 4 of 5) 
• Data are limited regarding the use of molecular assays to assess prognosis and to predict 
benefit from chemotherapy in males with breast cancer. Available data suggest the 21-gene 
assay recurrence score provides prognostic information in males with breast cancer (p. BINV-
J 1 of 2)

American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
In 2022, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) issued a statement regarding the use of 
Breast Cancer Index testing for extended endocrine therapy for ER-positive HER2-negative breast 
cancer.  Their recommendations are as follows: 
- Recommendation 1.24: If a patient has node-negative or node-positive breast cancer with 1-3 
positive nodes and has been treated with 5 years of primary endocrine therapy without 
evidence of recurrence, the clinician may offer the BCI test to guide decisions about extended 
end  ocrine therapy with either tamoxifen, an AI, or a sequence of tamoxifen followed by AI 
(Type: evidence-based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: 
moderate).  
- Recommendation 1.25: If a patient has node-positive breast cancer with 4 or more positive 
nodes and has been treated with 5 years of primary endocrine therapy without evidence of 
recurrence, there is insufficient evidence to use the BCI test to guide decisions about extended 
endocrine therapy with either tamoxifen, an AI, or a sequence of tamoxifen followed by AI 
(Type: evidence-based; Evidence quality: intermediate; Strength of recommendation: strong). 
 
Breast Cancer Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
The 2022 ASCO guideline update for Biomarkers for Adjuvant Endocrine and Chemotherapy in Early-
Stage Breast Cancer provides guidance for the diagnostic indications for several breast cancer 
prognostic algorithmic tests, including EndoPredict, MammaPrint, and Prosigna (among others). 
Figure 1 summarizes the following: if a female patient is postmenopausal or older than age 50 years, 
has early-stage invasive breast cancer, node negative disease, and a HER2 negative, ER positive 
tumor, then EndoPredict, Prosnigna, or MammaPrint may be ordered. However, if the patient has 1 to 
3 positive node disease, MammaPrint or EndoPredict may be ordered. (p. 1821)  
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Breast Cancer guidelines (4.2024) recommend consideration of other prognostic gene 
expression assays to help assess risk of recurrence in pre-  and postmenopausal patients with HR-
positive, Her2-negative pT1-3 and pN0 or pN+ tumors, but these other tests have not been validated 
to predict response to chemotherapy. (p. BINV-  6, BINV-7, BINV-8) Gene expression assays can 
provide prognostic and treatment-predictive information that can be used with T,N,M and biomarker 
information. These prognostic gene expression assays can provide prognostic information but the 
ability to predict chemotherapy benefit has not been shown. (p. BINV-N, 1 of 5, 3 of 5) 
 
Gene Expression Profiling Breast Cancer Subtyping Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Breast Cancer guidelines (4.2024) do not reference gene expression profiling tests (i.e., 
Blueprint) for the purpose of subtyping breast cancer to provide information for clinical decision-
making. 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology 
The ASCO Guideline Update on Biomarkers for Adjuvant Endocrine and Chemotherapy in Early Stage 
Breast Cancer (2022) does not include breast cancer subtyping tests (i.e., BluePrint) as recommended 
biomarker tests for guiding adjuvant therapy.   
 
Concert Note 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of this test. No recommendations for or against this 
testing within standard professional society guidelines covering this area of testing were identified. 
 
Breast DCIS Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “MolDX: Oncotype DX Breast Cancer for DCIS 
(Genomic Health)” includes the following coverage criteria for OncotypeDX DCIS: 

BSC_CON_2.05 Oncology: Algorithmic Testing

Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
“The Oncotype DX DCIS assay is covered only when the following clinical conditions are met: 
• Pathology (excisional or core biopsy) reveals ductal carcinoma in situ of the breast (no 
pathological evidence of invasive disease), and 
• FFPE specimen with at least 0.5 mm of DCIS length, and 
• Patient is a candidate for and is considering breast conserving surgery alone as well as 
breast conserving surgery combined with adjuvant radiation therapy, and 
• Test result will be used to determine treatment choice between surgery alone vs. surgery with 
radiation therapy, and 
• Patient has not received and is not planning on receiving a mastectomy.” 
 
COLORECTAL CANCER 
Colorectal Cancer Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Colon Cancer (4.2024) does not recommend use of multigene panel assays to 
assist in making clinical decisions about adjuvant therapy. (p. COL-4)
 
 
PROSTATE CANCER 
Prostate Cancer Treatment and Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Prostate Cancer (4.2024) recommend advanced risk stratification tools (i.e., gene 
expression biomarkers, AI digital pathology) when there is the possibility of changing disease 
management in men with localized prostate cancer and life expectancy of 10 yrs or more. (p. PROS-
4,5,6)  The most common reasons to use these tools is for deciding between active surveillance and 
radical treatment, or use of radiation alone vs radiation with androgen deprivation therapy (short or 
long term). These tests can also be useful post prostatectomy with recurrence, when choosing 
radiation with or without androgen deprivation therapy. (p. PROS-H, 1 of 8) These tests should not be 
used for very low risk or very high risk disease as they have not been validated in these populations. 
(p. PROS-H, 1 and 4-6 of 8)  The following tumor-based assays are called out for use: Decipher, 
Genomic Prostate Score, ArteraAI and Prolaris. (p. PROS-H 3 of 8) 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
ASCO (2020) issued a guideline for the use of molecular biomarkers in localized prostate cancer that 
included the following summary of recommendations: 
“Tissue-based molecular biomarkers (evaluating the sample with the highest volume of the highest 
Gleason pattern) may improve risk stratification when added to standard clinical parameters, but the 
Expert Panel endorses their use only in situations in which the assay results, when considered as a 
whole with routine clinical factors, are likely to affect a clinical decision. These assays are not 
recommended for routine use as they have not been prospectively tested or shown to improve long-
term outcomes—for    example, quality of life, need for treatment, or survival.” (p. 1474) 
 
Evidence-Based Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment and Diagnostic Algorithmic Tests 
American Urological Association/Society of Urologic Oncology 
The American Urological Association/Society of Urologic Oncology published guidelines on the early 
detection of prostate cancer (2023). They state that clinicians and patients may use adjunctive urine 
or serum markers to inform the shared decision making process regarding prostate biopsy (initial 
and/or repeat biopsy). It is imperative clinicians are familiar with biomarkers, understand what 
information or data each test provides, and consider whether additional information will impact 
management decisions before ordering a test. (conditional recommendation, evidence level C). (p. 21-
22, 24) Of note, conditional recommendations are non-directive statements used when the evidence 
indicates that there is no apparent net benefit or harm, or when the balance between benefits and 
risks/burden is unclear. For evidence level C, the balance between benefits and risks is unclear but net 
benefit or net harm is comparable to other options.

National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Prostate Cancer Early Detection guidelines (2.2024) recommends consideration of  biomarkers 
that improve the specificity of screening in patients considering biopsy after abnormal PSA and/or 
DRE. Although these biomarker tests are not currently mandated as first-line screening tests in 
conjunction with serum PSA, there may be some patients who could consider biopsy based on PSA 
standards but are seeking further risk clarification. The probability of high-grade cancer (Gleason 
score ≥3+4, Grade Group 2 or higher) may be further defined utilizing the Prostate Health Index (PHI), 
SelectMDx, 4Kscore, ExoDx Prostate Test, MyProstateScore (MPS), and IsoPSA. (p. PROSD-3) Tests 
that improve specificity when considering a repeat biopsy should be considered after negative biopsy 
in patients felt to be at higher risk (p. PROSD-4). These tests include those listed above (except for 
SelectMDX) plus PCA3 and ConfirmMDX.  
 
Emerging Evidence Prostate Cancer Risk Assessment and Diagnostic Algorithmic Tests  
NCCN Prostate Cancer Early Detection guidelines (2.2024) comment on the usefulness of biomarker 
testing to assist in biopsy decision making. The guidelines do not mention the following tests as part 
of recommended clinical care: EpiSwitch Prostate Screening Test (PSE), miR Sentinel Prostate Cancer 
Test, MyProstateScore 2.0, PanGIA Prostate, and Apifiny.   
 
Concert Note 
There is insufficient evidence to support the use of these tests.  At this time, there are no known 
recommendations for or against this testing within standard professional society guidelines covering 
this area of testing as current evidence indicates neither benefit nor harm at this time.  
 
 
THYROID CANCER 
Thyroid Cancer Diagnostic Algorithmic Tests 
 
American Thyroid Association 
The American Thyroid Association (2016) updated its guidelines on the management of thyroid 
nodules and differentiated thyroid cancer in adults. These guidelines made the following statements 
on molecular diagnostics in thyroid nodules: “For nodules with AUS/FLUS [atypia of undetermined 
significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance]... molecular testing may be used to 
supplement malignancy risk assessment in lieu or proceeding directly with either surveillance or 
diagnostic surgery.” (p. 21)  
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Guidelines for Thyroid Carcinoma (3.2024) recommends consideration of  molecular 
diagnostics on fine needle aspirate (FNA) results of thyroid nodules which are classified as Bethesda 
III or Bethesda IV if there is not high clinical and/or radiographic suspicion of malignancy. (p. THYR-1 
and THYR-2) 
 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and 
Associazone Medici Endocrinologi 
The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists, American College of Endocrinology, and 
Associazone Medici Endocrinologi (2016) updated their joint guidelines on molecular testing for 
cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules and endorsed the following: 
• 
TERT mutational analysis may improve the diagnostic sensitivity of molecular testing on 
cytologic samples. (p. 32) 
• There is insufficient evidence to recommend either in favor of or against the use of gene 
expression classifiers for cytologically indeterminate nodules. (p. 10) 
• With the exception of mutations such as 
BRAF V600E, there is insufficient evidence to 
recommend in favor of or against the use of mutation testing to determine the extent of 
surgery. (p. 10)

UVEAL MELANOMA 
Uveal Melanoma Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Uveal Melanoma (1.2024) recommends consideration of biopsy of the primary 
tumor before radiation for prognostic analysis. Molecular testing for prognostication is 
recommended over cytology alone. (p. UM-2A) Tumor class defined by gene expression profiling  was 
more strongly associated with risk of  metastasis than any other prognostic factor. (p. UM-4) 
 
 
CUTANEOUS MELANOMA 
Evidence-Based Cutaneous Melanoma Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
 
ECRI Genetic Test Assessment 
A recent review completed by ECRI (2023) found evidence for the DecisionDx-Melanoma 31-gene 
profiling (31-GEP) test to be somewhat favorable based on the available data pertaining to clinical 
validity, and potential clinical utility of the test. Specifically, the available studies demonstrated that 
they may improve patient outcomes (e.g., overall survival, by informing decisions to escalate 
surveillance when the test is added to best available care (i.e., tumor staging, SLNB). 
Concert Evidence Review for Coverage Determination (Published 12/21/2023, Re-issued 7/1/2024 
with minor updates to test names; no updates to literature) 
 
The current literature suggests that DecisionDx Melanoma (also referred to as 31-GEP in the 
literature) test exhibits high sensitivity (70-95%) and negative predictive value (>90%) in the 
prognosis of stage I and II cutaneous melanoma (CM) at multiple clinical endpoints including risk of 
recurrence, distant-site metastasis occurrence, and melanoma-specific death.  
 
The literature demonstrates that the 31-GEP test has significant evidence of clinical validity and 
utility when incorporated as part of standard clinicopathologic features, both in predicting the 
potential prognosis of a cutaneous melanoma diagnosis as well as the prediction of SLNB positivity. 
Bailey et al (2023) showed that performing the 31-GEP test resulted in higher 3 year melanoma-
specific survival (MSS) and overall survival (OS) in individuals with cutaneous melanoma, compared to 
patients not tested with the 31-GEP (P < 0.001). Additionally, the 31-GEP test was associated with a 
29% lower MSS mortality and 17% lower overall mortality, allowing patients to be stratified by their 
risk. A study by Tassavor et al (2023) showed that the 31-GEP test outperformed the Memorial Sloan 
Kettering Cancer Center nomogram for predicting SLNB positivity in patients with cutaneous 
melanoma (T1-T2 tumors), thereby reducing the number of patients who need invasive procedures.  
Specifically, the study notes: “In patients with T1 tumors, for whom guidance on the clinical decision to 
perform SLNB is least clear, the i31-GEP for SLNB could have reduced the number of SLNBs by 
43.7%, compared with standard NCCN SLNB guidance using AJCC staging, while maintaining a low 
false-negative rate.” (p. 4514) Finally, in a prospective multicenter study, Yamamoto et al (2023) 
showed that overall 85.3% of decisions related to sentinel lymph node biopsy were influenced by 31-
GEP test results in individuals with T1-T2 tumors. Concordance between performing an SLNB and 31-
GEP influence was 78.5%. 
 
Based upon retrospective cohort data, the Merlin assay shows relatively high clinical validity in 
individuals with primary cutaneous melanoma, with a NPV > 95% and elevated levels of sensitivity 
(80% in T1-T2 patients and 92.3% in T1-T3 patients) (Yousaf et al., 2021). Other research shows a 
potential for the Merlin assay to reduce SLNB complications by 50 -  69.1% by reducing the number of 
patients undergoing SLNB (Hieken et al., 2022). There is some evidence that suggests the CP-GEP 
assay can be used to further stratify the risk of recurrence, metastasis, and melanoma specific 
survival in patients (Eggermont et al., 2020).  
 
MelaNodal Predict was added to this evidence review after determining that Melanodal uses the 
Merlin algorithm and is licensed by Quest. For this reason, we are assuming these tests are the same 
and therefore, the evidence review information above will apply to MelaNodal Predict.

Following on a systematic review of available peer-reviewed evidence, cutaneous melanoma 
prognostic algorithmic tests such as DecisionDx-Melanoma and Merlin / MelaNodal Predict, have 
SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE for clinical validity to effectively identify patients with a poorer prognosis 
and for clinical utility in direct more aggressive treatment to promote increased patient survival. 
 
 
Emerging Evidence Cutaneous Melanoma Prognostic Algorithmic Tests 
Concert Evidence Review for Coverage Determination (Published 12/21/2023) 
 
There were no available peer-reviewed studies concerning the AMBlor assay that met inclusion 
criteria for a systematic review. At this time, there is 
INSUFFICIENT EVIDENCE to support the clinical 
validity of this test in identifying early stage melanoma patients with poorer prognoses.  No 
recommendations for or against this testing within standard professional society guidelines covering 
this area of testing were identified. 
 
Cutaneous Melanoma Diagnostic Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Cutaneous Melanoma (2.2024) indicate that gene expression profiling is an 
available test for diagnosing indeterminate melanocytic neoplasms by histopathology, along with 
immunohistochemistry (IHC), comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), fluorescence in situ 
hybridization (FISH), single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array, and next-generation sequencing 
(NGS). These tests may lead to a definitive diagnosis and treatment selection in cases that are 
diagnostically equivocal or controversial by histopathology and NCCN recommends consideration of 
these tests in conjunction with clinical and pathology evaluation. (p. ME-C 1 of 8). 
 
American Academy of Dermatology 
The American Academy of Dermatology (Swetter, 2019) published guidelines of care for the 
management of primary cutaneous melanoma. The guidelines state the following regarding GEP 
tests: 
• Diagnostic molecular techniques are still largely investigative and may be appropriate as 
ancillary tests in equivocal melanocytic neoplasms, but they are not recommended for 
routine diagnostic use in CM. These include comparative genomic hybridization (CGH), 
fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), gene expression profiling (GEP), and (potentially) 
next-generation sequencing. (page 219) 
• Ancillary diagnostic molecular techniques (e.g., CGH, FISH, GEP) may be used for equivocal 
melanocytic neoplasms. (p. 219) 
 
American Society of Dermatopathology 
The American Academy of Dermatopathology (AUC Committee Members, 2022) published conditions 
where a 23 gene qRT-PCR test (MyPath Melanoma) was determined by a review of published 
evidence to be “majority usually appropriate.” These include the differential diagnosis of nevus versus 
melanoma in fully sampled histopathologically ambiguous tumors, partially sampled nevus versus 
melanoma in adults, nevus versus nevoid melanoma, and nevus versus melanoma in cosmetically 
sensitive sites and special sites in pediatric patients. These recommendations specifically exclude 
scenarios where pathology is definitive for melanoma or for distinction between incompletely 
sampled sclerosing (desmoplastic) nevus versus desmoplastic melanoma. (p. 237-8)  
 
Cutaneous Melanoma Risk Assessment Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Guidelines for Cutaneous Melanoma (2.2024) recommends consideration of  pre-diagnostic 
noninvasive patch testing to help inform  decisions regarding biopsy for patients with melanocytic 
neoplasms that are clinically/dermoscopically suspicious for melanoma. (p. ME-12)

ECRI Genetic Test Assessment 
A recent review completed by ECRI (2023) found evidence for the Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA) to be 
somewhat favorable based on the available data demonstrating clinical validity and utility to 
improve patient outcomes when added to standard of care. (p. 1) 
 
American Academy of Dermatology 
In their 2019 publication, the American Academy of Dermatology stated the following: Skin biopsy 
remains the first step to establish a definitive diagnosis of CM, although various molecular and 
imaging techniques have been studied as adjuncts to histopathologic assessment of melanocytic 
neoplasms. (p. 211) 
 
Newer noninvasive techniques (eg, reflectance confocal microscopy [RCM], as well as electrical 
impedance spectroscopy, gene expression analysis, optical coherence tomography, and others can 
also be considered as these become more readily available. (p. 211) 
 
UpToDate Melanoma: Clinical Features and diagnosis 
Patients with a pigmented lesion that is changing and has additional ABCDE (asymmetry, border

clinical encounter. For rare cases where more than 2 tests are indicated in a single clinical encounter, 
an appeal with supporting documentation may be submitted for additional tests.” 
 
OVARIAN CANCER 
Ovarian Cancer Diagnostic Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer (3.2024) 
recognize that a number of specific biomarkers and algorithms using multiple biomarker test results 
have been proposed for preoperatively distinguishing benign from malignant tumors in patients who 
have an undiagnosed adnexal/pelvic mass.  Currently, the NCCN Panel does not recommend the use 
of these biomarker tests for evaluation  of an undiagnosed adnexal/pelvic mass. (p. MS-10, MS-11)     
 
Ovarian Cancer Treatment Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer (3.2024) 
recommend genetic risk evaluation, and germline and somatic testing if not previously done, 
including 
BRCA1/2 to guide maintenance therapy for patients with ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary 
peritoneal cancer. If a patient does not have a germline 
BRCA1/2 mutation, homologous 
recombination status may help determine the benefit of PARP inhibitor therapy. (p. OV-1)  
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
ASCO (2020) issued a guideline for the use of PARP inhibitors in the management of ovarian cancer, 
which included the following summary of recommendations: 
“The guideline pertains to patients who are PARPi naïve. All patients with newly diagnosed, stage III-
IV EOC (epithelial ovarian, tubal, or primary peritoneal cancer), whose disease is in complete or 
partial response to first-line, platinum-based chemotherapy with high-grade serous or endometrioid 
EOC should be offered PARPi maintenance therapy with niraparib. For patients with germline or 
somatic pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants in 
BRCA1 (g/sBRCA1) or BRCA2 (g/sBRCA2) genes, 
should be treated with olaparib. The addition of olaparib to bevacizumab may be offered to patients 
with stage III-IV EOC with g/s
BRCA1/2 and/or genomic instability and a partial or complete response 
to chemotherapy plus bevacizumab combination. Maintenance therapy (second line or more) with

single-agent PARPi may be offered for patients with EOC who have not received a PARPi and have 
responded to platinum-based therapy regardless of 
BRCA mutation status. Treatment with a PARPi 
should be offered to patients with recurrent EOC that has not recurred within 6 months of platinum-
based therapy, who have not received a PARPi and have a g/s
BRCA1/2, or whose tumor 
demonstrates genomic instability. PARPis are not recommended for use in combination with 
chemotherapy, other targeted agents, or immune-oncology agents in the recurrent setting outside 
the context of a clinical trial. Recommendations for managing specific adverse events are presented. 
Data to support reuse of PARPis in any setting are needed.” (p. 3) 
 
GYNECOLOGIC CANCER 
Gynecologic Cancer Treatment Algorithmic Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Ovarian Cancer, Fallopian Tube Cancer, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer (3.2024) 
state that chemosensitivity/resistance assays have been proposed for informing decisions related to 
future chemotherapy if there are multiple equivalent chemotherapy options available.  This has a 
category 3 level of evidence which indicates that there is major NCCN disagreement that the 
intervention is appropriate. (p. OV-C, 1 of 12)  
 
NCCN guidelines for Cervical Cancer (3.2024) do not mention chemosensitivity or chemoresistance 
assays as part of clinical care. 
 
NCCN guidelines for Uterine Neoplasms (2.2024) do not mention chemosensitivity or 
chemoresistance assays as part of clinical care. 
 
LUNG CANCER 
Evidence-Based Lung Cancer Diagnostic Algorithmic Tests 
Concert Evidence Review for Coverage Determination (Published 12/21/23) 
This body of literature includes validation studies for NodifyXL2. These studies were each published 
with authors from the company that developed or currently offer the test, with the exception of the 
2023 study published by Kheir et al examining NodifyXL2. In this case, the authors disclosed no 
conflicts of interest except for the lead author who received honoraria from Biodesix and Veracyte for 
educational events. 
 
Multiple studies have been published on NodifyXL2 and the clinical validity of this test as it pertains 
to identifying the risk of cancer in patients with lung nodules. Two studies published in 2023 (Pritchett 
et al and Kheir et al) examined NodifyXL2 and demonstrated adequate clinical utility. Kheir et al 
published a retrospective study examining patients with lung nodules who were evaluated using the 
integrated proteomic classifier NodifyXL2 compared to standard clinical care during the same period 
of time, with a follow-up time of 1 year. In the study group of 102 patients, fewer invasive procedures 
were performed compared to the non-integrated classifier group of 129 patients (26.5% vs 79.1%; 
P<0.001). Pritchett et al also examined biopsy rates in patients in matched cohorts (197 patients in 
each group). Patients in the study group (tested with NodifyXL2) were 74% less likely to undergo an 
invasive procedure compared to the control group (absolute difference 14%; P<0.001), and for every 7 
patients tested, one unnecessary invasive procedure was avoided.  Both of these studies had similar 
inclusion criteria for patients: age 40 years or older, with a risk for cancer of 50% or less according to 
the Mayo Solitary Pulmonary Nodule calculator, a lung nodule between 8 and 30 mm in diameter, 
and no history of cancer (except non-melanomatous skin cancer) within 5 years of the discovery of 
the lung nodule.

Concert Evidence Review for Coverage Determination (Published 12/21/23) 
Multiple studies have been published on Percepta Bronchial Genomic Classifier and REVEAL Lung 
Nodule Characterization and their ability to identify risk of cancer in patients with lung nodules. This 
body of literature includes studies meant to assess clinical validity for each test. Overall, these studies 

BSC_CON_2.05 Oncology: Algorithmic Testing 
Page 21 of 45 
 
 
Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
inadequately demonstrate the clinical validity of these tests for distinguishing high risk nodules from 
low risk nodules. 
 
Percepta originally had a cost-effectiveness study published in 2017. A new validation study for this 
test was published in 2021 and it is not clear if the new test would also be cost-effective. 
There are a few studies that include some characterization of clinical utility for the Percepta and 
REVEAL Lung Nodule Characterization and their ability to identify risk of cancer in patients with lung 
nodules. But these studies have significant flaws, including small population sizes, and potential bias 
due to authors with conflict of interest. These studies were each published with authors from the 
company that developed or currently offers the test. Additionally, the costs of these tests compared 
to costs of under-  and over-diagnosis of lung cancer in patients with lung nodules needs to be 
completed. To our knowledge, there are currently no randomized controlled trials enrolling for 
Percept or REVEAL. 
 
Tests that have limited established clinical utility or validity as defined in the Concert policy for 
General Approach to Genetic and Molecular testing do not meet the threshold for coverage.  
Evidence for validity may include a Technology Assessment conducted by an independent third party 
(e.g.MolDx Tech, ECRI, Optum Genomic) and/or evidence-based guidelines published by professional 
societies.  Such evidence was not identified for the tests referenced by this policy. 
 
Evidence-Based Lung Cancer Treatment Algorithmic Tests 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “MolDX: Predictive Classifiers for Early Stage 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer” includes the following coverage criteria for lung cancer treatment 
algorithmic tests:  
• “The patient has a non-squamous NSCLC with a tumor size < 5cm, and there are no positive 
lymph nodes (i.e. American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) Eighth Edition Stages I and IIa) 
• The patient is sufficiently healthy to tolerate chemotherapy 
• Adjuvant platinum-containing chemotherapy is being considered for the patient 
• The test is ordered by a physician who is treating the patient for NSCLC (generally a medical 
oncologist, surgeon, or radiation oncologist) to help in the decision of whether or not to 
recommend adjuvant chemotherapy”. 
 
From the Billing and Coding article: 
DetermaRx (PLA code 0288U) is a covered test.

Bladder Cancer Treatment and Recurrence Algorithmic Tests 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “MolDX: Prognostic and Predictive Molecular 
Classifiers for Bladder Cancer” states the following regarding bladder cancer molecular diagnostic 
tests, including algorithmic tests: 
“This contractor will cover molecular diagnostic tests for use in a beneficiary with bladder cancer 
when all of the following conditions are met: 
1. The beneficiary is being actively managed for bladder cancer. 
2. The beneficiary is within the population and has the indication for which the test was 
developed and is covered. The laboratory will make available the appropriate indications of 
the test to the treating/ordering physician. 
3. At least 1 of the 2 criteria are met: 
a. The patient is a candidate for multiple potential treatments, which could be 
considered to have varied or increasing levels of intensity based on a consensus 
guideline, and the physician and patient must decide among these treatments. OR 
b. The patient is a candidate for multiple therapies, and the test has shown that it 
predicts response to a specific therapy among accepted therapy options based on 
nationally recognized society consensus guidelines (i.e., National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network [NCCN], American Society of Clinical Oncology [ASCO], Society of 
Urologic Oncology [SUO], or American Urological Association [AUA]). 
4. The test demonstrates analytical validity including both analytical and clinical validations. If 
the test relies on an algorithm (which may range in complexity from a threshold 
determination of a single numeric value to a complex mathematical or computational 
function), the algorithm must be validated in a cohort that is not a development cohort for 
the algorithm. 
5. The test has demonstrated clinical validity and utility, establishing a clear and significant 
biological/molecular basis for stratifying patients and subsequently selecting (either 
positively or negatively) a clinical management decision (in 4. above) in a clearly defined 
population. 
6. The test successfully completes a Molecular Diagnostic Services Program (MolDX®) technical 
assessment that ensures the test is reasonable and necessary as described above. 
7. Only 1 test may be performed prior to the initiation of therapy UNLESS a second test that 
interrogates different genomic content AND meets all the criteria established herein, is 
reasonable and necessary. 
8. The genomic content interrogated by the test must be relevant to the therapy under 
consideration.” 
 
PANCREATIC CANCER 
Evidence-Based Pancreatic Cyst Risk Assessment Algorithmic Tests  
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “Loss-of -Heterozygosity Based Topographic 
Genotyping with PathfinderTG” includes the following coverage criteria for PathfinderTG (currently 
known as PancraGen):  
“PathfinderTG will be considered medically reasonable and necessary when selectively used as an 
occasional second-line diagnostic supplement: 
• Only where there remains clinical uncertainty as to either the current malignancy or the 
possible malignant potential of the pancreatic cyst based upon a comprehensive first-line 
evaluation; AND 
• A decision regarding treatment (e.g. surgery) has NOT already been made based on existing 
information. 
The specific requirements for medical necessity involve: 
• Highly-concise affirmation, documented in the medical record, that a decision regarding 
treatment has not already been made and that the results of the molecular evaluation will 
assist in determining if more aggressive treatment than what is being considered is

necessary. 
 
• Previous first-line diagnostics, such as, but not restricted to, the following have 
demonstrated: 
o A pancreatic cyst fluid carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is greater than or equal to 
200 ng/ml, suggesting a mucinous cyst, but is not diagnostic. 
o Cyst cytopathologic or radiographic findings, which raise the index of malignancy 
suspicion, but where second-line molecular diagnostics is expected to be more 
compelling in the context of a surgical vs. non-surgical care plan. 
Specific criteria of Non-coverage to include either: 
• Image guided needle aspiration of the pancreatic cyst or cystic component of a mass lesion 
or dilated duct demonstrate definitive diagnosis of malignancy by cytology; OR 
Cytology not showing malignancy but meets AGA guidelines to reach a definitive diagnosis of 
benign disease. Lesions must be: 
o Under 1 cm; 
o Lack a solid component; 
o Lack concerning cytology features; 
o Lack main pancreatic duct dilatation of > 1cm in diameter with absence of abrupt change 
in duct diameter; 
o Have fluid CEA level not exceeding 5 ng/ml”.

CANCER OF UNKNOWN PRIMARY 
Cancer of Unknown Primary Gene Expression Profiling Tests 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for Occult Primary (Cancer of Unknown Primary) (1.2025) state that gene

Definitions of Decision Determinations 
 
Medically Necessary: Services that are Medically Necessary include only those which have been 
established as safe and effective, are furnished under generally accepted professional standards to 
treat illness, injury or medical condition, and which, as determined by Blue Shield, are: (a) consistent 
with Blue Shield medical policy; (b) consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis; (c) not furnished 
primarily for the convenience of the patient, the attending Physician or other provider; (d) furnished 
at the most appropriate level which can be provided safely and effectively to the patient; and (e) not 
mor   e costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent 
therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the Member’s illness, injury, or 
disease. 
 
Investigational/Experimental:   A treatment, procedure, or drug is investigational when it has not 
been recognized as safe and effective for use in treating the particular condition in accordance with 
generally accepted professional medical standards. This includes services where approval by the 
federal or state governmental is required prior to use, but has not yet been granted.   
 
Split Evaluation:   Blue Shield of California/Blue Shield of California Life & Health Insurance Company 
(Blue Shield) policy review can result in a split evaluation, where a treatment, procedure, or drug will 
be considered to be investigational for certain indications or conditions, but will be deemed safe and 
effective for other indications or conditions, and therefore potentially medically necessary in those 
instances. 
 
Prior Authorization Requirements and Feedback (as applicable to your plan) 
 
Within five days before the actual date of service, the provider must confirm with Blue Shield that the 
member's health plan coverage is still in effect. Blue Shield reserves the right to revoke an 
authorization prior to services being rendered based on cancellation of the member's eligibility. Final 
determination of benefits will be made after review of the claim for limitations or exclusions.  
 
Questions regarding the applicability of this policy should be directed to the Prior Authorization 
Department at   (800) 541-6652, or the Transplant Case Management Department at (800) 637-2066
