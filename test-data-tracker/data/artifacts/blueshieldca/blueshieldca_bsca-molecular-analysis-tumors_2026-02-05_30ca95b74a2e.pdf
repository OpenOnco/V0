the body. Treatment may be given to help shrink the tumor, slow the growth of cancer cells, or 
relieve symptoms. 
3. Myeloproliferative Neoplasms: Rare overlapping blood diseases in which the bone marrow 
makes too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. There are seven subcategories 
of myeloproliferative neoplasms:

Description 
 
The molecular analysis of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies aims to identify somatic 
oncogenic mutations in cancer.  These mutations, often called “driver” mutations, are becoming 
increasingly useful for targeted therapy selection, and may give insight into prognosis and treatment 
response in a subset of cancers.  In addition, molecular analysis of solid tumors and hematologic 
malignancies, in particular, can aid in making a diagnosis of a specific type of malignancy.  For solid 
tumors, molecular analysis can be performed via direct testing of the tumor (which is addressed in 
this policy) or via circulating tumor DNA or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) (see Other Related Policies).  
For hematologic malignancies, molecular analysis can be performed on blood samples or bone 
marrow biopsy samples. 
 
For individuals with advanced cancer, somatic genomic profiling offers the potential to evaluate a 
large number of genetic markers in the cancer simultaneously in order to provide potential treatment 
options beyond the current standard of care. 
 
While the primary goal of the molecular analysis of solid tumors and hematologic malignancies is to 
identify biomarkers that diagnose or to give prognostic and treatment selection information, this 
testing also has the potential to uncover clinically relevant germline variations that are associated 
with a hereditary cancer susceptibility syndrome, and other conditions, if confirmed to be present in 
the germline. Providers should communicate the potential for these incidental findings with their 
patients prior to somatic mutation profiling. Clinical decision making should not be made based on 
variants of uncertain significance. Current tumor testing strategies include tumor-only testing, 
tumor-normal paired testing with germline variant subtraction, and tumor-normal paired testing 
with explicit analysis of a group of genes associated with germline cancer predisposition. This is an 
evolving area and clear guidelines around the optimal approach for identification and reporting of 
the presumed germline pathogenic variants (PGPVs) are emerging. 
 
In addition to evaluating tumors for driver mutations, molecular testing can also be useful in 
identifying other valuable information such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite 
instability (MSI) and gene fusions. Testing to identify these tumor characteristics can be performed 
for many different types of tumors (tumor agnostic) and can be helpful in predicting tumor response 
to specific treatments such as immunotherapy.  It is also possible to analyze complete tumor DNA via 
exome or genome sequencing; this is an area of ongoing research to determine the best use of the 
potentially large volume of information available from this technology.

Information from tumor molecular testing can also be useful for monitoring measurable (minimal) 
residual disease (MRD) in both solid tumors and hematologic malignancies. These tests can be used 
to determine disease recurrence or relapse after treatment in addition to monitoring disease 
progression or response to various cancer treatments. This is also an area of active research to 
determine the clinical utility and validity of this testing across multiple tumor types.

Benefit Application 
 
Benefit determinations should be based in all cases on the applicable contract language. To the 
extent there are any conflicts between these guidelines and the contract language, the contract 
language will control. Please refer to the member's contract benefits in effect at the time of service to 
determine coverage or non-coverage of these services as it applies to an individual member.  
 
Some state or federal mandates (e.g., Federal Employee Program [FEP]) prohibits plans from 
denying Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved technologies as investigational. In these 
instances, plans may have to consider the coverage eligibility of FDA-approved technologies on the 
basis of medical necessity alone. 
 
Regulatory Status 
 
State: 
Starting on July 1, 2022 (per CA law SB 535) for commercial plans regulated by the California 
Department of Managed Healthcare and California Department of Insurance (PPO and HMO), 
health care service plans and insurers shall not require prior authorization for biomarker testing, 
including biomarker testing for cancer progression and recurrence, if a member has stage 3 or 4 
cancer. Health care service plans and insurers can still do a medical necessity review of a biomarker 
test and possibly deny coverage after biomarker testing has been completed and a claim is 
submitted (post service review).

SB 496 requires health plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Act ("Plans"), Medi-Cal managed care 
plans ("MCPS"), and health insurers ("Insurers") to cover biomarker testing for the diagnosis, 
treatment, appropriate management, or ongoing monitoring of an enrollee's disease or condition to 
guide treatment decisions, as prescribed. The bill does not require coverage of biomarker testing for 
screening purposes. Restricted or denied use of biomarker testing for these purposes is subject to 
state and federal grievance and appeal processes. Where biomarker testing is deemed medically 
necessary, Plans and Insurers must ensure that the testing is provided in a way that limits disruptions 
in care. 
 
Rationale 
 
Tumor-Type Agnostic Solid Tumor Molecular Profiling Panels 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
The NCCN guidelines on Breast Cancer (4.2024) recommend comprehensive somatic testing to aid in 
clinical management of patients with recurrent/stage IV breast cancer. (p. BINV-18) 
 
The NCCN guideline on Occult Primary (1.2025) recommends MSI and MMR testing as part of the 
initial work up for patients with cancer of unknown primary. The guideline further recommends 
consideration of somatic tumor profiling to identify actionable genomic aberrations after a 
histological determination of the tumor has been made. (p. OCC-1)  
 
The NCCN guideline on Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer (7.2024) has several recommendations 
regarding biomarker testing: 
• For stage IV / advanced or metastatic disease, broad molecular profiling is recommended to 
be performed for adenocarcinoma, large cell, or NSCLC not otherwise specified. NCCN 
recommends consideration of broad molecular profiling for squamous cell carcinoma of the 
lung (p. NSCL-14, NSCL-19).    
• Generally, it is recommended that broad, panel-based genomic profiling be performed via 
NGS when feasible. NCCN defines broad molecular profiling as a panel which includes all the 
following biomarkers in either one assay or several smaller assays: 
EGFR, ALK, KRAS, ROS1, 
BRAF, NTRK1/2/3
, METex14 skipping, RET, ERBB2 (HER2), and PD-L1. (p. NSCL-19 and NSCL-
H 1 and 2 of 8)  
• Repeat somatic genetic testing can be helpful to aid in deciding next therapeutic steps when 
a patient’s tumor shows evidence of progression on first-line therapy. Broad genomic 
profiling may be the best testing method to ensure all possible therapeutic biomarkers are 
analyzed. (p. NSCL-H 7 of 8) 
 
The NCCN guideline for Colon Cancer (4.2024) recommends all patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer have molecular testing which should be done via a broad panel to identify rare and 
actionable alterations including fusions (p. COL-2). l. Testing can be performed on the primary tumor 
and/or metastases. (p. COL-B 4 of 10) 
 
The NCCN guideline for Gastric Cancer (2.2024) recommends consideration of NGS testing during the 
workup for gastric cancer (p. GAST-1). NGS testing can be considered in place of sequential testing for 
individual biomarkers if there is limited tissue or traditional biopsy cannot be done in patients with 
inoperable locally advanced, recurrent or metastatic adenocarcinoma of the stomach considering an 
FDA approved therapy. (p. GAST-B 5 of 6) The guidelines also recommend that repeat tumor testing 
can be considered when there is clinical or radiologic evidence for disease progression of advanced 
gastric cancer. (p. GAST-B, 3 of 6)   
 
The NCCN guideline for Ovarian Cancer Including Fallopian Tumor Cancer and Primary Peritoneal 
Cancer (3.2024) recommends that patients with recurrent disease undergo comprehensive tumor 

BSC_CON_2.04 Oncology: Molecular Analysis Of Solid Tumors And Hematologic Malignancies

Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
molecular analysis to identify alterations that would be amenable to targeted therapeutics that have 
tumor specific or tumor-agnostic benefit. (p OV-6) These guidelines also recommend that molecular 
testing be performed on the most recent tumor tissue available. (p. OV-B, 1 of 3) 
 
The NCCN guideline for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (3.2024) recommends tumor/somatic molecular 
profiling to identify targetable alterations for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease 
and recommends consideration of this testing for patients with resectable or borderline resectable 
disease who are candidates for systemic therapy. Testing can include but is not limited to fusions 
(
ALK, NRG1, NTRK, ROS1, FGFR2, RET), mutations (BRAF, BRCA1/2, KRAS, PALB2), amplifications 
(
HER2), MSI, tumor mutational burden and mismatch repair deficiency. (p. PANC-1A, PANC-F, 1 of 12) 
The NCCN guideline for Prostate Cancer (4.2024) recommends consideration of somatic multigene 
tumor testing to identify alterations in HRR genes in addition to MSI and TMB testing for patients 
with metastatic prostate cancer. NCCN recommends consideration of this testing in patients with 
regional prostate cancer.  The guidelines also recommend that repeat tumor profiles can be 
considered at the time of progression of disease. (p. PROS-C, 2 of 2) 
 
The NCCN guideline for Histiocytic Neoplasms (2.2024) recommends molecular mutation profiling in 
the work-up/evaluation of Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH), Erdheim-Chester Disease (ECD) and 
Rosai-Dorfman Disease (RDD) for prognostic and treatment information. (p. HIST-C, 1 of 5) 
The NCCN guideline for Uterine Neoplasms (2.2024) recommends comprehensive molecular profiling, 
in the initial evaluation of uterine neoplasms. This can be done on the initial biopsy or the 
hysterectomy specimen. (p. ENDO-A 2 of 4) 
 
NCCN guidelines for Ampullary Adenocarcinoma (2.2024) recommend somatic molecular profiling to 
identify uncommon and potentially actionable mutations including fusions, amplifications, MSI, 
dMMR, and TMB for patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease who are candidates for 
systemic therapy. (p. AMP-6)     
 
NCCN guidelines for Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (2.2024) recommend molecular testing for a

HLA Typing for Transplantation 
UpToDate: Human leukocyte antigens (HLA): A roadmap 
For patients who are undergoing or being evaluated for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, full 
HLA typing is required. 
 
UpToDate: Donor selection for hematopoietic cell transplantation 
HLA typing is an important part of the process in achieving a successful hematopoietic cell 
transplantation (HCT). Matching HLA class I (-A, -B,    -C) and class II (-DRB1 and -DQB1) haplotypes in 
both the candidate and donor is recommended to increase success of allogeneic HCT.  
 
NMDP, formerly known as the National Marrow Donor Program and Be The Match 
“These guidelines were developed jointly by NMDP and the American Society for Transplantation and 
Cellular Therapy (ASTCT). The guidelines are based on current clinical practice, medical literature, 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Guidelines for the treatment of cancer and 
evidence-based reviews.” 
 
“If allogeneic transplant is potentially indicated, you should perform HLA typing of the patient and 
potential family donors at diagnosis. In addition, a preliminary unrelated donor search of the NMDP 
Registry should be completed.” 
 
Organ Procurement and Transplantation Network (OPTN)  
The OPTN (effective date: 4/2/2024) includes a section titled “Requirements for Performing and 
Reporting HLA Typing”, in which it states: 
“Laboratories must perform HLA typing on a kidney, kidney-pancreas, pancreas, or pancreas islet 
candidate and report results for HLA A, B, Bw4, Bw6, and DR to the transplant program prior to 
registration on the waiting list.” (p. 52) 
 
Additionally, the document states: 
“Laboratories performing histocompatibility testing for kidney transplants or multi-organ transplants 
in which a kidney is to be transplanted must perform a final crossmatch and report the results to the 
Transplant Program before transplant. (p. 55) 
 
Tait, et al 
In 2013, Tait et al. created a list of technical test recommendations for pre and post solid organ 
transplantation. Per the article: 
“HLA typing of donor and recipient must be performed at a level required for accurate antibody 
interpretation. When a patient is sensitized, precise characterization of HLA antibodies and complete 
HLA typing of the donor pretransplantation must be performed.” (p. 37) 
Of note, there is no mention of performing HLA Typing post-transplantation. 
 
MEASUREABLE (MINIMAL) RESIDUAL DISEASE (MRD) ANALYSIS 
Hematologic Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
The NCCN guidelines for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (2.2024) recommend baseline flow 
cytometric and/or molecular characterization of leukemic clone(s) to be used in subsequent 
minimal/measurable residual disease (MRD) analysis. (p. ALL-1) After treatment induction, MRD is 
recommended to determine consolidation therapy. (p. ALL-5)    
 
The NCCN guidelines for Multiple Myeloma (4.2024) recommend consideration of a baseline clone 
identification and storage of an aspirate sample for MRD testing by NGS in the initial diagnostic 
workup (p. MYEL-1) or prognostication during follow up after primary treatment. (p. MYEL-4)     
The NCCN guidelines for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia/Small Lymphocytic Lymphoma (3.2024) 
recommend minimal residual disease testing at the end of treatment for CLL/SLL as an important

predictor of treatment effectiveness. MRD evaluation can be done using flow cytometry, PCR or NGS 
assay. (p. CSLL-E, 2 of 2) 
 
Evidence-Based Solid Tumor Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “MolDX: Minimal Residual Disease Testing for 
Cancer” states the following regarding the use of minimally invasive molecular DNA and RNA tests 
that detect minimal residual disease (MRD) in patients with a personal history of cancer:  
1. The patient has a personal history of cancer, the type and staging of which is within the 
intended use of the MRD test; 
2. The identification of recurrence or progression of disease within the intended use population 
of the test is identified in the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) or other 
established guidelines as a condition that requires a definitive change in patient 
management; 
3. The test is demonstrated to identify molecular recurrence or progression before there is 
clinical, biological or radiographical evidence of recurrence or progression AND demonstrates 
sensitivity and specificity of subsequent recurrence or progression comparable with or 
superior to radiographical or other evidence (as per the standard-of-care for monitoring a 
given cancer type) of recurrence or progression. 
 
“When the patient is NOT known to have cancer (specifically when there is no clinical, radiographical, 
or other biological evidence that tumor cells remain post treatment and subsequently the patient is 
no longer being subjected to therapeutic interventions for cancer), a second kind of test may exist 
wherein a single timepoint may constitute a single test. In such patients, the frequency of MRD 
testing is in accordance with national or society guidelines or recommendations.” 
 
From the billing and coding article: 
“Intended uses that have met clinical validity (CV) criteria under the policy include: (1) the diagnosis of 
disease progression, recurrence, or relapse for advanced colorectal (Natera and Guardant), bladder 
and breast cancers (Natera)....(3) the monitoring of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor therapy 
for colorectal cancer (Guardant) or any solid tumor (Natera). However, the tests listed in the table 
may have only been approved for one or more (but not necessarily all) of these indications. 
“Regarding the use of NGS-based MRD tests (i.e., Signatera) in patients with cancer– The service may 
be performed once per patient per cancer diagnosis, unless there is clinical evidence of a priori 
change in genetic content.” 
 
Concert Note:  
For use of minimal residual disease testing, absent clear, specific and evidence-based guideline 
recommendations for a particular regimen of testing, a default frequency of once per cancer 
diagnosis for patients with cancer or once every 12 months for patients without cancer will be 
adopted. 
 
Emerging Evidence Solid Tumor Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing 
Tests that have limited established clinical utility or validity as defined in the Concert policy for 
General Approach to Genetic and Molecular testing do not meet the threshold for coverage.  
Evidence for validity may include a Technology Assessment conducted by an independent third party 
(e.g. MolDx Tech, ECRI, Optum Genomic) and/or evidence-based guidelines published by 
professional societies.  Such evidence was not identified for the tests referenced by this policy. 
 
HPV-Related Solid Tumor Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) Testing  
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “MolDX: Minimal Residual Disease Testing for

“Intended uses that have met clinical validity (CV) criteria under the policy include: ... (2) the diagnosis 
of disease recurrence or relapse for advanced breast (RaDaR) and HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer 
(Naveris).... However, the tests listed in the table may have only been approved for one or more (but 
not necessarily all) of these indications.” 
 
Concert Note

Definitions of Decision Determinations 
 
Medically Necessary: Services that are Medically Necessary include only those which have been 
established as safe and effective, are furnished under generally accepted professional standards to 
treat illness, injury or medical condition, and which, as determined by Blue Shield, are: (a) consistent 
with Blue Shield medical policy; (b) consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis; (c) not furnished 
primarily for the convenience of the patient, the attending Physician or other provider; (d) furnished 
at the most appropriate level which can be provided safely and effectively to the patient; and (e) not 
more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent 
therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the Member’s illness, injury, or 
disease. 
 
Investigational/Experimental:   A treatment, procedure, or drug is investigational when it has not 
been recognized as safe and effective for use in treating the particular condition in accordance with 
generally accepted professional medical standards. This includes services where approval by the 
federal or state governmental is required prior to use, but has not yet been granted.   
 
Split Evaluation:   Blue Shield of California/Blue Shield of California Life & Health Insurance Company 
(Blue Shield) policy review can result in a split evaluation, where a treatment, procedure, or drug will 
be considered to be investigational for certain indications or conditions, but will be deemed safe and 
effective for other indications or conditions, and therefore potentially medically necessary in those 
instances. 
 
Prior Authorization Requirements and Feedback (as applicable to your plan) 
 
Within five days before the actual date of service, the provider must confirm with Blue Shield that the 
member's health plan coverage is still in effect. Blue Shield reserves the right to revoke an 
authorization prior to services being rendered based on cancellation of the member's eligibility. Final 
determination of benefits will be made after review of the claim for limitations or exclusions.  
 
Questions regarding the applicability of this policy should be directed to the Prior Authorization 
Department at   (800) 541-6652, or the Transplant Case Management Department at (800) 637-2066 
ext.    3507708 or visit the provider portal at www.blueshieldca.com/provider. 
 
We are interested in receiving feedback relative to developing, adopting, and reviewing criteria for 
medical policy. Any licensed practitioner who is contracted with Blue Shield of California or Blue 
Shield of California Promise Health Plan is welcome to provide comments, suggestions, or 
concerns.   Our internal policy committees will receive and take your comments into consideration. 
 
For utilization and medical policy feedback, please send comments to: MedPolicy@blueshieldca.com 
 
Disclaimer: This medical policy is a guide in evaluating the medical necessity of a particular service or treatment. 
Blue Shield of California may consider published peer-reviewed scientific literature, national guidelines, and local 
standards of practice in developing its medical policy. Federal and state law, as well as contract language, 
including definitions and specific contract provisions/exclusions, take precedence over medical policy and must 
be considered first in determining covered services. Member contracts may differ in their benefits. Blue Shield 
reserves the right to review and update policies as appropriate.
