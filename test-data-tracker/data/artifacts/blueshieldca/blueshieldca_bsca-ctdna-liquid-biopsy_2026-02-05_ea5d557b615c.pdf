Policy Guidelines 
 
Definitions 
1. Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA): Fragmented, tumor-derived DNA circulating in the 
bloodstream that is not being carried in a cell. ctDNA derives either directly from the tumor or 
from circulating tumor cells. 
2. Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs): Intact cells that have shed into the bloodstream or lymphatic 
system from a primary tumor or a metastasis site, and are carried around the body by blood 
circulation. 
 
Coding 
See the Codes table for details.

Description 
 
Cell   -free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA or cfDNA) originates directly from the tumor tissue (primary 
or metastasis). As tumor cells die the contents are released into the bloodstream.  Genetic tests 
performed on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), also referred to as a liquid biopsy, potentially offer a 
noninvasive alternative to tissue biopsy for detection of “driver mutations” or acquired genetic 
mutations that may guide targeted therapy, and may also be used to track progression of disease. 
 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are intact tumor cells that are shed from tumor cells into the 
bloodstream or lymphatic system. Most assays detect CTCs through the use of surface epithelial 
markers such as EpCAM and cytokeratins. The primary reason for detecting CTCs is prognostic rather 
than for guiding therapeutic choices, through quantification of circulating levels. 
 
Cell   -free circulating tumor DNA analysis should not be used in lieu of a histologic tissue diagnosis, 
however there are specific clinical considerations, outlined below, where the use of ctDNA may be 
considered. 
 
Cell   -free circulating tumor DNA analysis should not be performed simultaneously with tissue testing 
of a solid tumor, with the exception of lung cancer. 
 
If cell-free circulating tumor DNA analysis is negative, follow-up with tissue-based analysis is 
recommended. 
 
Related Policies 
 
This policy document provides coverage criteria for circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating 
tumor cells testing (liquid biopsy). For other oncology-related testing, please refer to: 
• Oncology: Molecular Analysis of Solid Tumors and Hematologic Malignancies for criteria 
related to DNA testing of a solid tumor or a blood cancer. 
• Genetic Testing: Hereditary Cancer Susceptibility Syndromes for criteria related to genetic 
testing to determine if an individual has an inherited cancer susceptibility syndrome. 
• Oncology: Algorithmic Testing for criteria related to gene expression profiling and tumor 
biomarker tests with algorithmic analyses. 
• Oncology: Cancer Screening for criteria related to the use of non-invasive fecal, urine, or 
blood tests for screening for cancer.

related to circulating tumor DNA or circulating tumor cell testing that is not specifically 
discussed in this or another non-general policy. 
 
Benefit Application 
 
Benefit determinations should be based in all cases on the applicable contract language. To the 
extent there are any conflicts between these guidelines and the contract language, the contract 
language will control. Please refer to the member's contract benefits in effect at the time of service to 
determine coverage or non-coverage of these services as it applies to an individual member.  
 
Some state or federal mandates (e.g., Federal Employee Program [FEP]) prohibits plans from 
denying Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved technologies as investigational. In these 
instances, plans may have to consider the coverage eligibility of FDA-approved technologies on the 
basis of medical necessity alone.

Regulatory Status 
 
State:  
Starting on July 1, 2022 (per CA law SB 535) for commercial plans regulated by the California 
Department of Managed Healthcare and California Department of Insurance (PPO and HMO), 
health care service plans and insurers shall not require prior authorization for biomarker testing, 
including biomarker testing for cancer progression and recurrence, if a member has stage 3 or 4 
cancer. Health care service plans and insurers can still do a medical necessity review of a biomarker 
test and possibly deny coverage after biomarker testing has been completed and a claim is 
submitted (post service review). 
 
SB 496 requires health plans licensed under the Knox-Keene Act ("Plans"), Medi-Cal managed care 
plans ("MCPS"), and health insurers ("Insurers") to cover biomarker testing for the diagnosis, 
treatment, appropriate management, or ongoing monitoring of an enrollee's disease or condition to 
guide treatment decisions, as prescribed. The bill does not require coverage of biomarker testing for 
screening purposes. Restricted or denied use of biomarker testing for these purposes is subject to 
state and federal grievance and appeal processes. Where biomarker testing is deemed medically 
necessary, Plans and Insurers must ensure that the testing is provided in a way that limits disruptions 
in care. 
 
Rationale 
 
Broad Molecular Profiling Panel Tests via Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Prostate Cancer guidelines (4.2024) recommends evaluating tumor for mutations  in 
homologous recombination DNA repair genes (such as 
BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, 
CHEK2, and CDK12) in individuals with metastatic prostate cancer. In addition, MSI evaluation is 
recommended for metastatic prostate cancer.  Plasma circulating tumor (ctDNA) assay is an option if 
biopsy is not able to be performed. (PROS-C, 2 of 2).  
 
NCCN Gastric Cancer guidelines (2.2024) recognize the use of liquid biopsy in patients with advanced 
disease who are unable to have a clinical biopsy for disease surveillance or management.  NCCN 
recommends consideration of a liquid biopsy based comprehensive genomic profiling assay in 
patients who have metastatic or advanced gastric cancer who may be unable to safely undergo a 
traditional biopsy. This testing can identify targetable mutations, clones with altered response 
profiles or monitor for disease progression. A negative result does not exclude the presence of tumor 
mutations or amplifications. (p. GAST-B 5 of 6) 
 
NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma guidelines (3.2024) recommend tumor molecular profiling for 
patients with advanced or metastatic disease if anti-cancer treatment is being considered. While 
testing of tumor tissue is preferred, cell-free DNA testing can be considered if tumor tissue testing is 
not feasible. (p. PANC-1A)  Of note, the recommendation for consideration of molecular testing is also 
included for any patient considering systemic therapy, at all stages of the disease including 
neoadjuvant therapy for resectable or borderline resectable disease. (p. PANC-1A) 
 
NCCN Esophageal and Esophagogastric Junction Cancers guidelines (4.2024) recognize the use of 
liquid biopsy in patients with advanced disease who are unable to have a clinical biopsy for disease 
surveillance or management, NCCN recommends consideration of a liquid biopsy based 
comprehensive genomic profiling assay in patients who have metastatic or advanced cancer whio 
may be unable to safely undergo a traditional biopsy. This testing can identify targetable mutations, 
clones with altered response profiles or monitor for disease progression. A negative result does not 
exclude the presence of tumor mutations or amplifications. (p. ESOPH-B 5 of 6)

NCCN Colon Cancer guidelines (4.2024) recommend broad molecular profiling for detection of 
mutations in RAS, BRAF and other genes along with HER2 amplifications and MSI, for patients with 
suspected or proven metastatic adenocarcinoma and can be done on tissue or blood. (p. COL-2). 
NCCN recommends consideration of repeat testing  after targeted therapy to guide future 
treatment decisions. (p. COL-B, 4 of 10)    
 
NCCN Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer guidelines (7.2024) recommend broad-based  biomarker testing 
using ctDNA only when disease is advanced or metastatic; tissue based testing is preferred for stage 
I-III disease.  Both tissue and ctDNA testing have false negative rates and NCCN recommends 
consideration of complementary testing to increase the likelihood of mutation detection and reduce 
time to results.  (p. NSCL-19, NSCL-H, 8 of 8) 
 
NCCN Cutaneous Melanoma guidelines (2.2024) support the use of cell-free circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) if tumor tissue is unavailable. (p. ME-C 3 of 8) 
BRAF mutation testing is recommended for 
patients with stage III disease who have a high likelihood of recurrence if future 
BRAF-directed 
therapy may be an option. 
KIT gene testing is recommended for stage IV or recurrent disease if 
clinically appropriate. (p. ME-C, 4 of 8) Broader genomic profiling using larger NGS panels or full 
BRAF analysis is recommended if feasible, especially if the test results might guide future treatment 
decisions or eligibility for participation in a clinical trial. If 
BRAF single-gene testing was already done 
and was negative, NCCN recommends consideration of larger NGS panels to identify other potential 
genetic targets. (p. ME-C 4 of 8) 
 
NCCN Ampullary Adenocarcinoma guidelines (2.2024) recommend somatic molecular profiling for 
patients with locally advanced or metastatic disease when systemic therapy is being considered.  
Testing on tumor tissue is preferred but cell-free DNA testing can be considered if tumor tissue 
testing is not feasible. (p. AMP-6)     
 
NCCN Cervical Cancer guidelines (3.2024) recommends consideration of  comprehensive molecular 
profiling for cervical cancer that is persistent or recurrent after treatment.  If biopsy of the metastatic 
site is not feasible or if no tissue is available, testing can be done on circulating tumor DNA. (p. CERV-
11) 
 
NCCN Biliary Tract Cancers guidelines (3.2024) recommend comprehensive molecular profiling for 
patients with unresectable or metastatic biliary tract cancer who are candidates for when systemic 
therapy is an option.  NCCN recommends consideration of a cell-free DNA test if there is not enough 
tissue available or repeat biopsy cannot be done.  (p. BIL-B, 1 of 8) 
 
NCCN Histiocytic Neoplasms guidelines (2.2024) mention molecular testing in the workup for 
histiocytosis and state that if biopsy is not possible due to location or risk factors, mutational analysis 
of peripheral blood is an option (p. LCH-2, ECD-2, RDD-2)     
 
NCCN Neuroendocrine and Adrenal Tumors guidelines (2.2024) recommends consideration of t 
tumor molecular profiling for patients with locoregional unresectable/metastatic extrapulmonary 
poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinoma/large or small cell carcinoma/mixed 
neuroendocrine-non-neuroendocrine neoplasm when systemic therapy is being considered.  Testing 
on tumor tissue is preferred; however, cell-free DNA testing can be considered if tumor tissue testing 
is not feasible. (p. PDNEC-1A)    
 
NCCN Occult Primary guidelines (1.2025) recommend consideration of molecular profiling of tumor 
tissue after an initial determination of histology has been made. Testing on tumor tissue is preferred; 
however, cell-free DNA testing can be considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible. (p. OCC-1A) 
NCCN Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/Primary Peritoneal Cancer guidelines (3.2024) 
recommend somatic testing for 
BRCA1/2 and homologous recombination deficiency status for 
patients at diagnosis and broader molecular testing in the recurrence setting . especially for less

common histologies with limited approved treatment options. Testing may be performed on 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA or liquid biopsy) when tissue-based analysis is not clinically feasible. (p. 
OV-B, 1 of 3)  
 
NCCN Breast Cancer guidelines (4.2024) recommend the use of comprehensive somatic profiling for 
patients with stage IV or recurrent invasive breast cancer to identify candidates for additional 
targeted therapies.  Biomarker testing should be done on at least the first recurrence, and either 
tissue or plasma based assays can be used. (p. BINV-18)   
 
Lung Cancer Focused Panel Tests via Circulating Tumor DNA (ctDNA) 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
The NCCN Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer guidelines (7.2024) recommend biomarker testing for EGFR 
mutations (among others) for patients with advanced or metastatic disease of the following lung 
cancer pathologies: adenocarcinoma, large cell, squamous cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung 
cancer not otherwise specified. (p. NSCL-18). Tissue-based testing and ctDNA both have high 
specificity and false negative rates and therefore can be used together to reduce turnaround time 
and increase the likelihood of finding actionable targets. (p. NSCL-H, 8 of 8) In patients who have 
progressed following targeted therapy, NCCN recommends consideration of biomarker analysis to 
evaluate possible mechanisms of resistance. (p. NSCL-H, 7 of 8)
 
 
EGFR Variant Analysis via ctDNA 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
The NCCN Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer guidelines (7.2024) recommend biomarker testing for EGFR 
mutations (among others) for patients with advanced or metastatic disease of the following lung 
cancer pathologies: adenocarcinoma, large cell, squamous cell carcinoma, and non-small cell lung 
cancer not otherwise specified. (p. NSCL-19) These guidelines also specify that ctDNA testing is not 
typically recommended for clinical settings except those in which the patient has advanced or 
metastatic disease. (p. NSCL-H   8 of 8) 
 
College of American Pathologists, International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, and 
Association for Molecular Pathology 
The College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, 
and the Association for Molecular Pathology (2018) published a guideline on molecular testing for the 
selection of lung cancer patients for treatment with targeted tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) and 
noted the following recommendations regarding liquid biopsy for activating 
EGFR mutations and a 
consensus opinion regarding liquid biopsy for the T790M resistance mutation: 
● Recommendation: "In some clinical settings in which tissue is limited and/or insufficient for 
molecular testing, physicians may use a cfDNA [cell-free DNA] assay to identify [activating] 
EGFR mutations." (p. 337) 
● Expert Consensus Opinion: "Physicians may use plasma cfDNA methods to identify 
EGFR 
T790M mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients with progression or secondary clinical 
resistance to 
EGFR targeted TKIs; testing of the tumor sample is recommended if the plasma 
result is negative." (p. 337) 
● No recommendation: "There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of circulating 
tumor cell molecular analysis for the diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma, the 
identification of 
EGFR or other mutations, or the identification of EGFR T790M mutations at 
the time of 
EGFR TKI resistance." (p. 326) 
 
BRAF Variant Analysis via ctDNA 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Colon Cancer guidelines (4.2024) recommend tumor molecular testing for KRAS, NRAS, and 
BRAF mutations in all patients with metastatic colorectal cancer. This analysis can be done either 
individually or as part of an NGS panel. Additionally, it is noted molecular testing can be performed 
on tissue as a preferred specimen type or blood-based assay. Finally, 
KRAS, NRAS, and BRAF 

BSC_CON_2.10 Oncology: Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells (Liquid Biopsy)

Reproduction without authorization from Blue Shield of California is prohibited 
 
mutation analysis can be performed on either primary colorectal tumors or on metastases. (p. COL-B, 
4 of 10) 
 
NCCN Cutaneous Melanoma guidelines (2.2024) recommend 
BRAF mutation testing for patients with 
cutaneous melanoma of at least stage III who are being considered for 
BRAF directed therapy or 
clinical trials. (p. ME-5A) Additionally, these guidelines state that molecular testing on tumor tissue is 
preferred, but may be performed on peripheral blood (liquid biopsy) if tumor tissue is not available. 
(p. ME-C 3 of 8) 
 
NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma guidelines (3.2024) recommend tumor molecular profiling, 
including 
BRAF, for patients with advanced or metastatic disease who are candidates for systemic  
therapy. Tumor tissue is the preferred specimen for this testing, but cell-free DNA can be considered 
if testing on tissue is not feasible. (p. PANC-1A) 
 
KRAS Variant Analysis via ctDNA

if testing on tissue is not feasible (p. PANC-1A). 
 
PIK3CA Variant Analysis via ctDNA 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Breast Cancer guidelines (4.2024) recommends PIK3CA mutation testing for patients with 
hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative recurrent unresectable or stage IV breast cancer to 
identify candidates for treatment with alpelisib or capivarsertib, plus fulvestrant, as a preferred 
second or subsequent line of therapy. Testing can be done on tumor tissue or ctDNA in peripheral

AR-V7 Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) Analysis 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
The CMS local coverage determination (LCD) entitled “MolDX: Phenotypic Biomarker Detection in 
Circulating Tumor Cells” includes the following coverage criteria for circulating tumor cells (CTCs):  
“The evidence to date supports HER2 testing from CTCs in breast cancer and AR-V7 testing from 
CTCs in prostate cancer...In prostate cancer, the presence of AR-V7 from CTCs is currently the basis 
for making treatment decisions regarding taxane versus ARS inhibitor therapy...”. 
The LCD continues on:  
“Assays that detect biomarkers from CTCs are covered when ALL of the following are met: 
• The specific cancer type has an associated biomarker 
• At least 1 of the following criteria are met AND there is clear documentation of at least 1 of 
these in the medical record: 
o The patient’s cancer has not previously been tested for the specific biomarker, OR 
o The patient has newly metastatic cancer, and a metastatic lesion has not been tested for 
the specific biomarker, OR 
o The patient demonstrates signs of clinical, radiological or pathologic disease progression, 
OR

o There is concern for resistance to treatment based on specific and well-established 
clinical indications 
• Tissue-based testing for the specific biomarker is infeasible (e.g., quantity not sufficient or 
invasive biopsy is medically contraindicated) OR will not provide sufficient information for 
subsequent medical management (e.g., in cases where human epidermal growth factor 
receptor 2 (HER2) overexpression is negative in a tissue biopsy but may be positive in the 
CTCs, due to tumor heterogeneity). There is clear documentation of at least 1 of these reasons 
for testing in the medical record. 
• For a given patient encounter, only 1 test for assessing the biomarker may be performed 
UNLESS a second test, meeting all the criteria established herein, is reasonable and 
necessary as an adjunct to the first test. 
• Duplicate testing of the same biomarker (from the same sample type and for the same 
clinical indication) using different methodologies is not covered. For example, testing for 
androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) from CTCs by messenger RNA (mRNA) as well as 
immunohistochemistry (IHC)-based methodologies, for the same clinical indication, will not 
be covered.” 
 
Circulating Tumor Cell (CTC) Enumeration Analysis 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Breast Cancer guidelines (4.2024) mention that guidance for clinical use of circulating tumor 
cells (CTC) in metastatic breast cancer assessment and monitoring is not currently part of the 
guideline. Studies mentioned showed that enumeration of circulating tumor cells did not have 
predictive value. (p. MS-75)   
 
Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services 
In the CMS local coverage determination (LCD) “MolDX: Phenotype Biomarker Detection in 
Circulating Tumor Cells,” the following is included regarding CTC enumeration analysis: “CTC 
enumeration may be a good prognostic indicator for certain cancers, but studies do not conclusively 
suggest a clear effect on outcomes resulting from a change in management.”

Definitions of Decision Determinations 
 
Medically Necessary: Services that are Medically Necessary include only those which have been 
established as safe and effective, are furnished under generally accepted professional standards to 
treat illness, injury or medical condition, and which, as determined by Blue Shield, are: (a) consistent 
with Blue Shield medical policy; (b) consistent with the symptoms or diagnosis; (c) not furnished 
primarily for the convenience of the patient, the attending Physician or other provider; (d) furnished 
at the most appropriate level which can be provided safely and effectively to the patient; and (e) not 
more costly than an alternative service or sequence of services at least as likely to produce equivalent 
therapeutic or diagnostic results as to the diagnosis or treatment of the Member’s illness, injury, or 
disease. 
 
Investigational/Experimental:   A treatment, procedure, or drug is investigational when it has not 
been recognized as safe and effective for use in treating the particular condition in accordance with 
generally accepted professional medical standards. This includes services where approval by the 
federal or state governmental is required prior to use, but has not yet been granted.

Split Evaluation:   Blue Shield of California/Blue Shield of California Life & Health Insurance Company 
(Blue Shield) policy review can result in a split evaluation, where a treatment, procedure, or drug will 
be considered to be investigational for certain indications or conditions, but will be deemed safe and 
effective for other indications or conditions, and therefore potentially medically necessary in those 
instances. 
 
Prior Authorization Requirements and Feedback (as applicable to your plan) 
 
Within five days before the actual date of service, the provider must confirm with Blue Shield that the 
member's health plan coverage is still in effect. Blue Shield reserves the right to revoke an 
authorization prior to services being rendered based on cancellation of the member's eligibility. Final 
determination of benefits will be made after review of the claim for limitations or exclusions.  
 
Questions regarding the applicability of this policy should be directed to the Prior Authorization 
Department at   (800) 541-6652, or the Transplant Case Management Department at (800) 637-2066 
ext.    3507708 or visit the provider portal at www.blueshieldca.com/provider. 
 
We are interested in receiving feedback relative to developing, adopting, and reviewing criteria for 
medical policy. Any licensed practitioner who is contracted with Blue Shield of California or Blue 
Shield of California Promise Health Plan is welcome to provide comments, suggestions, or 
concerns.   Our internal policy committees will receive and take your comments into consideration. 
 
For utilization and medical policy feedback, please send comments to: MedPolicy@blueshieldca.com 
 
Disclaimer: This medical policy is a guide in evaluating the medical necessity of a particular service or treatment. 
Blue Shield of California may consider published peer-reviewed scientific literature, national guidelines, and local 
standards of practice in developing its medical policy. Federal and state law, as well as contract language, 
including definitions and specific contract provisions/exclusions, take precedence over medical policy and must 
be considered first in determining covered services. Member contracts may differ in their benefits. Blue Shield 
reserves the right to review and update policies as appropriate.
