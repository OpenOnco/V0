DESCRIPTION 
The standard for treatment selection in some cancers is biomarker analysis of tissue samples during 
biopsy or surgery. Both biopsy and surgery are invasive with slow turnaround time for obtaining 
results. Tumor tissue may also be heterogeneous which may result in patients receiving 
chemotherapy rather than targeted therapy. An alternative to tissue-based molecular testing is cell-
free DNA from plasma in the blood of patients with cancer. Cell-free DNA in blood is derived from 
nonmalignant and malignant cell DNA. The small DNA fragments released into the blood by tumor 
cells are referred to as circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA). Most ctDNA is derived from apoptotic and 
necrotic cells, either from the primary tumor, metastases or circulating tumor cells. Unlike apoptosis, 
necrosis is considered a pathologic process, generating larger DNA fragments due to an incomplete 
and random digestion of genomic DNA. The length or integrity of the circulating DNA can potentially

distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic origins. The ctDNA can be used for genomic 
characterization of the tumor and identification of the biomarkers of interest. Detection of ctDNA is 
challenging because cell-free DNA is diluted by nonmalignant circulating DNA and usually represents 
a small fraction (less than 1%) of total cell-free DNA. Therefore, methods up to 500 to 1000 times 
more sensitive than standard sequencing approaches (e.g., Sanger) are needed. Genetic testing of 
ctDNA can be targeted at specific genes or at commonly found, acquired, somatic variants 
(“hotspots”) that occur in specific cancers, which can impact therapy decisions. Panel testing for 
specific genetic variants that may impact therapy decision in many different cancers can also be 
performed. 
Cell-free DNA tests can identify patients with NSCLC who cannot undergo lung biopsy, for whom 
there is a net benefit of targeted therapy versus chemotherapy.  
SUPPORTIVE LITERATURE 
Randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing treatment selection based on tumor biomarkers with 
plasma biomarkers would potentially support evidence on clinical utility, as well as evidence on the 
ability of liquid biopsy to predict treatment response similar to, or better than, tissue biopsy. If the 
two tests are highly correlated, they are likely to stratify treatment response similarly overall. To 
understand the implications of “false-positive: and false-negative” liquid biopsies for outcomes, 
patients who have discordant results on liquid biopsy and standard tissue biopsy can be assessed for 
response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). A negative liquid biopsy for EGFR-sensitizing or -
resistance variants, and a positive tissue-based biopsy responding to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors 
(TKIs), would suggest that the tissue biopsy was correct, and the liquid biopsy results were truly 
false-negatives. A positive liquid biopsy, and a negative tissue biopsy for EGFR variants responding to 
EGFR TKIs, would suggest the positive liquid biopsy was correct, rather than false-positive. Clinical 
utility might alternatively be established, based on the assumption that tissue biomarkers are the 
standard by which treatment decisions are made; consequently, agreement between liquid and tissue 
biopsies would infer that treatment selection based on liquid or tissue biopsies is likely to yield similar 
outcomes. The use of liquid biopsy rather than a tissue biopsy would reduce the number of patients 
undergoing invasive tissue sampling and any accompanying complications. 
PROFESSIONAL GUIDELINE(S) 
The Association for Molecular Pathology and College of American Pathologists joint publication 
(Lockwood 2023) recommend the selection of targeted therapy should be based on genomic analysis 
data derived from recently biopsied tumor tissue and ctDNA analysis. Although tissue genomic 
analysis remains the standard practice, identification of targetable alterations using ctDNA analysis 
should also be considered. Optimization of ctDNA analysis will require the use of NGS gene panels 
similar to those used for tissue analysis and assessment of tumor mutational burden and other 
biomarkers associated with response to immunotherapy. 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
(NSCLC) (V.11.2024) state that cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used in lieu of 
tissue diagnosis. Studies have demonstrated that cell-free tumor DNA testing generally has very high 

 
Medical Policy: Circulating Tumor DNA for Management of Cancer (Liquid Biopsy) 
Policy Number: 2.02.56 
Page: 6   of 18  
Proprietary Information of Excellus BlueCross BlueShield 
specificity but significantly compromised sensitivity with up to a 30% false-negative rate. Standards 
for analytical performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have not been established, and in 
contrast to tissue-based testing, no guidelines exist regarding the recommended performance 
characteristics of this type of testing. Cell-free tumor DNA testing can identify alterations that are 
unrelated to a lesion of interest, for example, clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP). 
Use of cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing can be considered in specific clinical circumstances, 
most notably when a patient is medically unfit for invasive tissue sampling, there is insufficient tissue 
for molecular analysis, and a follow-up tissue-based analysis is planned if an oncogenic driver is not 
identified. The NCCN NSCLC Panel recommends assessing a minimum of the following potential 
genetic variants: ALK, BRAF, EGFR, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, METex14, NTRK1/2/3 gene fusions, RET, 
and ROS1 rearrangements. 
The NCCN guidelines for Cutaneous Melanoma (V.3.2024) state emerging molecular technologies for 
cutaneous melanoma diagnosis and prognostication indications include that BRAF or next-generation 
sequencing (NGS) for resected stage I-II cutaneous melanoma is not recommended unless it will 
inform clinical trial participation. BRAF mutation is recommended for patients with stage III at high 
risk for recurrence for whom future BRAF-directed therapy may be an option. For initial presentation 
with stage IV disease or clinical recurrence, obtain tissue to ascertain alterations in BRAF, and in the 
appropriate clinical setting, KIT from either biopsy of the metastasis (preferred) or archival material if 
the patient is being considered for targeted therapy. Broader genomic profiling (e.g., larger NGS 
panels, BRAF non-V600 mutations) is recommended if feasible, especially if the test results might 
guide future treatment decisions or eligibility for participation in a clinical trial. If BRAF single-gene 
testing was the initial test performed, and is negative, clinicians should strongly consider larger NGS 
panels to identify other potential genetic targets (e.g., KIT, BRAF non-V600). Molecular testing may 
be performed on tumor tissue, or if not available, on peripheral blood (liquid biopsy). Given the 
possibility of a false negative, a negative liquid biopsy should prompt tissue testing. 
BRAF and KIT mutations appear to be early genetic driver events in melanoma. Thus, repeat 
molecular testing upon recurrence or metastases is likely to be of low yield. Repeat testing following 
progression on targeted therapy (BRAF-  or KIT-directed therapy) does not appear to have clinical 
utility, since the mechanisms of resistance are diverse and do not have prognostic or therapeutic 
relevance. 
The NCCN guidelines for Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma (V.3.2024) recommend gene profiling of tumor 
tissue as clinically indicated for individuals with locally advanced/metastatic disease who ae 
candidates for anti-cancer therapy to identify uncommon mutations. Consider specifically testing for 
actionable somatic findings including, but not limited to fusions (ALK, NRG1, NTRK, ROS1, FGFR2, 
RET), mutations (BRAF, BRCA 1/2, KRAS, PALB2), amplifications (HER2), microsatellite instability 
(MSI), and/or mismatch repair (MMR) deficiency. Testing on tumor tissue is preferred; however, cell-
free DNA testing can be considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible. Testing may be performed 
if recurrence after resection if not previously performed.  
The NCCN guidelines for Colon Cancer (V.5.2024) have expanded recommendations regarding 
biomarker testing as the role of targeted therapy for treatment of advanced or metastatic colorectal 
cancer (mCRC) has become increasingly prominent. Currently, determination of tumor gene status for 

 
Medical Policy: Circulating Tumor DNA for Management of Cancer (Liquid Biopsy) 
Policy Number: 2.02.56 
Page: 7   of 18  
Proprietary Information of Excellus BlueCross BlueShield 
KRAS/NRAS and BRAF mutations, as well as HER2 amplifications and MSI/MMR status (if not 
previously done), are recommended for patients with mCRC. The testing can be performed on 
formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissue (preferred) or blood-based assay and may be carried out for 
individual genes or as part of an NGS panel, although no specific methodology is recommended. NGS 
panels have the advantage of being able to pick up rare and actionable genetic alterations, such as 
neurotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase (NTRK) fusions. Based on the limited data in the colorectal 
cancer population, the NCCN Panel does not currently recommend TMB biomarker testing, unless 
measured as part of a clinical trial. 
The NCCN guidelines for Ovarian Cancer/Fallopian Tube Cancer/ Primary Peritoneal Cancer 
(V.3.2024) state comprehensive tumor testing may not be necessary for certain patients in the 
upfront setting, specifically those with a germline mutation in BRCA1/2 or other homologous 
recombination/DNA repair pathway genes. Initially molecular analysis should include BRCA1/2 status, 
loss of heterozygosity, or homologous recombination status, in the absence of a germline BRCA 
mutation. However, some patients (such as those who lack a BRCA1/2 mutation or experience 
disease recurrence) may benefit from a more thorough tumor molecular analysis to inform additional 
targeted therapy options. In the recurrence setting, tumor molecular analysis is recommended to 
include, at a minimum, tests to identify potential benefit from targeted therapeutics that have tumor-
specific or tumor-agnostic benefit including, but not limited to, BRCA1/2, HR status, MSI, MMR, TMB, 
BRAF, FRα, RET, and NTRK if prior testing did not include these markers. Molecular analyses may be 
performed on circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA or liquid biopsy) when tissue-based analysis is not 
clinically feasible. Additional somatic tumor testing can be considered at the physician’s discretion to 
identify genetic alterations for which FDA-approved tumor-specific or tumor-agnostic targeted 
therapy options exist. These additional tests may be particularly useful for patients who recurrence 
therapy options are limited.  
The NCCN guidelines for prostate cancer (V.1.2025) for somatic tumor testing pre-test considerations 
include that tumor molecular and biomarker analysis may be used for treatment decision-making, 
including understanding eligibility for biomarker-directed treatments, genetic counseling, early use of 
platinum chemotherapy, and eligibility for clinical trials. Clinical trials may include established and/or 
candidate molecular biomarkers for eligibility. The panel strongly recommends a metastatic biopsy for 
his   tologic and molecular evaluation. When unsafe or unfeasible, plasma ctDNA assay is an option, 
preferably collected during biochemical (PSA) and/or radiographic progression in order to maximize 
diagnostic yield. Caution is needed when interpreting ctDNA-only evaluation due to potential 
interference from clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), which can result in a false-
positive biomarker signal.  
The NCCN guidelines for Breast Cancer (V.6.2024) state the clinical use of Circulating Tumor Cells 
(CTC) or circulating DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer is not yet included in the NCCN 
Guidelines for Breast Cancer for disease assessment and monitoring but for HR-positive/HER2-
negative breast cancer, assess for PIK3CA mutations with tumor or liquid biopsy to identify 
candidates for alpelisib plus fulvestrant. PIK3CA mutation testing can be done on tumor tissue or 
ctDNA in peripheral blood (liquid biopsy). If liquid biopsy is negative, tumor tissue testing is 
recommended.

In the American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists Joint Review of 
Circulating Tumor DNA Analysis in Patients with Cancer (Merker 2018), the authors concluded that 
current evidence suggests that the optimal specimen type for analysis of circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) in blood is plasma. Analytical validity must be established for any clinical ctDNA test and 
different ctDNA assays may not give the same results because of different assay performance 
characteristics, such as differing limits of detection. Most assays have insufficient evidence to 
demonstrate clinical validity, and most have no evidence of clinical utility. Well-designed clinical trials 
or equivalence studies are needed to demonstrate clinical utility for most assays. Evidence shows 
discordance in results between ctDNA assays and tumor tissue genotyping and supports the value of 
tumor tissue genotyping to confirm undetected ctDNA findings. For advanced cancer, the evidence 
indicates that more reliable test results occur when the ctDNA assay is performed at the time of 
disease progression and not when responding to prior therapy. There is evidence that positive 
findings from well-validated ctDNA assays may support initiation of a targeted therapy option where 
an assay for the relevant genomic marker has demonstrated clinical utility when performed in tissue. 
For monitoring therapy effectiveness, evidence of clinical validity is still emerging, and there is 
currently no evidence of clinical utility to suggest that ctDNA assays are useful in this context, outside 
of a clinical trial. For early-stage cancer, evidence of clinical validity is still emerging, and there is 
currently no evidence of clinical utility to suggest that ctDNA assays are useful at diagnosis or in the 
adjuvant setting after completing treatment, outside of a clinical trial. For cancer screening, there is 
no evidence of clinical validity and clinical utility to suggest that ctDNA assays are useful in this 
context, outside of a clinical trial. Given the rapid pace of research, re-evaluation of the literature will 
shortly be required, along with the development of tools and guidance for clinical practice. 
REGULATORY STATUS 
On August 7, 2020, the FDA approved the Guardant 360 CDx assay as a companion diagnostic 
comprehensive liquid biopsy for advanced solid tumors.  
On August 26, 2020, the FDA approved the FoundationOne Liquid CDx as a companion diagnostic 
test. If the test results are negative for certain mutations, reflexing to routine biopsy and tumor 
mutation status confirmed, using an FDA-approved tumor test should be performed.
