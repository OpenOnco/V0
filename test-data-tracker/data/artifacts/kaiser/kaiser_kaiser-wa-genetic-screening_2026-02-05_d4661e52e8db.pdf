• Autism spectrum disorder 
• Dysmorphic facial features 
• Abnormal growth not otherwise explained 
 
2) Chromosomal microarray testing (CPT 81228, 81229) 
may be considered medically necessary for patients 
undergoing invasive prenatal genetic testing (i.e., 
amniocentesis, chorionic villus sampling (CVS), or fetal 
tissue sampling), or a patient who has had recurrent (two 
or more) intrauterine fetal demise. Genetic counseling is 
required. Prior authorization is not required if done at 
Labcorp, Natera or Prevention but is required for all other 
vendors in advance of submitting a claim for payment. 
 
3) Chromosomal microarray testing may be considered 
medically necessary for testing of one or both parents 
when a chromosomal deletion or duplication has been 
identified in one or more of their offspring and: 
a. Parental testing is necessary to guide a 
reproductive decision, or 
b. Parental testing is necessary to determine the 
clinical significance of the chromosome 
abnormality found in the child, and 
c. The result is expected to directly affect clinical 
management of the child 
 
The following are not covered: 
Chromosomal microarray testing to confirm the diagnosis of a 
disorder or syndrome that is routinely diagnosed based on 
clinical evaluation alone.

MCG* A-0672: This is not covered per MCG*   
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) 
Whole exome sequencing (WES) is considered medically 
necessary for a phenotypically affected individual when ALL of 
the following criteria are met:  
 
1. Individual has been evaluated by a board-certified medical 
geneticist (MD) or other board-certified physician specialist 
with specific expertise in the conditions and relevant genes 
for which testing is being considered  
2. Results have the potential to directly impact clinical decision-
making and clinical outcome for the patient  
3. A genetic etiology is the most likely explanation for the 
phenotype as demonstrated by EITHER of the following:  
A. multiple abnormalities affecting unrelated organ systems 
OR 
B. TWO of the following criteria are met:  
a. abnormality affecting a single organ system  
b. significant intellectual disability, symptoms of a 
complex neurodevelopmental disorder (e.g. self-
injurious behavior, reverse sleep-wake cycles), or 
severe neuropsychiatric condition (e.g. 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette syndrome)  
c. family history strongly implicating a genetic etiology  
d. period of unexplained developmental regression 
(unrelated to autism or epilepsy)  
e. dysmorphic facial features 
f. abnormal growth not otherwise explained 
4. No other causative circumstances (e.g. environmental 
exposures, injury, infection) can explain symptoms  
5. Clinical presentation does not fit a well-described syndrome 
for which single-gene or targeted panel testing is available  
6. The differential diagnosis list and/or phenotype warrant 
testing of multiple genes and ONE of the following:  
a. WES is more practical than the separate single gene 
tests or panels that would be recommended based 
on the differential diagnosis  
b. WES results may preclude the need for multiple 
and/or invasive procedures, follow-up, or screening 
that would be recommended in the absence of 
testing 
 
All requests must be approved by a KP geneticist, regardless of 
whether they have seen the patient.

Preconception or prenatal carrier testing for spinal muscular 
atrophy (SMA) with analysis of the SMN1 gene (CPT code 
81329), as described by the American College of Medical 
Genetics (ACMG) and the American College of Obstetricians and 
Gynecologists (ACOG), is considered medically necessary for a 
prospective biologic parent with the capacity and intention to 
reproduce. Testing is covered once in a lifetime. 
 
Kaiser Permanente will cover carrier testing for SMA (CPT 81329) 
without prior authorization when performed at a Kaiser 
Permanente lab, Natera or Prevention. Prior authorization will still 
be required for SMA carrier testing at any other lab in advance of 
submitting a claim for payment. 
 
 
All other spinal muscular atrophy genetic testing: 
Medical necessity review will be required for all other indications 
for SMN1/SMN2 gene testing using MCG* KP-0659.

populations at risk for a particular genetic disorder. Genetic screening is only appropriate when the natural history 
of the disease is understood; the screening tests are valid and reliable; sensitivity, specificity, false-negative, and 
false-positive rates are acceptable; and effective therapy is available. A sufficient benefit must be derived from a 
screening program to justify its cost.

MammaPrint Test 
08/06/2007: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: In conclusion, the selection of the 70- predictor genes were based on analyses of tumors 
from patients < 55 years of age with lymph node negative cancer who do not represent all women with breast 
cancer. The test proved to perform well as an independent prediction tool among the selected women studied. This, 
however, does not necessarily indicate that it would predict treatment response. To date there are no published 
studies that show if modification of adjuvant therapy based on this test would improve disease free or overall 
survival. A large randomized controlled trial (Microarray for Node negative Disease may Avoid Chemotherapy 
[MINDACT]) that will evaluate the clinical utility of MammaPrint is underway. The trial will directly compare the use 
of prognostic information provided by the standard clinicopathological criteria vs. the MammaPrint test to decide 
whether to offer adjuvant chemotherapy to node-negative breast cancer patients. The MINDACT plans to 
prospectively include 6000 women and follow-them up for a long duration in order to determine 5-year disease free-
survival rate. 
Articles: The literature search revealed multiple articles on molecular and gene-expression profiling in general. For 
the MammaPrint test in particular, there was a published study on the training set (to develop or derive the 
predictive classifier or model) by Van’t Veer and colleagues, and three validation studies to evaluate the predictive 
accuracy of the model (Van De Vijver 2002, Buyse 2006, and Glas 2006). All studies were reviewed but only the 
first two validation studies were critically appraised, Glas, et al’s study was not selected for critical appraisal due to 
patient overlap with the van De Vijver study. It is to be noted that Van De Vijver, van’t Veer, and several other 
principal authors are named inventors on a patent application for the 70-gene signature used in the studies. All 
studies also had financial ties to the manufacturer. The following studies were critically appraised: 
Van De Vijver MJ, He YD, van’t Veer LJ, et al. A gene expression signature as a predictor of survival in breast 
cancer. N Engl J Med 2002:347:1999-2009. See Evidence Table. Buyse M, van’t Veer, L, Viale G et al on behalf of 
the TRANSBIG Consortium. Validation and clinical utility of a 70-gene prognostic signature for women with node 
negative breast cancer. J Natl Cancer Inst 2006:98:1183-1192. See Evidence Table. 
 
The use of the MammaPrint test in the treatment of recurring cancer does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical 
Technology Assessment Criteria. 
 
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) for the Genetic Evaluation of Patients with Intellectual 
Disability 
4/18/2011: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: Analytic validity The BCBS review identified several studies that evaluated the 
sensitivity of aCGH. The sensitivity of aCGH testing compared to conventional methods (karyotype and/or 
FISH) ranged from 73% to 100%. As false-positive rates were inconsistently reported, specificity could not be 
determined (BCBS 2009). Clinical validity 
Articles: No studies were identified that evaluated the impact of conventional methods or aCGH on patient 
outcomes other than diagnostic yield. Results from the BCBS review suggest that diagnostic yield in patients 
with intellectual disability ranged from 5 to 16.7%, which represents a significant improvement compared to 
conventional methods. The number needed to test by aCGH to detect one clinically relevant abnormality 
ranged from 25 to 6 depending on the diagnostic yield.  
 
The use of Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) for the genetic evaluation of patients 
with intellectual disability does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology Assessment 
Criteria. 
 
HLA Testing for Celiac Disease

cohort study evaluated the accuracy of serologic tests and HLA-DQ genotyping used alone and in combination 
for diagnosing celiac disease compared to small intestine biopsy. Results from this study suggest that both tTGA 
and EMA are sensitive and specific tests for diagnosing celiac disease. HLA-DQ testing was also highly sensitive 
but was not as specific as serologic testing. The addition of HLA-DQ genotyping to serum antibody tests did not 
increase test performance compared to serologic testing alone. Results should be interpreted with caution as 
only 16 patients were diagnosed with celiac disease (Hadithi 2007).  
Articles: Articles were selected for review if they included at least 25 subjects and assessed the accuracy of 
HLA genotyping compared to the small intestine biopsy. A prospective cohort study was selected for review. 
The following study was critically appraised: Hadithi M, von Blomberg ME, Crusius BA, et al. Accuracy of 
serologic tests and HLA-DQ typing for diagnosing celiac disease. Ann Intern Med 2007; 147:294-302. See 
Evidence Table 
 
The use of HLA testing for celiac disease does meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology Assessment 
Criteria. 
 
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) 
04/18/2011: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion:  
• Analytic validity: There is fair evidence that aCGH testing had good sensitivity compared to conventional 
methods; however, there is insufficient evidence to determine the specificity or reproducibility of this 
test. 
• Clinical validity: There is fair evidence that aCGH increases diagnostic yield over conventional methods; 
however, this is an intermediate outcome. 
• Clinical utility: There is insufficient evidence that patients managed with the genetic test had better 
outcomes than patients managed without the genetic test. 
Articles: In 2009, Blue Cross and Blue Shield (BCBS) evaluated the use of aCGH for the genetic evaluationof 
patients with developmental delay/ mental retardation. Studies were selected for review if they were published 
after the 2009 review and did not support the BCBS recommendations. No studies were identified that would 
change the BCBS recommendations. The following review was critically appraised: Blue Cross and Blue Shield 
Association. Special report: aCGH for the genetic evaluation of patients with developmental delay/mental 
retardation or autism spectrum disorder. Assessment Program. Volume 23, No. 10. April 2009. 
 
The use of Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) for the genetic evaluation of patients 
with intellectual disabilities does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology Assessment 
Criteria. 
 
Fibroblast Growth Factor Receptor 3 (FGFR3) for Urothelial Carcinoma 
10/17/2011: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: Analytic validity: No studies were identified that addressed the analytic validity of the 
CertNDx molecular grading assay. Clinical validity: Results from observational studies regarding the prognostic 
value of molecular grade (FGFR3/Ki-67) are mixed. Clinical utility: No studies were identified that addressed the 
clinical utility of the CertNDx molecular grading assay. 
Articles: No studies were identified that addressed the analytic validity or clinical utility of the CertNDx molecular 
grading assay. Several studies were identified that evaluated the clinical validity of the CertNDx molecular grading 
assay. The most recent study was selected for review. The following study was critically appraised: Burger M, van 
der Aa MN, van Oers JM, et al. Prediction of progression of non-muscle-invasive bladder cancer by WHO 1973 
and 2004 grading and by FGFR3 mutation status: a prospective study. Eur Urol. 2008;54:835-843. See Evidence

The use of FGFR3 for urothelial carcinoma does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology 
Assessment Criteria. 
 
OVA1™ Test for the Assessment of Suspected Ovarian Cancer 
10/17/2011: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: Analytic validity: No studies were identified that evaluated analytic validity of the OVA1™ 
test. Clinical validity: Results from a recent observational study suggest that the when added to physician 
assessment or substituted for CA 125, the OVA1™ test increased the sensitivity and negative predictive value of 
these assessments but decrease the specificity and positive predictive value. Clinical utility: No studies were 
identified that evaluated the clinical utility of the OVA1™ test.

BREVAGen  
12/16/2013: MTAC REVIEW  
Evidence Conclusion: There is no evidence to determine the analytic validity of the BREVAGen™. There is 
some evidence to suggest that the addition of the BREVAGen™ panel is superior in determining breast cancer 
risk compared to Gail score alone. There is no evidence to determine the clinical utility of the BREVAGen™. 
Articles: A search of PubMed was completed for the period through November 2013 for studies on the accuracy 
of BREVAGen™ for detecting the absence or presence of certain common genetic variations associated with an 
increased risk for developing breast cancer. The search strategy used the terms BREVAGen, Breast Cancer Risk 
Tool, Gail Model, genetic risk, single nucleotide polymorphism, breast cancer, and sporadic with variations. To 
identify ongoing clinical trials, a search of the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials website was also 
conducted using the same methodology. Articles were limited to those published in the English language with 
human subject enrollment. The search was supplemented by an examination of article reference lists in addition to 
the PubMed related articles function. The literature search for BREVAGen™ revealed one publication that 
clinically validates the Breast Cancer Risk Model in combination with the genetic and clinical information. The 
following study was selected for review: Mealiffe ME, Stokowski RP, Rhees BK, et al. Assessment of clinical 
validity of a breast cancer risk model combining genetic and clinical information. Journal of the National Cancer 
Institute. 2010;102(21):1618-1627. See Evidence Table. 
 
The use of BREVAGen does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology Assessment Criteria.

Ambry Genetics’ Next-Generation Panels (BreastNext, OvaNext, CancerNext) 
Evidence Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to determine the analytic validity, clinical validity or clinical 
utility of the Ambry’s Next-Gen Cancer Panels. 
Articles: A search of PubMed was completed for the period through August 2013 for studies on the accuracy of 
NGS for predicting risk of hereditary breast ovarian and colon cancer.  The search strategy used the terms next 
generation, cancer panel, BreastNext, breast cancer, ColoNext, colon cancer, OvaNext, ovarian cancer and 
CancerNext with variations. To identify ongoing clinical trials, a search of the National Institute of Health Clinical 
Trials website was also conducted using the same methodology. Articles were limited to those published in the 
English language with human subject enrollment. The search was supplemented by an examination of article 
bibliographies in addition to the PubMed related articles function.

Colon Cancer Panel 
10/16/2013: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence to determine the analytic validity, clinical utility and clinical 
validity of Coloseq™ for the identification of hereditary colon cancer. 
Articles: A search of PubMed was completed for the period from April 2012 to November 5
th
, 2013 for studies on 
the accuracy of ColoSeq™ for detecting hereditary colon cancer. The search strategy used the terms Coloseq™, 
genetic testing, Lynch syndrome, familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), MUTYH-associated polyposis, and colon 
cancer with variations. To identify ongoing clinical trials, a search of the National Institute of Health Clinical Trials 
website was also conducted using the same methodology. Selected articles were limited to those published in the 
English language enrolling human subjects. The search was supplemented by an examination of article reference 
lists in addition to the PubMed related articles function. Screening of articles: The literature search for ColoSeq™ 
revealed one July 2012 publication on the development and validity of the assay (Pritchard, Smith et al. 2012). Due 
to recent additions (October 2013) to the Coloseq™ cancer panel, this publication is no longer applicable and was 
not reviewed.

Thyroid Nodule Gene Expression Testing (Afirma) 
10/21/2013: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: In conclusion, there is insufficient evidence to determine whether Afirma GEC is more 
accurate than repeat FNA or immunochemical testing in reclassifying cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. 
There is also insufficient evidence to determine the impact of Afirma GEC on clinical management and net health 
outcomes in patients with indeterminate thyroid nodules. 
Articles: The literature search for gene expression classifier for preoperative identification of benign thyroid 
nodules with indeterminate fine needle aspiration cytopathology revealed a number of articles on molecular 
diagnostic tests. Many were reviews, editorials, letters, or were unrelated to the current review. The search 
identified a study on the analytic validity of the test, two on its clinical validity, and retrospective study on its clinical 
utility. The following studies were selected for critical appraisal. Alexander EK, Kennedy GC, Baloch ZW, et al. 
Preoperative diagnosis of benign thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology. N Engl J Med. 2012; 367:705-715.

04/20/2015: MTAC REVIEW 
DecisionDx - Melanoma 
Evidence Conclusion: There is limited evidence to conclude that the DecisionDx-Melanoma test is valid. There 
is insufficient evidence to conclude that the DecisionDx-Melanoma test has prognostic accuracy in predicting 
metastatic risk. There is insufficient evidence to conclude that the DecisionDx-Melanoma test is not harmful to 
patients. There is insufficient evidence to establish the clinical utility and therapeutic impact of the DecisionDx-
Melanoma test. 
Articles: The literature search was carried out to identify studies relating to the prognostic value of the 
DecisionDx-Melanoma test. The search revealed a variety of publications discussing the use of GEP and one 
publication identifying the genes associated with melanoma progression and prognosis (Winnepenninckx, Lazar et 
al. 2006). No studies were identified in which the DecisionDX-Melanoma was prospectively analyzed and followed- 
up in populations with Stage I and II melanoma. A search of the NIH Clinical Trials database identified two 
manufacturer sponsored prospective studies currently in the enrollment stage. The best, currently available, 
evidence was a development and validation study published by Castle Biosciences, Inc. The following articles 
were selected for critical appraisal: Gerami P, Cook RW, Wilkinson J, et al. Development of a prognostic genetic 
signature to predict the metastatic risk associated with cutaneous melanoma. Clinical Cancer Research. 
2015:21(1);175-183. See Evidence Table. 
 
The use of DecisionDx-Melanoma does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology Assessment Criteria. 
 
Whole Genome/Exome Sequencing for Developmental Delay (DD)/Intellectual Disability (ID) 
Date: 07/09/2018 MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: 
• Analytical validity: Studies assessing analytical validity were scarce. Only two studies reported that the 
performance of WES/WGS was high.  However, the evidence is insufficient to draw conclusion on analytical 
validity. 
• Clinical validity: Thirteen studies were evaluated. Most studies have included children with moderate to 
severe intellectual disability/developmental delay. In most studies, WES or WGS was performed in patients on 
whom previous genetic evaluations (molecular karyotyping, microarray) failed to diagnose the etiology or were 
negative. The diagnostic yield ranged from 21% to 60% (including new mutations) suggesting higher detection 
rate than traditional genetic tests including microarray. Nevertheless, the studies provide low evidence and 
demonstrate that WES/WGS has high detection rate overall and even in children with undiagnosed or 
unexplained intellectual disability or developmental delay. 
• Clinical utility: The evidence on clinical utility is conflicting. More studies are warranted.  
• Milliman Care Guidelines was reviewed and indicated that the evidence is poor, or conflicting, or insufficient to 
assess the net benefit of this test versus harm; additional research is recommended.

Chromosomal microarray for Intellectual Disability (ID)/ Developmental delay (DD) 
Date: 07/09/2018 MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: 
• Analytic validity: Four studies were reviewed and showed high sensitivity and specificity with high 
concordance in comparison to FISH or karyotyping. This suggests that chromosomal microarray can 
accurately detect copy number variants in children and adolescents with developmental delay or intellectual 
disability.  The studies were retrospective in design or case series resulting in low evidence.  
• Clinical validity: Nine studies (please refer to “other studies table” and table 2) in addition to those included in 
Milliman review (evidence table 1) were evaluated. In children and adolescents with unexplained 
developmental delay or intellectual disability, chromosomal microarray (aCGH) diagnosed genomic alterations 
that were not detected by conventional cytogenetic tests including karyotype or FISH. This suggests that the 
detection rate of chromosomal microarray is higher than conventional cytogenetic tests. However, the studies 
reviewed were case series or retrospective chart review resulting in low evidence. 
• Clinical utility: Two studies (please refer to “other studies table” and table 2) in addition to those included in 
Milliman review (evidence table 1) were evaluated. The clinical utility revolved around referrals to specialists, 
recommendation for screening of other anomalies, provision of recurrent risk for affected subsequent 
pregnancies, and avoidance of unnecessary testing. However, the studies were surveys and retrospective 
review with small sample size resulting in low evidence.  
• Milliman Care guidelines indicated that there is a net benefit in evaluating children and adolescents with 
intellectual disability with chromosomal microarray analysis (CMA). The use of CMA to detect copy number 
variants affects medical management and this includes referrals to specialists, treatment intervention for 
special findings, reduction of unnecessary procedures, and screening for associated anomalies. However, the 
evidence is of low certainty.  
 
The use of Chromosomal microarray for Intellectual Disability (ID)/ Developmental delay (DD) meets the Kaiser 
Permanente Medical Technology Assessment Criteria. 
 
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) - Broad Spectrum Tumor Molecular profiling 
01/14/2019: MTAC Review 
Evidence Conclusion:  
• As indicated earlier in the report, it is difficult to set standards for assuring the analytical validity of NGS tests 
due to the amount and complexity of cancer genome sequencing and the different NGS technologies used. In 
general, however, the published validation studies suggest that NGS tests may have a high analytic validity, 
and lower clinical validity.  
• There is insufficient evidence from published randomized clinical trials to determine that incorporating NGS 
into cancer care improves patient outcomes, such as treatment response and disease-free survival, or to 
support the use of molecularly targeted agents outside their indications based on tumor molecular profiling. 
• More RCTs are needed to provide evidence on the utility of cancer genomics in clinical practice. 
Articles: The literature search identified over 1,000 articles on NGS; the great majority of which were reviews, 
abstracts or articles not related to the current review. The search was filtered and narrowed down according 
the inclusion criteria based on PICO. Selected studies comparing the performance of NGS versus Sanger 
sequencing as well as randomized or nonrandomized studies evaluating the effectiveness and safety of 
applying the technology to cancer patients were included in the review. See Evidence Table 
 
The use of Broad-Spectrum Tumor Molecular Profiling - Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) does not meet the 
Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology Assessment Criteria. 
 
ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer  
07/11/2022: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: 
o Analytical validity: Very low-quality study shows that the assay can measure the methylation status of the three 
genes including GSTP1, APC, and RASSF1. 
o Clinical validity: Low quality evidence support ConfirmMDx in ruling out prostate cancer on repeat biopsy.  
o Clinical utility: There is insufficient evidence for or against the clinical utility of ConfirmMDx for prostate cancer.  
o Overall, the evidence is insufficient for or against the use of ConfirmMDx.

Assessment Criteria. 
 
Prolaris for Prostate Cancer 
07/11/2022: MTAC REVIEW 
Evidence Conclusion: 
➢ PROLARIS BIOPSY TEST 
• Low quality evidence shows that CCP testing is reproducible and precise.  
• Very low to low quality evidence indicate that CCP & CCR scores may help predict prostate cancer mortality 
and metastasis. It may help improve risk stratification in men with localized prostate cancer. 
• Low quality evidence shows that Prolaris test may influence physician treatment decision.  
• Overall, low quality evidence supports Prolaris test to predict prostate cancer related clinical outcomes.  
➢ PROLARIS POST-PROSTATECTOMY 
• The evidence is insufficient for or against the use of Prolaris test in patients with radical prostatectomy. 
Articles: PubMed was searched through April 11, 2022 with the search terms (Prolaris OR cell cycle progression 
OR CCP OR cell cycle risk OR CCR) AND (prostate) with variations. The search was limited to English language 
publications and human populations. The reference lists of relevant studies were reviewed to identify additional 
publications. See Evidence Table. 
 
The use of Prolaris Prostate Cancer (Biopsy and Post-Prostatectomy) does not meet the Kaiser Permanente 
Medical Technology Assessment Criteria. 
 
Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier 
10/10/2022: MTAC Review 
Evidence Conclusion: 
Decipher genomic testing using biopsy specimen 
• There is insufficient evidence for or against the analytical validity and clinical utility of Decipher test. Low 
quality evidence supports the clinical validity of Decipher test. Overall, the evidence is insufficient for or against 
the use of Decipher genomic testing using biopsy specimen.  
Decipher genomic testing using radical prostatectomy specimen 
• Analytical validity: There is a lack of studies.  
• Clinical validity: Low quality evidence from retrospective studies demonstrate that the Decipher Genomic 
Classifier is consistently superior in its prognostic and discriminatory ability in comparison to clinicopathologic 
variables for metastasis & prostate cancer-specific mortality. 
• Clinical utility: Low quality evidence supports the clinical utility of Decipher testing. Decipher may influence 
treatment recommendations change in post prostatectomy patients with adverse pathologic characteristics.  
• Overall, low quality evidence supports the use of Decipher genomic testing using radical prostatectomy 
specimens.  
Articles: PubMed was searched through September 2022 with the search terms (Decipher OR genomic classifier 
OR 22-gene) AND (prostate). The search was limited to English language publications and human populations. 
The reference lists of relevant studies were reviewed to identify additional publications. The search yielded several 
studies. See  Evidence Table. 
 
The use of Decipher Prostate Genomic Classifier does not meet the Kaiser Permanente Medical Technology 
Assessment Criteria. 
 
Hayes Review 
ConfirmMDx for Prostate Cancer (MDxHealth Inc.) 
According to the laboratory, ConfirmMDx is for men with a previous histopathologically cancer-negative prostate 
biopsy within the past 24 months who have clinicopathological risk factors for prostate cancer to (MDxHealth, 2017; 
MDxHealth, 2018a): 
• Identify men at risk for undetected prostate cancer (a false-negative biopsy result).

• Rule out men who are prostate cancer free to prevent unnecessary repeat biopsies and screening procedures, 
resulting in reduced complications, patient anxiety, and healthcare expenses. 
In addition, the ConfirmMDx test result claims to predict the likelihood of (MDxHealth, 2017): 
• Detecting Gleason score ≤ 6 prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. 
• Detecting Gleason score ≥ 7 prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. 
Hayes Rating: D2  
For use of ConfirmMDx test, using residual prostate biopsy specimens, to: (1) rule out men who are prostate cancer 
free; and (2) identify men at risk for undetected prostate cancer by predicting the likelihood of detecting Gleason 
score ≤ 6 and ≥ 7 prostate cancer on repeat biopsy in men with an initial negative biopsy yet high-risk 
clinicopathological features suggestive of prostate cancer. 
Conclusion: There is positive but insufficient evidence supporting the use of the ConfirmMDx test to help rule-out 
prostate cancer in repeat biopsy and insufficient evidence for the use of the test to predict the likelihood of Gleason 
score ≤ 6 prostate cancer and Gleason score ≥ 7 prostate cancer on repeat biopsy. Available studies do not 
evaluate whether the test results, when used to influence patient repeat biopsy decisions, result in improved patient 
outcomes in men with high-risk clinicopathological features suggestive of prostate cancer.

SelectMDx for Prostate Cancer (MDxHealth Inc.) 
 According to the testing laboratory, the SelectMDx test is a noninvasive, urine-based molecular screening test that, 
when combined with patient clinical risk factors, can aid physicians in determining if a patient is at higher risk 
(defined by laboratory as detecting GS ≥ 7 prostate cancer upon biopsy) or lower risk for prostate cancer and can 
avoid biopsy (MDxHealth, 2019a). The test is intended for men who have not been previously diagnosed with 
prostate cancer. The SelectMDx test requires a first void post-digital rectal examination (DRE) urine sample, which 
is analyzed for the mRNA level of 2 cancer-related biomarkers, DLX1 and HOXC6 (MDxHealth, 2016; MDxHealth, 
2019b). 
 
 Hayes Rating: D2 
For use of the SelectMDx for Prostate Cancer test to aid physicians in determining if a patient is at higher risk 
(defined by laboratory as detecting Gleason score (GS) ≥ 7 prostate cancer upon biopsy) or lower risk for prostate 
cancer and can avoid biopsy. 
 
Conclusion: There is insufficient evidence supporting use of the SelectMDx test. Additional studies are needed to 
demonstrate the clinical validity and, ultimately, clinical utility of the test and whether the test results would improve 
patient management outcomes, including avoiding unnecessary prostate biopsies.
