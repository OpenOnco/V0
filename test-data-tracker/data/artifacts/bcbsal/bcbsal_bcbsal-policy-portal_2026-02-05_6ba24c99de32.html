Policies and Guidelines

 

Use the navigation on the left to locate specific policy information.

Medical policies are based on the most current medical research available at the time of the policy development.  Medical policies are based on constantly changing medical science and the Plan reserves the right to review and update our policies as necessary.

We encourage practicing physicians to provide input related to developing, adopting and reviewing criteria for medical policy. Any licensed practitioner is welcome to provide comments, suggestions or concerns. Our internal policy committee will review and take your comments into consideration. For medical policy feedback, email comments to mpc@bcbsal.org.
