Plasma-based comprehensive somatic genomic profiling testing (CGP) using Guardant360® for patients 
with Stage IIIB/IV non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is considered MEDICALLY NECESSARY when 
the following criteria have been met: 
 
Diagnosis:  
• When tissue-based CGP is infeasible (i.e., quantity not sufficient for tissue-based CGP or invasive 
biopsy is medically contraindicated), AND 
• When prior results for ALL of the following tests are not available: 
o EGFR single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and insertions and deletions (indels)  
o ALK and ROS1 rearrangements  
o PDL1 expression.  
 
Progression:  
• Patients progressing on or after chemotherapy or immunotherapy who have never been tested for 
EGFR SNVs and indels, and ALK and ROS1 rearrangements, and for whom tissue-based CGP is 
infeasible (i.e., quantity not sufficient for tissue-based CGP), OR 
• For patients progressing on EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). 
 
If no genetic alteration is detected by Guardant360®, or if circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is 
insufficient/not detected, tissue-based genotyping should be considered. 
 
Other plasma-based CGP tests are considered INVESTIGATIONAL. 
  
CGP and the use of circulating tumor DNA is considered INVESTIGATIONAL for all other indications.

Description 
Liquid biopsy refers to analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as a 
method of noninvasively characterizing tumors and tumor genome from the peripheral blood. 
 
Circulating Tumor DNA 
Normal and tumor cells release small fragments of DNA into the blood, which is referred to as cell-free 
DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA from nonmalignant cells is released by apoptosis. Most cell-free tumor DNA is 
derived from apoptotic and/or necrotic tumor cells, either from the primary tumor, metastases, or CTCs. 
Unlike apoptosis, necrosis is considered a pathologic process, and generates larger DNA fragments due 
to an incomplete and random digestion of genomic DNA. The length or integrity of the circulating DNA 
can potentially distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic origin. ctDNA can be used for genomic 
characterization of the tumor. 
 
Circulating Tumor Cells 
Intact CTCs are released from a primary tumor and/or a metastatic site into the bloodstream. The half-life 
of a CTC in the bloodstream is short (1-2 hours), and CTCs are cleared through extravasation into 
secondary organs. Most assays detect CTCs through the use of surface epithelial markers such as 
EpCAM and cytokeratins. The primary reason for in detecting CTCs is prognostic, through quantification 
of circulating levels. 
Technologies for Detecting ctDNA and CTCs 
Detection of ctDNA is challenging because ctDNA is diluted by nonmalignant circulating DNA and usually 
represents a small fraction (<1%) of total cfDNA. Therefore, more sensitive methods than the standard 
sequencing approaches (eg, Sanger sequencing) are needed. 
 
Highly sensitive and specific methods have been developed to detect ctDNA, for both single-nucleotide 
mutations (eg BEAMing [which combines emulsion polymerase chain reaction [PCR] with magnetic beads 
and flow cytometry] and digital PCR) and copy-number changes. Digital genomic technologies allow for 
enumeration of rare mutant variants in complex mixtures of DNA. 
 
Approaches to detecting ctDNA can be considered targeted, which h includes the analysis of known 
genetic mutations from the primary tumor in a small set of frequently occurring driver mutations, which 
can impact therapy decisions (eg, EGFR and ALK in non-small-cell lung cancer), or untargeted without 
knowledge of specific mutations present in the primary tumor, and include array comparative genomic 
hybridization, next-generation sequencing, and whole exome and genome sequencing. 
 
CTC assays usually start with an enrichment step that increases the concentration of CTCs, either on the 
basis of biologic properties (expression of protein markers) or physical properties (size, density, electric 
charge). CTCs can then be detected using immunologic, molecular, or functional assays. 
 
Summary 
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood, referred to as 
“liquid biopsy,” potentially offer a noninvasive alternative to tissue biopsy for therapeutic decisions and 
clinical prognosis in patients with cancer.  
 
For individuals who have cancer who receive molecular characterization of tumor using ctDNA, the 
evidence includes case series and systematic reviews of these case series. Relevant outcomes are 
overall survival, disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication use. 
Ultrasensitive methods to detect mutations from ctDNA have been developed, but there is limited 
evidence on the analytic validity of these methods. There is a need for further optimization and 
standardization of testing methods. Clinical validity consists of case series that report correlations 
between mutations detected in ctDNA with mutations detected in tumor tissue. Results have shown 
variable results for clinical sensitivity. Although some reports have suggested that clinical sensitivity may 

 
4 
 
be high, this finding has not been consistent. Published studies have consistently reported high clinical 
specificity; however, most study populations are small and heterogeneous, and it is not known to what 
degree mutations detected by ctDNA are representative of the primary tumor. Published studies reporting 
clinical outcomes and/or clinical utility are lacking. However, specifically for ctDNA in non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC), the evidence supports improved health outcomes at tumor progression and at diagnosis 
if tissue sample is unobtainable.    
 
For individuals who have cancer or are at high risk of developing cancer who receive identification and 
quantification of CTCs, the evidence includes case series and meta-analyses of these case series. 
Relevant outcomes are overall survival, disease-specific survival, and test accuracy and test validity. 
 
Published data on analytic validity are lacking. Most of the literature consists of reports of levels of CTCs 
and cancer prognosis, and have shown a correlation with survival in certain cancer types. However, the 
cutoff levels that should be used to signal a change in patient management are unknown, and there are 
no studies showing clinical utility and improved patient outcomes. The evidence is insufficient to 
determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. If a separate evidence review exists, then 
conclusions reached there supersede conclusions in this review.
