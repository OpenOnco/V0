Description 
 
 
Comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) (also referred to as comprehensive molecular profiling) is a type of 
somatic (tumor) test that involves a combination of laboratory methodologies to detect genetic alterations 
and the simultaneous evaluation of large numbers (hundreds to thousands) of biomarkers in tumor tissue 
to aid in the management of advanced solid tumors, including guiding treatment decisions as well as 
determination of clinical trial eligibility. Techniques can vary from test to test and may include next-
generation sequencing (NGS), fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and immunohistochemistry (IHC) and 
often provides information on tumor mutational burden (TMB), microsatellite instability (MSI) and 
homologous recombination deficiency (HRD). Examples include Altera Tumor Genomic Profiling, 
Guardant360, NeoGenomics Solid Tumor NGS Fusion Panel and TissueNext.

Some CGP tests analyze both deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and ribonucleic acid (RNA). NeoTYPE DNA & RNA 
– Lung is an NGS profiling test that detects single nucleotide variants, insertions/deletions, copy number 
variants, and/or RNA fusions in a total of 50 genes (44 genes analyzed by DNA and 19 by RNA), plus MSI and 
TMB. Tempus xT is another example of a CGP somatic test performed for the management of advanced 
cancer. Previously Tempus xT conducted sequencing for both ribonucleic acid (RNA) and deoxyribonucleic 
acid (DNA) within a single panel. However, a new test, Tempus xR, is now available as an independent assay 
dedicated solely to RNA sequencing. This means that Tempus xT focuses on DNA analysis while Tempus xR 
specializes in RNA analysis, and they are no longer combined into one test.  
 
Single gene testing can be utilized to diagnose and monitor cancer including, but may not be limited to, 
cholangiocarcinoma, gallbladder cancer, gastrointestinal stromal tumor, glioblastoma, melanoma and 
thyroid cancer. This type of testing is indicated for an individual who exhibits disease symptoms and may be 
necessary to diagnose or rule out suspected cancer.  
  
DNA Specimen Provenance Assignment (DSPA) Testing (eg, know error System) is a molecular diagnostic 
test intended for the protection and control of tissue samples to purportedly decrease the incidence of 
diagnostic mistakes due to the misidentification, specimen transposition or cell contamination of samples, 
also known as specimen provenance complications (SPCs). Breast and prostate tissues are most often 
tested but other tissue types, such as bone marrow, may also be examined. 
 
LungOI is an artificial-intelligence (AI)-based molecular profiling that uses a digitized biopsy image and is 
proposed for the diagnosis of lung cancer. (Refer to Coverage Limitations section) 
 
Genomic profiling in conjunction with in vitro chemoresistance and chemosensitivity assays has been 
proposed to guide treatment decisions. (Refer to Coverage Limitations section)
