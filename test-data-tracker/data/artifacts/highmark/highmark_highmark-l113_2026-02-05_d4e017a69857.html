Medical_Policy_Bulletin Highmark Commercial Medical Policy - Pennsylvania Medical Policy: L-113-009 Topic: Investigational and Experimental Molecular/Genomic Testing Section: Laboratory Effective Date: July 1, 2018 Issue Date: July 2, 2018 Last Reviewed: March 2018 Molecular and genomic (MolGen) tests are routinely released to market that make use of novel technologies or have a novel clinical application. These tests are often available on a clinical basis long before the evidence base required to support clinical validity and utility is established. Because these tests are often proprietary, there may be no independent test evaluation data available in the early stages to support the laboratory's claims regarding test performance and utility. An experimental or investigational procedure is generally defined as the use of a service, supply, drug or device that is not recognized as standard medical care for the condition, disease, illness or injury being treated as determined by the health plan based on independent review of peer reviewed literature and scientific data. Investigational and experimental (I&E) MolGen tests refer to assays involving chromosomes, DNA, RNA, or gene products that have insufficient data to determine the net health impact, which typically means there is insufficient data to support that a test accurately assesses the outcome of interest (analytical and clinical validity), significantly improves health outcomes (clinical utility), and/or performs better than an existing standard of care medical management option. Such tests are also not generally accepted as standard of care in the evaluation or management of a particular condition. In the case of MolGen testing, FDA clearance is not a reliable standard given the number of laboratory developed tests that currently fall outside of FDA oversight and FDA clearance often does not assess clinical utility. This policy is designed to address medical guidelines that are appropriate for the majority of individuals with a particular disease, illness, or condition. Each person's unique clinical circumstances may warrant individual consideration, based on review of applicable medical records. Policy Position Coverage is subject to the specific terms of the member’s benefit plan. Molecular and genomic tests are only eligible for reimbursement when ALL of the following conditions are met: Technical and clinical validity: The test must be accurate, sensitive and specific, based on sufficient, quality scientific evidence to support the claims of the test; and Clinical utility: Healthcare providers can use the test results to provide significantly better medical care for the individual; and Reasonable use: The usefulness of the test is not significantly offset by negative factors, such as expense, clinical risk, or social or ethical challenges.

Some tests under a single code may be covered while others are determined to be experimental/investigational. Place of Service: Outpatient Experimental/Investigational (E/I) services are not covered regardless of place of service. Experimental/investigational Molecular/Genomic Testing is typically an outpatient procedure which is only eligible for coverage as an inpatient procedure in special circumstances, including, but not limited to, the presence of a co-morbid condition that would require monitoring in a more controlled environment such as the inpatient setting. The policy position applies to all commercial lines of business Denial Statements Services that do not meet the criteria of this policy will be considered experimental/investigational (E/I). A network provider can bill the member for the experimental/investigational service. The provider must give advance written notice informing the member that the service has been deemed E/I. The member must be provided with an estimate of the cost and the member must agree in writing to assume financial responsibility in advance of receiving the service. The signed agreement must be maintained in the provider’s records.
