Title: Genetic Cancer Susceptibility Panels Using Next 
Generation Sequencing  
 
 
Description 
 
Commercially available cancer susceptibility gene panels can test multiple variants associated 
with a specific type of cancer or can include variants associated with a wide variety of cancers. 
Some of these variants are associated with inherited cancer syndromes. The cancer type(s), as 
well as a cancer history involving multiple family members, increase clinical concern for the 
presence of a heritable genetic variant. It has been proposed that variant testing using next-
generation sequencing (NGS) technology to analyze multiple genes at once (panel testing) can 
optimize genetic testing in these individuals compared with sequencing single genes. 
 
 
Medical Policy Statement 
 
Limited genetic cancer susceptibility panels that include only gene variants for which the 
member meets criteria in other policies may are established (see related policies in the 
Inclusionary and Exclusionary Guidelines). 
 
Genetic cancer susceptibility panel testing is considered experimental/investigational in all 
other situations.

Background 
 
Genetic testing for cancer susceptibility may be approached by a focused method that involves 
testing for gene(s) that may be the cause of heritable or familial cancer. Panel testing with next 
generation sequencing involves evaluating sequence variants in multiple genes at once. 
 
Multiple commercial companies and medical center laboratories offer genetic testing panels 
that use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods for hereditary cancers. NGS is one of 
several methods that use massively parallel platforms to allow the sequencing of large 
stretches of DNA. Panel testing is potentially associated with greater efficiencies in the 

 
 
3 
evaluation of genetic diseases; however, it may provide information on genetic variants of 
uncertain clinical significance or findings that would not lead to changes in patient 
management. 
 
Genes included in NGS Panels 
The following is a summary of the function and disease association of major genes included in 
the next generation sequencing panels. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list of all 
genes included in all panels. 
 
APC germline variants are associated with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) and 
attenuated FAP. FAP is an autosomal dominant colon cancer predisposition syndrome 
characterized by hundreds to thousands of colorectal adenomatous polyps, and accounts for 
~1% of all colorectal cancers. 
 
ATM is associated with the autosomal recessive condition ataxia-telangiectasia. This condition 
is characterized by progressive cerebellar ataxia with onset between the ages of 1 and 4 
years, telangiectasias of the conjunctivae, oculomotor apraxia, immune defects, and cancer 
predisposition, particularly leukemia and lymphoma. 
 
AXIN2 variants have been associated with familial adenomatous polyposis syndrome, 
although the phenotypes associated with AXIN2 variants do not appear to be well 
characterized. 
 
BARD1, BRIP1, MRE11A, NBN, RAD50, and RAD51C are genes in the Fanconi anemia-
BRCA pathway. Variants in these genes are estimated to confer up to a 4-fold increase in the 
risk for breast cancer. This pathway is also associated with a higher risk of ovarian cancer and, 
less often, pancreatic cancer. 
 
BMPR1A and SMAD4 are genes mutated in juvenile polyposis syndrome (JPS) and account 
for 45-60% of cases of JPS. JPS is an autosomal dominant disorder that predisposes to the 
development of polyps in the gastrointestinal tract. Malignant transformation can occur, and 
the risk of gastrointestinal cancer has been estimated from 9-50%. 
 
BRCA1 and BRCA2 germline variants are associated with hereditary breast and ovarian 
cancer syndrome, which is associated most strongly with increased susceptibility to breast 
cancer at an early age, bilateral breast cancer, male breast cancer, ovarian cancer, cancer of 
the fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer. BRCA1 and BCRA2 variants are also 
associated with increased risk of other cancers, including prostate cancer, pancreatic cancer, 
gastrointestinal cancers, melanoma, and laryngeal cancer.  
 
CDH1  is a tumor suppressing gene located on chromosome 16q22.1 that encodes the cell-to-
cell adhesion protein E-cadherin. Germline variants in the CDH1 gene have been associated 
with an increased risk of developing hereditary diffuse gastric cancer (DGC) and lobular breast 
cancer. A diagnosis of HDGC can be confirmed by genetic testing, although 20% to 40% of 
families with suspected HDGC do not have a CDH1 variant on genetic testing. Pathogenic 
CDH1 variants have been described in Māori families in New Zealand, and individuals of Maori 
ethnicity have a higher prevalence of diffuse-type gastric cancer than non-Maori New 
Zealanders. The estimated cumulative risk of gastric cancer for CDH1 variant carriers by age 

 
 
4 
80 years is 70% for men and 56% for women. CDH1 variants are associated with a lifetime risk 
of 39% to 52% of lobular breast cancer. 
 
CDK4 (cyclin-dependent kinase-4) is a protein-serine kinase involved in cell cycle regulation. 
Variants in this gene have been associated with a variety of cancers, particularly cutaneous 
melanoma.  
 
CDKN2A (cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 2A) encodes proteins that act as multiple tumor 
suppressors through their involvement in two cell cycle regulatory pathways: the p53 pathway 
and the RB1 pathway. Variants or deletions in CDKN2A are frequently found in multiple types 
of tumor cells. Germline variants in CDKN2A have been associated with risk of melanoma, 
along with pancreatic and central nervous system cancers. 
 
CHEK1 gene variants have been shown to be over expressed in a numerous tumors including 
breast, colon, liver, gastric and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
 
CHEK2 gene variants confer an increased risk of developing several different types of cancer, 
including breast, prostate, colon, thyroid and kidney. 
 
EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6 and PMS2 are mismatch repair genes associated with Lynch 
syndrome (hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer or HNPCC). Lynch syndrome is estimated to 
cause 2-5% of all colon cancers. Lynch syndrome is associated with a significantly increased 
risk of several types of cancer—colon cancer (60-80% lifetime risk), uterine/endometrial cancer 
(20-60% lifetime risk), gastric cancer (11-19% lifetime risk) and ovarian cancer (4-13% lifetime 
risk). The risk of other types of cancer, including small intestine, hepatobiliary tract, upper 
urinary tract and brain, are also elevated. 
 
FANCC (Fanconi-anemia complementation group C) is one of several DNA repair genes that 
are mutated in Fanconi anemia, which is characterized by bone marrow failure and a high 
predisposition to multiple types of cancer. 
 
FH (fumarate hydratase) variants have been associated with renal cell and uterine cancers.  
 
FLCN (folliculin) acts as a tumor suppressor gene; variants in this gene are associated with the 
autosomal dominant syndrome Birt-Hogg-Dube syndrome, which is characterized by hair 
follicle hamartomas, kidney tumors, and colorectal cancer.  
 
MET is a proto-oncogene that acts as the hepatocyte growth factor receptor. MET variants are 
associated with hepatocellular carcinoma and papillary renal cell carcinoma. 
 
MITF (microphthalmia-associated transcription factor) is a transcription factor involved in 
melanocyte differentiation. MITF variants lead to several auditory-pigmentary syndromes, 
including Waardenburg syndrome Type 2 and Tietz syndrome. MITF variants are also 
associated with melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. 
 
MUTYH- germline variants are associated with an autosomal recessive form of hereditary 
polyposis. It has been reported that 33% and 57% of patients with clinical FAP and attenuated 
FAP, respectively, who are negative for variants in the APC gene, have MUTYH variants. 
 

 
 
5 
NF1 (neurofibromin 1) encodes a negative regulator in the ras signal transduction pathway. 
Variants in the NF1 gene have been associated with neurofibromatosis Type 1, juvenile 
myelomonocytic leukemia, and Watson syndrome. 
 
PALB2 germline variants have been associated with an increased risk of pancreatic and 
breast cancer. Familial pancreatic and/or breast cancer due to PALB2 variants is inherited in 
an autosomal dominant pattern. 
 
PTEN variants have been associated with PTEN hamartoma tumor syndrome, which includes 
Cowden syndrome (CS), Bannayan-Riley-Ruvalcaba syndrome and Proteus syndrome. CS is 
characterized by a high risk of developing tumors of the thyroid, breast and endometrium. 
Affected individuals have a lifetime risk of up to 50% for breast cancer, 10% for thyroid cancer 
and 5-10% for endometrial cancer. 
 
RAD51D – (RAD51 paralog D) - germline variants have been associated with familial breast 
and ovarian cancer. 
 
RET encodes a receptor tyrosine kinase; variants in this gene have been associated with 
multiple endocrine neoplasia syndromes (types IIA and IIB) and medullary thyroid carcinoma.  
 
SDHA, SDHB, SDHC, SDHD, and SDHAF2 gene products are involved in the assembly and 
function of one component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Germline variants in these 
genes have been associated with the development of paragangliomas, pheochromocytomas, 
gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and a PTEN-negative Cowden syndrome (Cowden-like 
syndrome). 
  
STK11 germline variants have been associated with Peutz-Jegher syndrome (PJS), an 
autosomal dominant disorder, with a 57-81% risk of developing cancer by age 70, of which 
gastrointestinal and breast are the most common. 
 
TMEM127 (transmembrane protein 127) germline variants have associated with risk of 
pheochromocytomas.  
 
TP53 has been associated with Li-Fraumeni syndrome. Individuals with TP53 variants have a 
50% risk of developing any of the associated cancers by age 30 and a lifetime risk up to 90%, 
including sarcomas, breast cancer, brain tumors and adrenal gland cancer. 
 
TSC1 (tuberous sclerosis 1) and TSC2 (tuberous sclerosis 2) encode the proteins hamartin 
and tuberin, which are involved in cell growth, differentiation, and proliferation. Variants in 
these genes are associated with the development of tuberous sclerosis complex, an autosomal 
dominant syndrome characterized by skin abnormalities, developmental delay, seizures, and 
multiple types of cancers, including central nervous system tumors, renal tumors (including 
angiomyolipomas, renal cell carcinomas), and cardiac rhabdomyomas. 
 
VHL germline variants are associated with the autosomal dominant familial cancer syndrome 
Von Hippel-Lindau syndrome, which is associated with a variety of malignant and benign 
tumors, including central nervous system tumors, renal cancers, pheochromocytomas, and 
pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. 
 

 
 
6 
XRCC2 encodes proteins thought to be related to the RAD51 protein product that is involved in 
DNA double-stranded breaks. Variants may be associated with Fanconi anemia and breast 
cancer. 
 
 
 
SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE 
 
For individuals who have a personal and/or family history suggesting an inherited cancer 
syndrome who receive testing with a next-generation sequencing panel, the evidence includes   
reports describing the diagnostic yield of expanded gene panels. Relevant outcomes are 
overall survival, disease-specific survival, test accuracy, and test validity. Studies of gene 
panel testing for genetic cancer risk assessment have reported primarily on the frequency with 
which variants are identified. The rates of variants of uncertain significant for gene panels are 
significant and increase in proportion with panel size, reaching nearly 50% for large gene 
panels. Published data on clinical utility is lacking, and it is unknown whether use of these 
panels improves health outcomes. Variants included in these panels are associated with 
varying levels of risk of developing cancer. Only some variants included on panels are 
associated with a high risk of developing a well-defined cancer syndrome for which there are 
established clinical management guidelines. Many panels include genetic variants that are 
considered to be of moderate or low penetrance, and clinical management recommendations 
for these genes are not well-defined. In addition, high rates of variants of uncertain significance 
have been reported with these panels, leading to the potential for harm. The evidence is 
insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. 
 
 
 
Rationale 
 
Evidence reviews assess clinical evidence to determine whether the use of a technology 
improves the net health outcome. Broadly defined, health outcomes are length of life, quality of 
life, and ability to function including benefits and harms. Every clinical condition has specific 
outcomes that are important to patients and to managing the course of that condition. 
Validated outcome measures are necessary to ascertain whether a condition improves or 
worsens; and whether the magnitude of that change is clinically significant. The net health 
outcome is a balance of benefits and harms. The following is a summary of the key literature to 
date. 
 
Expanded Cancer Susceptibility Panels 
 
Review of Evidence  
 
Hereditary Cancer Panels 
The likelihood that someone with a positive test result will develop cancer is affected not only 
by the presence of the gene variant, but also by other modifying factors that can affect the 
penetrance of the variant (e.g., environmental exposures, personal behaviors) or by the 
presence or absence of variants in other genes. 
 

 
 
7 
In 2016, Susswein et al reviewed the genetic test results and clinical data from a consecutive 
series of 10,030 patients referred for evaluation by one of 8 hereditary cancer panels 
(comprising combinations of 29 genes) between August 2013 and October 2014.
1
 Personal 
and family histories of cancer were obtained, and patients were categorized as having breast, 
colon, stomach, ovarian, endometrial, or pancreatic cancer; other cancer types were not 
singled out for analysis.  Genetic variants were classified as pathogenic, likely pathogenic, 
variants of uncertain significance (VUS), likely benign, or benign or variants according to the 
2007 guidelines from the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics.
2
 
 
Genes included in the panels were grouped into 3 risk categories based on penetrance data 
available in 2012, as follows:  
• high risk: APC, BMPR1A, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CDKN2A, EPCAM, MLH1, MSH2, 
MSH6, MUTYH, PMS2, PTEN, SMAD4, STK11, TP53, and VHL;  
• moderate risk: ATM, CHEK2, and PALB2; and  
• increased but less well-defined risk: AXIN2, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK4, FANCC, NBN, 
RAD51C, RAD51D, and XRCC2.   
 
Overall, 9.0% (901/10,030) of the patients were found to carry at least one pathogenic or likely 
pathogenic variant, totaling 937 variants. Approximately half of the positive results were in well-
established genes (including BRCA1 and BRCA2, Lynch syndrome, and other high-risk genes) 
and approximately half in genes with moderate or unknown risk. Likely pathogenic variants 
comprised 10.6% (99/937) of all positive results.   
 
Individuals with colon/stomach cancer had the highest yield of positive results (14.8% 
[113/764]), the majority of which were in well-established colon cancer genes: MLH1, MSH2, 
MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, MUTYH, APC, PTEN, and STK11. However, 28.2% (35/124) were 
observed in genes not considered classical for gastrointestinal cancers: BRCA1, BRCA2, 
CHEK2, ATM, PALB2, BRIP1, and RAD51D.   
 
For the breast cancer high-risk panels, the highest VUS frequency was observed with the 
largest panel (29 genes), and the lowest VUS rate was observed with the high-risk breast 
cancer panel with 6 genes. For patients with breast cancer, 9.7% (320/3315) of female patients 
without prior BRCA1 and BRCA2 testing were found to carry a pathogenic or likely pathogenic 
variant, of which BRCA1 and BRCA2 accounted for 39.1%, other high-risk genes (including 
TP53, PTEN, and CDH1) 5.8% (19/330), and 5.2% (17/330) in the Lynch syndrome genes. 
Moderate and less well-defined risk genes accounted for 50.0% (165/330) of all positive results 
among women with breast cancer.  
 
Of women with ovarian cancer,  BRCA1 and BRCA2 and accounted for 50.5%, Lynch 
syndrome genes for 14.3%, and moderate or less well-defined risk genes for 33.0%.  
 
Of the 453 women with endometrial cancer, the yield for identifying a variant was 11.9% 
(n=54); 7.3% (n=33) of these were within a Lynch gene, most commonly MSH6, CHEK2 was 
positive in 7%, with an overall frequency of 1.5%, and 6 positive results were identified in 
BRCA1 and BRCA2; 10.9% (6/55) of all positive variants identified.  
 
Among 190 pancreatic cancer patients, the yield for identifying a variant was 10.5% (n=20), 
most commonly identified in ATM (40.0% [8/20]), BRCA2 (25.0% [5/20]), and PALB2 (15.0% 
[3/20]).   

 
 
8 
 
Six (33%) of the 18 patients with positive findings in TP53 did not meet classic Li-Fraumeni 
syndrome, Li-Fraumeni-like, 2009 Chompret, or National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
guideline criteria for TP53 testing, resulting in a frequency of 0.06% (6/9605) unanticipated 
positive results. Four patients had a positive CDH1 result, 2 of whom did not meet International 
Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium testing criteria, resulting in a frequency of 0.02% (2/8708) 
positive CDH1 result.  
 
Overall, yields among patients with breast, ovarian, and colon/stomach cancers were 9.7%, 
13.4%, and 14.8%,   respectively. Approximately 5.8% of positive results among women with 
breast cancer were in highly penetrant genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 . The yield in 
Lynch syndrome genes among breast cancer patients was 0.5% (17/3315), higher than a 
published upper estimate of the prevalence of Lynch among the general population (0.2%). 
More than a quarter of patients with colon cancer tested positive for genes not considered to 
be classic colorectal cancer genes. Over 11% of the positive findings among women with 
endometrial cancer were in BRCA1 and BRCA2 . A small number of patients whose personal 
and family histories were not suggestive of Li-Fraumeni syndrome were positive for pathogenic 
variants in the TP53 gene. 
 
In 2014, LaDuca et al reported the clinical and molecular characteristics of 2079 patients who 
underwent panel testing with BreastNext (n=874), OvaNext (n=222), ColoNext (n=557) or 
CancerNext (n=425) .
3
   Most (94%) patients had a personal history of cancer or adenomatous 
polyps, and in 5% of cases, the proband was reported to be clinically unaffected. The positive 
and inconclusive rates for the panels were, respectively, 7.4% and 20% for BreastNext, 7.2% 
and 26% for OvaNext, 9.2% and 15% for ColoNext, and 9.6% and 24% for CancerNext. 
 
Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer  
O’Leary et al (2017) reported on 1085 cases with non-BRCA1 or BRCA2 breast cancer 
referred to their commercial laboratory who were found to have a pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
variant.
4
 The cases were divided into 3 groups based on the panel requested by the ordering 
physician: genes primarily associated with breast cancer (group A), genes associated with 
breast, gynecologic, and gastrointestinal cancer types (group B), and large comprehensive 
panels (group C). The proportion of positive findings in genes with breast management 
guidelines was inversely related to the size of the panel, 97.5% in group A, 63.6% in group B, 
and 50% in group C. Conversely, more positive findings and unexpected findings (there was 
no family history) were identified in actionable nonbreast cancer genes as the size of the panel 
increased. VUS rates also increased as the size of the panel increased, with 12.7% VUS in 
group A, 31.6% in group B, and 49.6% in group C. 
 
In a 2017 publication, Couch et al evaluated 21 genetic predisposition genes for breast cancer 
in a sample of 38,326 white women with breast cancer who received any one of a variety of 
genetic test panels (Ambry Genetics).
5
 The frequency of pathogenic variants was estimated at 
10.2%. After the exclusion of BRCA1, BRCA2, and syndromic breast cancer genes (CDH1, 
PTEN, TP53), 5 additional genes with variants classified as pathogenic by ClinVar were 
associated with high or moderately increased risk of breast cancer (see Table 5). Notably, of 
the various panels included in this study, only the 8 gene BRCAplus panel is limited to the set 
of genes (ATM, BRCA1, BRCA2, CDH1, CHEK2, PALB2, PTEN) that were associated with 
breast cancer in women of European descent.

Other studies have assessed the prevalence of pathogenic variants among patients with 
breast cancer who were referred for genetic testing, using a panel of 25 genes associated with 
inherited cancer predisposition (Myriad Genetics).  
 
A study by Buys et al (2017) included over 35,000 women with breast cancer who were 
assessed with the Myriad 25-gene panel.
6
 Pathogenic variants were identified in 9.3% of the 
women tested. Nearly half of those variants were in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. The 
remaining variants were found in other breast cancer genes, Lynch syndrome genes, and 
other panel genes. The VUS rate was 36.7%. 
 
A similar study by Langer et al (2016) evaluated the frequency of pathogenic variants identified 
with the 25-gene panel (Myriad Genetics) in 3088 patients with a personal history of ovarian 
cancer who were referred for testing.
7
 Pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were identified 
in 419 (13.6%) patients; of whom 7 patients had variants in 2 different genes. Nearly all 
patients (99.2%) met NCCN guidelines for HBOC testing (78.4%), Lynch syndrome testing 
(0.3%), or both (20.5%). Of the 419 patients with pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants, 277 
(65%) were identified in BRCA1 or BRCA2, 33 (7.8%) in Lynch syndrome-associated genes 
(PMS2, MSH6, MLH1, MSH2), and 26.8% in genes with a low to moderate increase in cancer 
risk: ATM, BRIP1, CHEK2, RAD51C, PALB2, NBN , or one of 6 other genes (<1% each). One 
or more VUS were reported in 1141 (36.9%) of patients. 
 
Kurian et al (2017) evaluated the association between gene variants on the Myriad 25-gene 
panel in 95,561 women and documented risk of breast or ovarian cancer from provider-
completed test requisition forms.
8
  Pathogenic variants were detected in 6,775 (7%) of the 
women. Multivariate regression models and case-control analysis estimated that 8 genes were 
associated with breast cancer with odds ratio (OR) from 2-fold (ATM) to 6-fold (BRCA1). 
Eleven genes were associated with ovarian cancer, with OR ranging from 2-fold (ATM) to 
40-fold (STK11), but statistical significance was achieved for only 3 genes (BRCA1, BRCA2, 
RAD51C). The clinical significance of the increase in cancer risk for the other genes is 
uncertain. Out of the 25 genes tested on the panel, there was an overlap of 3 genes (ATM, 
BRCA1, BRCA2) for the association of both breast and ovarian cancer, and not all genes on 
the panel were associated with risk of either cancer. 
 
Colorectal Cancer 
Pearlman et al (2021) reported on the prevalence of germline pathogenic variants among 
patients with CRC in the Ohio Colorectal Cancer Prevention Initiative.
9,
 All 3,310 patients 
enrolled in the study underwent testing for mismatch repair deficiency, and patients meeting at 
least 1 clinical criterion (mismatch repair deficiency, CRC diagnosis at less than 50 years of 
age, multiple primary tumors [CRC or endometrial cancer], or first degree relative with CRC or 

 
 
10 
endometrial cancer) underwent subsequent multigene panel testing. The specific multigene 
panel test used depended on the results of mismatch repair deficiency testing; patients with 
mismatch repair deficiency not explained by MLH1 hypermethylation (n=224) underwent 
testing with ColoSeq or BROCA panels, while patients with MLH1 hypermethylated tumors 
(n=99) and patients without mismatch repair deficiency (n=1,139) underwent testing with a 
myRisk panel. Panels tested for 25 to 66 cancer genes. Among the 1,462 patients who 
underwent multigene panel testing, 248 pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected 
in 234 patients (16% of patients who underwent multigene panel testing, and 7.1% of the entire 
study population). One hundred forty-two pathogenic variants were in mismatch repair 
deficiency genes, while 101 were in non-mismatch repair deficiency genes. If mismatch repair 
deficiency testing had been the only method used to screen for hereditary cancer syndromes, 
38.6% (91 of 236) of patients with a pathogenic variant in a cancer susceptibility gene or 
constitutional hypermethylation would have been missed, including 6.3% (9 of 144) of those 
with Lynch syndrome. One hundred seventy-five patients (5.3% of the entire study population) 
had pathogenic variants in genes with therapeutic targets. Variants of uncertain significance 
were found in 422 patients who underwent multigene panel testing (28.9%). 
 
In 2014, in an industry-sponsored study, Cragun et al reported the prevalence of clinically 
significant variants and variants of uncertain significance (VUSs) among patients who 
underwent ColoNext panel testing.
10
   For the period included in the study (March 2012-March 
2013), the ColoNext test included the MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2, EPCAM, BMPR1, SMAD4, 
STK11, APC, MUTYH, CHEK2, TP53, PTEN, and CDH1 genes; alterations were classified as 
follows: (1) pathogenic variant; (2) variant, likely pathogenic; (3) variant, unknown significance; 
(4) variant, likely benign; and (5) benign.  Data was analyzed for 586 patients whose ColoNext 
testing results and associated clinical data were maintained in a database by Ambry Genetics.  
Sixty-one (10.4%) patients had genetic alterations consistent with pathogenic variants or likely 
pathogenic variants; after 8 patients with only CHEK2 or 1 MUTYH variants were removed, 42 
(7.2%) patients were considered to have actionable variants.  One hundred eighteen (20.1%) 
patients had at least one VUS, including 14 patients who had at least one VUS in addition to a 
pathologic variant.  Of the 42 patients with a pathologic variant, most (30 [71%] patients) 
clearly met National Comprehensive Cancer Network guidelines for syndrome-based testing, 
screening, or diagnosis, based on the available clinical and family history.  The authors noted 
that, “The reality remains that syndrome-based testing would have been sufficient to identify 
the majority of patients with deleterious variants.  Consequently, the optimal and most cost-
effective use of panel-based testing as a first-tier test vs. a second-tier test (i.e., after 
syndrome-based testing is negative), remains to be determined.” 
 
Pan-Cancer Panels 
Rosenthal et al (2017) published an industry-sponsored study evaluating a 25-gene pan-
cancer panel.
11 
The analysis included 252223 consecutive individuals, most of whom (92.8%) 
met testing criteria for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer and/or Lynch syndrome. 
Pathogenic variants (n=17340) were identified in 17000 (6.7%) patients; the most common 
pathogenic variants were BRCA1 and BRCA2 (42.2%), other breast cancer genes (32.9%), 
Lynch syndrome genes (13.2%), and ovarian cancer genes (6.8%). Among individuals who 
met only hereditary breast and ovarian cancer or Lynch syndrome testing criteria, half of the 
pathogenic variants found were genes other than BRCA1 and BRCA2 or Lynch syndrome 
genes, respectively. The study was limited by reliance on providers for personal and family 
cancer histories and by uncertainty regarding the exact cancer risk spectrum for each gene 
included on the panel. 

 
 
11 
 
 
Idos et al (2018) conducted a prospective study that enrolled 2000 patients who had been 
referred for genetic testing at 1 of 3 academic medical centers (see Table 2).
12
  Patients 
underwent differential diagnosis by a genetic clinician prior to cancer panel testing for 25 or 28 
genes associated with breast or ovarian cancer, Lynch syndrome, and genes associated with 
gastric, colon, or pancreatic cancer. Results of the study are shown in Table 3. Twelve percent 
of the patients were found to have a pathogenic variant, of which 66% was anticipated by the 
genetic clinician and 34% were not anticipated. Most of the unanticipated results were in 
moderate to low penetrance genes. Thirty-four percent of the patients had a VUS and 53% of 
patients had benign results. Prophylactic surgery was performed more frequently in patients 
with a pathogenic variant (16%) compared to patients with a benign (2.4%) or unknown (2.3%) 
variant. Limitations in relevance and design and conduct are shown in Tables 4 and 5. 
Information on the actions associated with low to moderate penetrance genes were not 
reported. One concern with large panels is the increase in VUS. Having a VUS did not 
increase distress or uncertainty or diminish a positive experience of the testing in this study, 
and there was no increase in prophylactic surgery in patients with a VUS. However, all patients 
had received genetic counseling at an academic medical center regarding the outcomes of 
testing and this study may not be representative of community practice. In addition, a threshold 
for testing of 2.5% on a risk prediction model is a lower threshold than what is typically 
recommended. Patients with positive results were more likely to encourage relatives to 
undergo testing. Longer-term follow-up for clinical outcomes is ongoing.

In 2017, Lumish et al evaluated the impact of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer gene panel 
testing in 232 patients who had undergone gene panel testing after discussion with a genetic 
counselor.
13
 From this sample, 129 patients had a personal history of cancer (11 with a 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, 14 with a VUS, 104 with normal test results) and 103 had 
a family history of cancer (14 with a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant, 20 with a VUS, and 
69 with normal test results). The greatest impact of test results was for the 14 patients with a 
family history of breast or ovarian cancer who received a positive (pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic) test result, leading to greater distress and more frequent screening in 13 patients 
and prophylactic surgery in 1. Positive test results for the 11 patients with a personal history of 
cancer influenced their decision about the type of surgery for 4 (36.4%) patients. For the 20 
patients with a family history of cancer and a VUS result, distress increased to an intermediate 
level, and 7 (35%) patients reported that their test result would impact the decision to have 

 
 
13 
additional screening. The authors of this study noted that the VUS rate will increase with the 
number of genes in a panel and the choice of panel will need to optimize the chance of 
receiving results with clinical utility while minimizing the chance of results that have disutility 
and increase anxiety. 
 
Eliade et al (2017) evaluated the clinical actionability of a multigene panel in a cohort of 583 
patients with family history of breast or ovarian cancer.
14
 A pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
BRCA1 or BRCA2 variant was identified in 51 (9%) patients, and a pathogenic/likely 
pathogenic variant was identified in 10 other genes in the panel for 37 patients. The most 
frequently mutated genes were CHEK2 (n=12, 2%), ATM (n=9, 1.5%), and PALB2 (n=4, 
0.6%). The identification of a pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in a high-risk gene or in 2 
genes led to a change in surveillance or prophylactic surgery. In patients with positive findings 
in    moderate risk gene, breast MRI was recommended, while surveillance according to family 
history was recommended in patients with negative findings. There was no change in 
management in the 4 women with a positive finding in a low-risk gene (BRIP1, BARD1, 
RAD50). Individuals with negative findings could not be reassured, given the possibility of a 
pathogenic/likely pathogenic variant in an as-yet discovered gene. 
 
In 2014, Kurian et al evaluated the information from a NGS panel of 42 cancer-associated 
genes in women who had been previously referred for clinical BRCA1/2 testing after clinical 
evaluation of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer from 2002 to 2012.
15
   The authors aimed to 
assess concordance of the results of the panel with prior clinical sequencing, the prevalence of 
potentially clinically actionable results, and the downstream effects on cancer screening and 
risk reduction. Potentially actionable results were defined as pathogenic variants that cause 
recognized hereditary caner syndromes or have a published association with a 2-fold or 
greater relative risk of breast cancer compared with average-risk women. In total, 198 women 
participated in the study. Of these, 174 had breast cancer and 57 carried 59 germline 
BRCA1/2 variants.   Of the women who tested negative for BRCA1/2 variants (n=141), 16 had 
pathogenic variants in other genes (11.4%).   Overall, a total of 428 VUS were identified in 39 
genes, among 175 patients. Six women with variants in ATM, BLM, CDH1, NBN, and SLX4 
were advised to consider annual breast magnetic resonance imaging because of an estimated 
doubling of breast cancer risk, and 6 with variants in CDH1, MLH1, and MUTYH were advised 
to consider frequent colonoscopy and/or endoscopic gastroduodenoscopy (once every 1-2 
years) due to estimated increases in gastrointestinal cancer risk. One patient with an MLH1 
variant consistent with LS underwent risk-reducing salpingooophorectomy and early 
colonoscopy. 
 
Section Summary: Expanded Cancer Susceptibility Panels 
There is limited evidence on clinical validity for many of the genes in expanded panels. Most 
studies have been retrospective. These studies have reported on the frequency with which 
well-known cancer susceptibility variants are identified using large panels and have reported 
the VUS rate. The VUS rates increased in proportion with panel size, reaching nearly 50% for 
large gene panels. Although it may be possible to evaluate the clinical validity of some of the 
genes found on these panels, the clinical validity of expanded cancer susceptibility panels, 
which include variants associated with unknown or variable cancer risk, are of uncertain 
clinical validity. 
 
Data is lacking for the clinical utility of multigene panels for inherited cancer susceptibility 
panels. There are management guidelines for syndromes with high penetrance, which have 

 
 
14 
clinical utility in that they inform clinical decision-making and result in the prevention of adverse 
health outcomes. Clinical management recommendations for the inherited conditions 
associated with low-to-moderate penetrance are not standardized, and the clinical utility of 
genetic testing for these variants is uncertain and could potentially lead to harm. In addition, 
high rates of VUSs have been reported with the use of these panels. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
 
PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND POSITION STATEMENTS 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
A 2015 update of a policy statement on genetic and genomic testing for cancer susceptibility 
from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) addresses the application of next-
generation sequencing.
18
 The update addressed the application of next-generation sequencing 
and confirmed that panel testing may also identify variants in genes associated with moderate 
or low cancer risks, variants in high-penetrance genes that would not have been evaluated 
based on the presenting personal or family history, and as variants of uncertain significance in 
a substantial proportion of patient cases. Further, the statement indicated there is little 
consensus as to which genes should be included on panels for cancer susceptibility testing. 
 
In 2020, ASCO published a guideline on germline and somatic tumor testing in epithelial 
ovarian cancer.
19
 Based on a systematic review of evidence and expert panel input, ASCO 
recommended that women with epithelial ovarian cancer should be offered germline testing for 
BRCA1/2 and other specified ovarian susceptibility genes with a multigene panel. ASCO 
considered it more practical to evaluate a minimum of the 10 genes that have been associated 
with inherited risk of ovarian cancer in a panel in comparison to testing BRCA1 and BRCA2 
alone. 
 
In 2024, ASCO published guidance on the selection of germline genetic testing panels in 
patients with cancer.
18,
 Based on a systematic review of guidelines, consensus statements, 
and studies of germline and somatic genetic testing, an ASCO expert panel developed 
relevant recommendations. They stated that "patients should have a family history taken and 
recorded that includes details of cancers in first- and second-degree relatives and the patient's 
ethnicity. When more than one gene is relevant based on personal and/or family history, 
multigene panel testing should be offered." They provide specific guidance on strongly 
recommended genes to test for based on risk and cancer type, along with less strongly 
recommended genes. 
 
Collaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer 
In 2020, the Collaborative Group of the Americas on Inherited Gastrointestinal Cancer 
published a position statement on multi-gene panel testing for patients with colorectal cancer 
and/or polyposis.
19,
 Recommendations were based on the evidence, professional society 
recommendations endorsing testing of a given gene, and opinion of the expert panel. The 
group noted the variability in genes included in commercially available panels and 
recommended that multi-gene panels include a minimum of 11 specific genes associated with 
defective mismatch repair (Lynch syndrome) and polyposis syndromes. Additional genes to be 
considered had low to moderately increased risk, had limited data of colorectal cancer risk, or 
causation for colorectal cancer was not proven. 
 

 
 
15 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines on genetic/familial high-risk 
assessment for breast, ovarian, and/or pancreatic cancer (v. 3.2025)
20
 include the following on 
multigene testing: 
•  An individual's personal and/or family history may be explained by more than one 
inherited cancer syndrome; thus, phenotype-directed testing based on personal and 
family history through a multi-gene panel test may be more efficient and/or cost-
effective and increase the likelihood of detecting a pathogenic/likely pathogenic 
variant in a gene that will impact medical management for the individual or his/her at-
risk family members. 
• There may be a role for multigene testing in individuals who have tested negative 
(indeterminate) for a single syndrome, but whose personal or family history remains  
suggestive of an inherited susceptibility. 
• Some individuals may carry a pathogenic/likely pathogenic germline variant in more 
than one cancer susceptibility gene..." 
 
The NCCN defines a "tailored" multi-gene panel test as a "disease-focused multi-gene panel of 
clinically actionable cancer susceptibility genes, in contrast to large multi-gene panels of 
uncertain or unknown clinical relevance. The NCCN cautions that multi-gene panels may 
include moderate-risk genes that have limited data on the degree of cancer risk and no clear 
guidelines on risk management. As more genes are testing, the likelihood of finding variants of 
uncertain significance increases. Multi-gene panel testing also increases the likelihood of 
finding pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants without clear significance. 
 
NCCN guidelines on genetic/familial high risk assessment for colorectal cancer (v.4.2024) 
state that “when more than one gene can explain an inherited cancer syndrome, then multi-
gene testing is more efficient than single-gene testing, or sequential single syndrome testing” 
and “there is also a role for multi-gene testing in individuals who have tested negative 
(indeterminate) for a single syndrome, but whose personal or family history remains strongly 
suggestive of an inherited susceptibility.” However, NCCN cautions about the increased 
likelihood of finding VUS, which increases with the number of genes included in the panel, and 
that gene panels can include moderate-risk genes which may not be clinically actionable. In 
addition, the panel believes that there are insufficient data to recommend the use of multigene 
assays, Immunoscore, or post-surgical ctDNA to estimate risk of recurrence or determine 
adjuvant therapy.
21
 
 
U.S. Preventive Services Task Force Recommendations 
The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2019, updated 2024) recommends that primary 
care providers screen women with a personal or family history of breast, ovarian, tubal, or 
peritoneal cancer or who have an ancestry associated with BRCA1/2 gene mutations with  an 
appropriate brief familial risk assessment tool.
23  
Women with a positive screening results 
should receive genetic counseling and, if indicated after counseling, BRCA testing (grade B 
recommendation). The use of genetic cancer susceptibility panels is not specifically 
mentioned.
