Title: Genetic Testing - Chromosomal Microarray (CMA) Analysis 
and Next-Generation Sequencing Panels, for the 
Evaluation of Children with Developmental 
Delay/Intellectual Disability, Autism Spectrum Disorder, 
and/or Congenital Anomalies  
 
 
Description 
 
Chromosomal microarray (CMA) testing has been proposed for the detection of genetic 
imbalances in infants or children with characteristics of developmental delay/intellectual 
disability, autism spectrum disorder, and/or congenital anomalies. CMA testing increases the 
diagnostic yield over karyotyping in children with the aforementioned characteristics, and CMA 
testing may impact clinical management decisions. Next-generation sequencing panel testing 
allows for the simultaneous analysis of a large number of genes and, in patients with normal 
CMA testing, next-generation testing has been proposed as a way to identify single-gene 
causes of syndromes that have autism as a significant clinical feature.

Background 
 
DIAGNOSTIC TESTING 
 
Karyotyping and Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization   
The goal of a cytogenetic evaluation is to identify chromosomal imbalances that cause a 
disorder. The most common imbalances are copy number variants (CNVs) or deletions and 
duplications of large segments of genomic material. CNVs are common in DD/ID and autism 
spectrum disorder (ASD) but more often reflect normal genetic variation.
1
 However, de novo 
CNVs are observed about 4 times more frequently in children with ASD than in normal 
individuals.
2
 Less frequently, other abnormalities such as balanced translocations (i.e., 
exchanges of equally sized DNA loci between chromosomes) may be pathogenic. For many 
well described syndromes, the type and location of the associated chromosomal abnormality 
have been established by studying large patient samples. For others, few patients with similar 
abnormalities may have been evaluated to establish genotype-phenotype correlation. Finally, 
in some patients, cytogenetic analysis will discover chromosomal abnormalities that require 
study to determine their significance. 
 
Prior to the advent of CMAs, the initial step in cytogenetic analysis was G-banded karyotyping, 
which evaluates all chromosomes. High-resolution G-banding can detect changes as small as 
3 to 5 megabases (Mb) in size, although standard G-banding evaluates more than 10-Mb 
changes. In children with DD/ID, a review by Stankiewicz and Beaudet (2007) found G-banded 
karyotyping diagnostic in approximately 3% to 5%.
3
 In ASD, high-resolution karyotyping 
appears to identify abnormalities in up to 5% of cases.
4
 
 
In contrast, molecular cytogenetic techniques can detect small submicroscopic chromosomal 
alterations. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), a targeted approach, is used to identify 
specific chromosomal abnormalities associated with suspected diagnoses such as DiGeorge 
syndrome. Prior to CMAs, FISH was also used to screen the rearrangement-prone 
subtelomeric regions. Subtelomeric FISH was found to identify abnormalities in children with 

 
3 
DD and ID,
5
 diagnostic in approximately 5% to 6% of those with negative karyotypes, but 
uncommonly in ASD.
6
 
 
Chromosomal Microarrays  
Two types of CMAs are considered here: array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) 
and single nucleotide variants (SNV) arrays. The aCGH approach uses DNA samples from a 
patient and normal control. Each is labeled with distinct fluorescent dyes (red or green). The 
labeled samples are then mixed and hybridized to thousands of cloned or synthesized 
reference (normal) DNA fragments of known genomic locus immobilized on a glass slide 
(microarray) to conduct thousands of comparative reactions simultaneously. CNVs are 
determined by computer analysis of the array patterns and intensities of the hybridization 
signals. If the patient sequence is missing part of the normal sequence (a deletion) or has the 
normal sequence plus additional genomic material within that genomic location (e.g., a 
duplication), the sequence imbalance is detected as a difference in fluorescence intensity (Korf 
and Rehm [2013]
7
 offer an illustrative graphic). For this reason, aCGH cannot detect balanced 
chromosomal translations (equal exchange of material between chromosomes) or sequence 
inversions (same sequence is present in reverse base pair order) because the fluorescence 
intensity would not change. A portion of the increased diagnostic yield from CMA over 
karyotyping comes from the discovery that chromosomal rearrangements that appear 
balanced (and therefore not pathogenic) by G-banded karyotype analysis are found to have 
small imbalances with greater resolution. It has been estimated that 40% of apparently 
balanced de novo or inherited translocations with abnormal phenotype are associated with 
cryptic deletion if analyzed by CMA testing. 
 
Like aCGH, SNV arrays detect CNVs. In an SNV array, the 2 alleles for genes of interest are 
tagged with different florescent dyes. Comparative florescence intensity will be increased when 
there are duplications and diminished with deletions. The resolution provided by aCGH is 
higher than that with SNV arrays. In addition, aCGH has better signal-to-background 
characteristics than SNV arrays. In contrast to aCGH, SNV arrays will also identify long 
stretches of DNA homozygosity, which may suggest uniparental disomy (UPD) or 
consanguinity. UPD occurs when a child inherits 2 copies of a chromosome from 1 parent and 
no copies from the other parent. UPD can lead to syndromes such as Angelman and Prader-
Willi. 
 
Table 1 summarizes the cytogenetic tests used to evaluate children with DD/ID and autism. 
The table emphasizes the large difference in resolution between karyotyping and CMA.

Microarrays may be prepared by the laboratory using the technology or, more commonly, by 
commercial manufacturers, and sold to laboratories that must qualify and validate the product 
for use in their assay, in conjunction with computerized software for interpretation. The 
proliferation of laboratory-developed and commercially available platforms prompted the 
American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) to publish guidelines for the design and 

 
4 
performance expectations for clinical microarrays and associated software in the postnatal 
setting.

Next-Generation Sequencing  
Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has been proposed to detect single-gene causes of autism 
and possibly identify a syndrome that involves autism in patients with normal array-based 
testing. NGS involves the sequencing of millions of fragments of genetic material in a 
massively parallel fashion. NGS can be performed on segments of genetic material of various 
sizes—from the entire genome (whole-genome sequencing) to small subsets of genes 
(targeted sequencing). NGS allows the detection of SNVs, CNVs, insertions, and deletions. 
With higher resolution comes higher likelihood of detection of variants of uncertain 
significance. 
 
GENETIC ASSOCIATIONS WITH DEVELOPMENTAL DELAY/INTELLECTUAL DISABILITY 
AND AUTISM SPECTRUM DISORDER 
For common phenotypes and syndromes, the pathogenicity of CNVs may be supported by 
considerable evidence; for uncommon phenotypes and uncommon CNVs determining 
pathogenicity requires a systematic evaluation that includes parental studies, examining 
databases for reported associations, and considering the molecular consequences of the 
identified variant. Parental studies (e.g., “trio” testing of affected child, father, and mother) can 
identify an inherited CNV from an unaffected parent and therefore considered benign.
9
 A 
variety of databases index the clinical implications of CNVs their associations with a particular 
phenotype. CNVs are continuously cataloged and, with growth in CMA testing and improved 
resolution, databases have become increasingly extensive (e.g., DECIPHER 
[https://decipher.sanger.ac.uk], ClinVar [http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/clinvar/]). For uncommon 
CNVs, in addition to reports of CNV-phenotype associations, the location and size of the CNV 
can offer clues to pathogenicity; larger CNVs are more often pathogenic and the role of 
affected genes in brain circuitry and effect of CNV on gene expression can implicate 
pathogenicity. Although uncommon, an observed phenotype can result from unmasking a 
mutated recessive allele on the unaffected (non-CNV) chromosome.
10
 Other considerations 
when determining pathogenicity include CNV dosage, X linkage, number of reports in the 
literature of association between CNV and phenotype, and findings in “normal” individuals. 
 
The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) has published guidelines for evaluating, 
interpreting, and reporting pathogenicity reflecting these principles.
11
 The recommended 
categories of clinical significance for reporting are pathogenic, uncertain clinical significance 
(likely pathogenic, likely benign, or no subclassification), or benign. The International 
Standards for Cytogenomic Arrays Consortium more recently proposed “an evidence-based 
approach to guide the development of content on chromosomal microarrays and to support 
interpretation of clinically significant copy number variation.”
12
 The proposal defined levels of 
evidence describe how well or how poorly detected variants or CNVs correlate with phenotype. 
 
  
SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE 
 
For individuals who have DD/ID, ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-
delineated genetic syndrome who receive CMA testing, the evidence includes primarily case 
series.  Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, changes in reproductive decision 
making, morbid events, and resource utilization.  The available evidence supports test 
 
 

 
5 
accuracy and validity.  Although systematic studies of the impact of CMA on patient outcomes 
are lacking, the improvement in diagnostic yield over karyotyping has been well-demonstrated. 
While direct evidence of improved outcomes with CMA compared with karyotyping is lacking, 
at least a subset of the disorders potentially diagnosed with CMA testing in this patient 
population, there are well-defined and accepted management steps associated with positive 
test results.  Further, there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision making as a result 
of positive test results.  The information derived from CMA testing can: end a long diagnostic 
odyssey, result in a reduction in morbidity for certain conditions with initiation of surveillance or 
management of associated comorbidities, and may impact future reproductive decision making 
for parents and potentially the affected child.  The evidence is sufficient to determine that the 
technology results in a meaningful improvement in the net health outcome. 
 
For individuals who have DD/ID, ASD, or multiple congenital anomalies not specific to a well-
delineated genetic syndrome who receive next-generation sequencing panel testing, the 
evidence includes primarily case series. Relevant outcomes are test accuracy and validity, 
changes in reproductive decision making, morbid events, and resource utilization.  The rates of 
variants of uncertain significance associated with next-generation sequencing panel testing in 
this patient population are not well-characterized.  The yield of testing and likelihood of an 
uncertain result is variable, based on gene panel, gene tested, and patient population.  There 
are real risks of uninterpretable and incidental results.  The evidence is insufficient to 
determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. 
  
Rationale 
 
This review has been informed by a TEC Special Report (2009) on array comparative genomic 
hybridization (aCGH)
13
 and a TEC Special Report (2015) on chromosomal microarray (CMA) 
testing for the genetic evaluation of patients with global developmental delay (DD), intellectual 
disability (ID), and autism spectrum disorder (ASD).
14
 
 
Evidence reviews assess clinical evidence to determine whether the use of a technology 
improves the net health outcome. Broadly defined, health outcomes are length of life, quality of 
life, and ability to function including benefits and harms. Every clinical condition has specific 
outcomes that are important to the individual and to managing the course of that condition. 
Validated outcome measures are necessary to ascertain whether a condition improves or 
worsens; and whether the magnitude of that change is clinically significant. The net health 
outcome is a balance of benefits and harms. The following is a summary of the key literature to 
date. 
 
Developmental Delay/Intellectual Disability 
Developmental delay (DD) is diagnosed in children five years or younger who show a 
significant delay in two or more developmental domains: gross or fine motor, speech/language, 
cognitive, social/personal, and activities of daily living.
15
 DD can precede the development of 
intellectual disability (ID)  as the child ages.
16
 
 
ID is manifested by significant limitations in intellectual functioning and adaptive behavior. It is 
diagnosed at or after age 5 (when intelligence testing is considered valid and reliable) but prior 
to age 18 and is lifelong. The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders: Fifth 
Edition (DSM-5) defines ID as occurring during the developmental period and involving 
 
 

 
6 
impairments of general mental abilities (e.g., IQ <70 or 75) that impact adaptive functioning in 
the conceptual, social, and practical domains.
17
 
 
The national prevalence of developmental delay and intellectual disability were estimated at 
4.1% and 1.2%, respectively, in US children based on data from the 2009 to 2017 National 
Health Interview Survey.
18
  Both are influenced by genetic, environmental, infectious, and 
perinatal factors. Approximately 450 genes have been causally related to ID; most genes 
(»90%) are associated with syndromes.
19
 Inheritance of ID can be autosomal-dominant, 
recessive, or X-linked; and most nonsyndromic genes are located on the X chromosome. Prior 
to the advent of whole-exome and genome sequencing, Willemsen and Kleefstra (2014) 
concluded that 20% to 40% of ID cases could be attributed to a genetic variant.
20
 With the use 
of whole-genome sequencing, they estimated that almost 60% of cases have an identifiable 
genetic etiology. 
 
Congenital anomalies are frequently present in children with DD and ID. In addition, a 
suspected etiology can often be established from history and physical examination ( for skilled 
specialists, as much as 20% to 40% of cases) without genetic testing.
21
 The recommended 
approach to evaluation in DD/ID begins with 3-generation family history and physical (including 
neurologic) exam. Subsequent testing is used to confirm a suspected diagnosis (e.g., targeted 
fluorescent in situ hybridization [FISH] testing for DiGeorge or cri-du-chat syndromes). If no 
diagnosis is suspected, fragile X syndrome testing, metabolic testing for inborn errors of 
metabolism, and CMA testing (without karyotyping) are recommended, regardless of the 
presence or absence of dysmorphologic features or congenital anomalies.
15
 
 
Autism Spectrum Disorder 
DSM-5 definesASD15,[a] as the presence of:
17 
• Persistent deficits in social communication and social interaction across multiple 
contexts, 
• Restricted, repetitive patterns of behavior, interests, or activities, 
• Symptoms in the early developmental period (typically recognized in the first two years 
of life), and 
• Symptoms causing clinically significant impairment in social, occupational, or other 
important areas of current functioning. 
 
The estimated prevalence of ASD in US children is estimated to be 3.11%, and is higher 
among boys (4.66%) than girls (1.50%).
19,
 
 
An accurate diagnosis can generally be made by 
age two. The evaluation includes developmental screening and diagnostic evaluation (i.e., 
hearing, vision, and neurological testing; laboratory testing for metabolic disorders; and genetic 
testing). 
 
A large body of evidence supports a genetic etiology in ASD. Twin studies estimate heritability 
between 60% and 90%.
2
 A family with an affected child has a 13% to 19% risk for recurrence 
in subsequent children.
22
 Based on Swedish genetic studies, Gaugler et al (2014) concluded 
that “the bulk of autism arises from genetic variation” (as opposed to environmental causes).
23 
Still, although genetic determinants can be heritable, most appear to arise de novo.
2
 
 
For these reasons, a child with ASD is often evaluated with genetic testing. Testing may be 
targeted when a child has a recognizable syndrome such as those shown in Table 2. 
Alternatively, high-resolution cytogenetic analysis evaluating multiple genes-the focus of this 
evidence review-is used.

CHROMOSOMAL MICROARRAY TESTING 
 
Study Selection Criteria 
For the evaluation of clinical validity of the CMA test, studies that met the following eligibility 
criteria were considered: case series or cohort studies that enrolled 20 or more patients with 
clinical diagnoses DD/ID or ASD with known or suspicion of genetic abnormalities, with or 
without negative results by conventional cytogenetic evaluation, and performed CMA testing 
on enrolled patients. Studies were also included if they examined management decisions 
and/or patient outcomes based on genetic evaluation results. 
 
Case Series or Cohort Studies  
Several studies have conducted CMA testing on samples with known chromosomal 
abnormalities using standard karyotyping and are summarized in Table 3. The median 
diagnostic yield in DD/ID patients from 21 studies published after 2012 was 19%. Most studies 
included patients with prior normal studies (e.g., karyotype and FMR1 testing). However, it is 
difficult to assess phenotype severity across studies owing to reporting and how samples were 
assembled. For a recent comparison, investigators reported diagnostic yield from 1133 
children enrolled in the U.K. Deciphering Developmental Disorders study for whom a diagnosis 
was not established prior to CMA testing.
26
 Using both CMA and exome sequencing, a 
diagnostic yield of 27% was achieved.

As noted, CMA testing has a higher diagnostic yield than standard karyotyping, which is an 
accepted test in the evaluation of DD/ID, ASD, and congenital anomalies. In some cases, 
disorders are defined by the presence of a genetic variant or genetic testing can contribute to 
the diagnosis. 
 
In some cases, a specific diagnosis leads to management changes that are either standard of 
care or are likely to lead to improvements in outcomes. 
 
Changes in Management 
A reasonable body of literature has evaluated whether or not the establishment of a definitive 
diagnosis in patients with DD/ID, ASD, and/or congenital anomalies leads to changes in 
management that are likely to improve outcomes. Of particular interest in the use of CMA 
testing to make a specific genetic diagnosis in a patient with DD/ID, ASD, and/or congenital 
anomalies is the effect of that diagnosis on the patient’s family. Because many affected 
patients will be evaluated for testing in childhood, the implications of testing on family members 
and the reciprocal effect on the patient are considerations. 
 
Results of six retrospective studies that examined the potential impact of CMA results on 
clinical decisions are summarized in Table 8. These studies collectively indicate that identified 
pathogenic variants can prompt clinical actions potentially impacting morbidity. Less clear is 
how often the outcome will be improved and in which cases interventions might have occurred 
in the absence of testing. The proportion that may benefit will depend on the variants identified 
as well as diagnostic yield, which in turn depends on phenotype severity. Studies did not report 
on any follow-up or management changes in patients without identified pathogenic variants. In 
addition to reducing morbidity, bringing closure to a diagnostic odyssey is a reason for genetic 
testing cited by parents
100
 and noted as an outcome in case series and reports.
101
 For 
example, Turner et al (2008) found a median of 16.5 years from the initial medical contact to 
identify a causal variant in 38 extended families with fragile X syndrome.
102
 Saam et al (2008) 
noted that CMA testing may influence that odyssey.
65
 Parents cite obtaining services and 
support as a reason for testing but how the frequency can impact outcomes is difficult to 
quantify. The studies reviewed convey a set of intermediate outcomes likely to favorably affect 

 
13 
the health of some children. Lacking are end-to-end studies following children at presentation 
to final outcomes. In addition to these studies, Lingen et al (2016) has reported a benefit for 
maternal quality of life if aCGH tests succeed to clarify the etiologic diagnosis in an affected 
child.

Reproductive Decision Making 
Risk estimates for recurrence of disease in future births can be altered considerably by 
information from the genetic diagnosis (see Table 7). Having a child with ASD appears to 
impact reproductive decision-making or so-called reproductive stoppage. For example, 
Hoffmann et al (2014) examined reproductive stoppage in families with ASD using the 
California Department of Developmental Services database linked to birth certificates.106, 
Between 1990 and 2003, 19,710 families with 39,361 siblings and half-siblings were identified. 
Birth histories in these families were then compared with a control group (matched 2:1 by sex, 
birth year, maternal age, ethnicity/race, and county). Investigators found fertility rates in case 
and control families similar in the 2 years following the birth of a child with ASD, but, in the 
subsequent years, the rate was 33% (95% confidence interval, 30% to 37%) lower in families 
having a child affected by ASD.

Section Summary: Chromosomal Microarray Testing  
The evidence for CMA testing for a definitive diagnosis in individuals with DD/ID, ASD, and/or 
congenital anomalies consists of studies reporting on the yield of a positive test in affected 
individuals, combined with an indirect chain of evidence to support the clinical utility of testing. 
The yield of testing varies depending on the underlying population tested, but is generally 
higher than 10%, with higher rates in patients with congenital anomalies.  While direct 
evidence of improved outcomes with CMA compared with karyotype is lacking, for at least a 
subset of the disorders potentially diagnosed with CMA in this patient population, there are 
well-defined and accepted management steps associated with positive test results.  Further, 
there is evidence of changes in reproductive decision making as a result of positive test 

 
15 
results. For children with idiopathic growth  or language delay, clinical validity has not been 
established and there is no direct or indirect evidence to support clinical utility. 
 
NEXT-GENERATION SEQUENCING Panel Testing 
 
Clinical Context and Test Purpose  
The purpose of gene panel testing with next generation sequencing (NGS) is to identify a 
genetic cause for individuals with DD/ID, ASD, and congenital anomalies.  A genetic diagnosis 
may end a diagnostic odyssey, improve treatment, facilitate the management of associated 
medical conditions, and permit carrier testing to assess risks to future offspring. 
 
Case Series or Cohort Studies 
Several studies have assessed next-generation sequencing panel testing on samples from 
patients with intellectual disability with negative aCGH testing. Table 8 summarizes the 
diagnostic yield. For example, Grozeva et al (2016) reported that next-generation sequencing 
targeted testing resulted in an 11% additional diagnostic yield beyond the 10% to 15% yield 
from aCGH alone.
107,
 However, Kalsner et al (2018) reported no increase in yield using an 
NGS panel.

Section Summary: Next-Generation Sequencing  
It is arguable that the indirect chain of evidence for the use of CMA in evaluating DD/ID, ASD, 
and/or congenital anomalies would apply to NGS panels. However, the clinical validity of NGS 
panels is less well-established than for CMA, particularly regarding VOUS rates.  The yield of 
testing and likelihood of an uncertain result is variable, based on gene panel, gene tested, and 
patient population.  There are real risks of uninterpretable and incidental results.  Therefore, 
the evidence does not permit conclusions whether NGS panel testing improves outcomes. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
 
PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND POSITION STATEMENTS 
Guidelines or position statements will be considered for inclusion in ‘Supplemental Information' 
if they are issued by, or jointly by, a US professional society, an international  society with US 
representation, or National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE). Priority will be 
given to guidelines that are informed by a systematic review, include  strength of evidence 
ratings, and include a description of management of conflict of interest. 
 
American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) 
In 2014, the AAP issued a clinical report on the optimal medical genetics evaluation of a child 
with global developmental delays (GDD) or ID.
15
 Regarding CMA testing, this report states: 
 
“CMA now should be considered a first-tier diagnostic test in all children with GDD/ID for whom 
the causal diagnosis is not known...CMA is now the standard for diagnosis of patients with 
GDD/ID, as well as other conditions, such as autism spectrum disorders or multiple congenital 
anomalies.” 
 
In 2020, the AAP issued a clinical report on identifying infants and young children with 
developmental disorders through surveillance and screening. 
115
 The report proposed a 
screening model that included performing a complete medical evaluation and stated that a 
"child with suspected global developmental delay or intellectual disability should have 
laboratory testing done, including chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing[...] Further 
testing may be indicated when a diagnosis is not established with initial laboratory evaluation 
including whole exome sequencing and gene panels." 
 
In 2025, the AAP updated their clinical report on genetic evaluation of a child with intellectual 
disability or global developmental delay.
116
 The AAP recommends exome/genome sequencing 
as a first-tier test for GDD/ID in most circumstances because of superior diagnostic yield and 
higher cost-effectiveness if pursued earlier in the diagnostic process. 
 
American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry  
In 2014, the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry updated its guidelines on 
the assessment and treatment of children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder 
(ASD).
109
  The Academy recommended that “all children with ASD should have a medical 
assessment, which typically includes physical examination, a hearing screen, a Wood's lamp 

 
17 
examination for signs of tuberous sclerosis, and genetic testing, which may include G-banded 
karyotype, fragile X testing, or chromosomal microarray.” 
 
American Academy of Neurology and Child Neurology Society 
In 2011, the American Academy of Neurology and the Practice Committee of the Child 
Neurology Society updated their guideline regarding the evaluation of unexplained global 
developmental delay/intellectual disability with information on genetic and metabolic 
(biochemical) testing in order to accommodate advances in the field.
110
  The guidelines 
concluded that CMA testing has the highest diagnostic yield in children with DD/ID, ASD, or 
multiple congenital anomalies (MCA).  Often complex results require confirmation and careful 
interpretation, often with the assistance of a medical geneticist, and that CMA should be 
considered the first-line test.  The guidelines acknowledge that “Research is sorely lacking on 
the medical, social and financial benefits of having an accurate etiologic diagnosis.”  
 
American College of Medical Genetics 
The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) (2010; reaffirmed 2020) published 
guidelines on array-based technologies and their clinical utilization for detecting chromosomal 
abnormalities.
111, 112
  Chromosomal microarray testing for copy number variation (CNV) is 
recommended as a first-line test in the initial postnatal evaluation of individuals with the 
following:  
• Multiple anomalies not specific to a well-delineated genetic syndrome  
• Apparently non-syndromic developmental delay/ intellectual disability  
• Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) 
 
Other ACMG guidelines have addressed the design and performance expectations for clinical 
microarrays and associated software
8
 and for the interpretation and reporting of CNVs,
11
 both 
intended for the post-natal setting.  A 2013 update includes recommendations for validation of 
microarray methodologies for both prenatal and postnatal specimens.
113
 
 
A 2013 guideline update from the ACMG states that a stepwise or tiered approach to the 
clinical genetic diagnostic evaluation of autism spectrum disorder is recommended, with the 
recommendation being for first-tier to include FXS [fragile X syndrome] and CMA, and second 
tier to include MECP2 and PTEN testing.
114
  The guideline states that  
 
“This approach will evolve with continued advancements in diagnostic testing and improved 
understanding of the ASD phenotype. Multiple additional conditions have been reported in 
association with an ASD phenotype, but none of these have been evaluated in a large 
prospective cohort. Therefore, a future third tier of evaluation is a distinct possibility. Further 
studies would be needed to elevate the evidence to the point of recommended testing. 
Alternatively, advances in technology may permit bundling of individual tests into an 
extended, more readily accessible, and less expensive platform.” The accumulating 
evidence using next-generation sequencing (third tier testing) “will increase the diagnostic 
yield even more over the next few years.”

Regulatory Status 
 
CMA analysis and NGS are commercially available from several laboratories as laboratory-
developed tests. Laboratory-developed tests performed by laboratories licensed for high 
complexity testing under the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) do not 
require U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) clearance for marketing.  
 
In July 2010, the FDA indicated that the agency would require microarray manufacturers to 
seek clearance in order to sell their products for use in clinical cytogenetics.  
 
CMA Testing 
CMA Testing CMA testing is commercially available through many laboratories and includes 
targeted and whole genome arrays, with or without SNV microarray analysis. 
 
On January 17, 2014, the FDA cleared the Affymetrix CytoScan® Dx Assay for marketing.  
The FDA reviewed the Affymetrix CytoScan Dx Assay through its de novo classification 
process.  For the de novo petition, the review of the CytoScan Dx Assay included an analytic 
evaluation of the test’s ability to accurately detect numerous chromosomal variations of 
different types, sizes, and genome locations when compared with several analytically validated 
test methods. The FDA found that the CytoScan Dx Assay could analyze a patient’s entire 
genome and adequately detect chromosome variations in regions of the genome associated 
with intellectual and developmental disabilities.  FDA product code: PFX
