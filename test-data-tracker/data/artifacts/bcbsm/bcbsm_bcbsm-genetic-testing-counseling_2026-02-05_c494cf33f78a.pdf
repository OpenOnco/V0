Title: Genetic Testing and Counseling 
 
This policy applies only if there is not a separate joint medical policy that outlines criteria for 
genetic testing for a specific condition. If a separate joint policy exists, then the 
inclusionary/exclusionary guidelines in that policy supersede the guidelines in this policy. 
 
Description/Background 
 
The purpose of this conceptual framework is to assist evaluation of the utility of genetic tests. 
In providing a framework for evaluating genetic tests, this review will not determine the clinical 
utility of genetic testing for specific disorders. Rather, it provides guidelines that can be applied 
to a wide range of tests. 
 
This conceptual framework applies only if there is not a separate evidence review that outlines 
specific criteria for testing. If a separate review exists, then the criteria for medical necessity in 
that evidence review supersede the guidelines herein. 
 
This conceptual framework does not include cytogenetic testing (karyotyping), biochemical 
testing, or molecular testing for infectious disease. 
 
This conceptual framework also does not address reproductive genetic testing. There are 
separate medical policies for genetic testing in the reproductive setting, addressing, e.g., 
carrier testing for genetic diseases, invasive prenatal (fetal) diagnostic testing, and 
preimplantation genetic testing. 
 
The following categories of genetic testing are addressed herein:  
1. Testing of an affected (symptomatic) individual’s germline to benefit the individual  
a. Diagnostic  
b. Prognostic  
c. Therapeutic  
 
2. Testing cancer cells of an affected individual to benefit the individual  
a. Diagnostic  

 
2 
b. Prognostic  
c. Therapeutic  
3. Testing an asymptomatic individual to determine future risk of disease  
4. Testing of an affected individual’s germline to benefit family members.  
 
DEFINITIONS  
 
Genetic Testing  
Genetic testing involves the analysis of chromosomes, DNA, RNA, genes, or gene products to 
detect inherited (germline) or noninherited (somatic) genetic variants related to disease or 
health. 
 
Carrier Testing  
A carrier of a genetic disorder has 1 abnormal allele for a disorder. When associated with an 
autosomal recessive or X-linked disorder, carriers of the causative variant are typically 
unaffected. When associated with an autosomal dominant disorder, the person has 1 normal 
copy of the gene and 1 mutated copy of the gene; such a person may be affected with the 
disorder, may be unaffected but at high risk of developing the disease later in life, or may 
remain unaffected because of the sex-limited nature of the disease. Carrier testing may be 
offered to people: (a) who have family members with a genetic condition; (b) who have family 
members who are identified carriers; and (c) who are members of ethnic or racial groups 
known to have a higher carrier rate for a particular condition. 
 
Germline Variants  
Germline variants are present in the DNA of every cell of the body, from the moment of 
conception. They include cells in the gonads (testes or ova) and could, therefore, be passed 
on to offspring. 
 
Somatic Variants  
Somatic variations occur with the passage of time and are restricted to a specific cell or cells 
derived from it. If these variants are limited to cells that are not in the gonads, they will not be 
passed on to offspring. 
 
Pharmacogenomics  
Pharmacogenomics studies how a person’s genetic makeup affects his or her body’s response 
to drugs. 
 
 
Regulatory Status: 
 
Several agencies are involved in oversight of genetic testing. The Centers for Medicare and 
Medicaid Services (CMS) regulates clinical laboratory testing to ensure laboratory compliance 
with the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment of 1988, showing accuracy and 
reliability in conducting assays. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) oversees advertising of 
tests and products. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates tests sold as 
"diagnostic devices," that is, tests manufactured by one company and then sold as a kit to a 
laboratory for genetic testing. However, the FDA does not regulate "home brew" tests, that is, 
tests that are both manufactured and performed by the same laboratory. Many common 
genetic tests (including the BRCA breast cancer gene tests) fall into this category. Because of 
this regulatory exception, genetic testing services using home brew tests can be marketed 
directly to the medical community - and the public - without FDA regulation or oversight.

Medical Policy Statement 
 
The safety and effectiveness of genetic testing and counseling services have been 
established.  They may be considered useful diagnostic options only if the testing results are 
expected to establish or verify a diagnosis, initiate a treatment plan and/or alter the patient’s 
health care management. 
 
Inclusionary and Exclusionary Guidelines
  
 
Genetic testing classified in one of the categories below is established when all criteria are met 
for each category: 
1.  Testing of an affected (symptomatic) individual’s germline DNA to benefit the individual 
(excluding reproductive testing) 
a.  Diagnostic 
b.  Prognostic 
c.   Therapeutic 
2.  Testing cancer cells of an affected individual to benefit the individual 
a.  Diagnostic 
b.  Prognostic 
c.   Therapeutic 
3.  Testing an asymptomatic individual to determine future risk of disease 
 
Genetic testing that does not meet the criteria for a specific category is considered 
experimental/investigational. 
 
For the following category of testing, the benefit of testing is for a family member rather than 
the individual being tested. In this category, the criteria developed are for clinical utility.  
• Testing of an affected individual’s germline to benefit family member(s).  
 
Genetic testing is considered experimental/investigational when:  
• testing is not considered standard of care, such as when the clinical diagnosis can be 
made without the use of a genetic test;  
• testing is not clinically appropriate for the patient’s condition (e.g., when it would not 
change diagnosis and/or management). Other situations where testing is not clinically 
appropriate include, but are not limited to:  
o testing performed entirely for nonmedical (e.g., social) reasons;  
o testing not expected to provide a definitive diagnosis that would obviate the need 
for further testing.  
• testing is performed primarily for the convenience of the patient, physician, or other 
health care provider;  
• testing would result in outcomes that are equivalent to outcomes using an alternative 
strategy, and the genetic test is more costly.

Rationale 
 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES OF GENETIC TESTS  
A test should be cleared or approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or performed 
in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments‒certified laboratory. 
 
Evidence reviews assess whether a medical test is clinically useful. A useful test provides 
information to make a clinical management decision that improves the net health outcome. 
That is, the balance benefits and harms is better when the test is used to manage the condition 
than when another test or no test is used to manage the condition. 
 
The following rubric outlines the steps in assessing a medical test. The first step is to formulate 
the clinical context and purpose of the test. Then the evidence is reviewed to determine 
whether the test is technically reliable, clinically valid, and clinically useful. However, as noted 
below, technical reliability is outside the scope of evidence reviews.

TYPES OF GENETIC TESTS ADDRESSED IN THIS CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK  
1. Testing of an affected (symptomatic) individual’s germline to benefit the individual 
(excluding reproductive testing)  
a. Diagnostic: To confirm or exclude genetic or heritable variants in a 
symptomatic person. This refers to a molecular diagnosis supported by the 
presence of a known pathogenic variant. For genetic testing, a symptomatic 

 
2 
person is defined as an individual with a clinical phenotype correlated with a 
known pathogenic variant.  
b. Prognostic: To determine or refine estimates of disease natural history or 
recurrence in patients already diagnosed with disease in order to predict 
natural disease course (e.g., aggressiveness, recurrence, risk of death). This 
type of testing may use gene expression of affected tissue to predict the 
course of disease (e.g., testing breast cancer tissue with Oncotype DX).  
c. Therapeutic: To determine that a particular therapeutic intervention is effective 
(or ineffective) for an individual. To determine the probability of favorable or 
adverse response to medications. To detect genetic variants that alter risk of 
treatment response, adverse events, drug metabolism, drug effectiveness, etc. 
(e.g., cytochrome P450 testing). To detect genetic variants that adversely 
affect response to exposures in the environment that are ordinarily tolerated 
(e.g., G6PD deficiency, genetic disorders of immune function, 
aminoacidopathies).  
2. Testing cancer cells of an affected individual to benefit the individual  
a. Diagnostic: To determine the origin of a cancer or to determine a clinically 
relevant subgroup into which a cancer is classified.  
b. Prognostic: To determine the risk of progression, recurrence, or mortality for a 
cancer that is already diagnosed.  
c. Therapeutic: To determine the likelihood that a patient will respond to a 
targeted cancer therapy that is based on the presence or absence of a specific 
variant.  
3. Testing an asymptomatic individual to determine future risk of disease. To detect 
genetic variants associated with disorders that appear after birth, usually later in life. 
Such testing is intended for individuals with a family history of a genetic disorder, but 
who themselves have no features of the disorder, at the time of testing, in order to 
determine their risk for developing the disorder.  
4. Testing of an affected individual’s germline to benefit family member(s). To focus and 
direct family testing of asymptomatic relatives, by testing an individual with known 
disease but in whom the presence or absence of a pathogenic variant has not been 
determined.  
 
MEDICAL NECESSITY CRITERIA  
The criteria listed below for medical necessity represent minimum criteria that must be met in 
each category to conclude that a test is medically necessary.   
 
Genetic testing is considered medically necessary for a genetic or heritable disorder when 
the following are met.  
 
For ALL genetic testing, the condition being tested for must have either:  
• Reduced life expectancy OR  
• At least moderate-to-severe morbidity.
3
  
 
For the specific categories of testing, the following criteria must also be met:  
1. Testing of an affected (symptomatic) individual’s germline to benefit the individual 
(excluding reproductive testing)  
a. Diagnostic  
i. An association between the marker and the disorder has been 
established AND  

 
3 
ii. Symptoms of the disease are present AND  
iii. A definitive diagnosis cannot be made based on history, physical 
examination, pedigree analysis, and standard diagnostic studies/tests 
AND  
iv. The clinical utility of identifying the variant has been established  
1) Leads to changes in clinical management of the condition that 
improve outcomes OR  
2) Eliminates the need for further clinical workup or invasive testing 
OR  
3) Leads to discontinuation of interventions that are unnecessary 
and/or ineffective,  
b. Prognostic  
i. An association between the marker and the natural history of the 
disease has been established AND  
ii. Clinical utility of identifying the variant has been established  
1) Provides incremental prognostic information above that of 
standard testing AND  
2) Reclassifies patients into clinically relevant prognostic categories 
for which there are different treatment strategies AND  
3) Reclassification leads to changes in management that improve 
outcomes.  
c. Therapeutic  
i. Genetic testing identifies variants of a phenotype/metabolic state that 
relate to different pharmacokinetics, drug efficacy, or adverse drug 
reactions AND  
ii. Clinical utility of identifying the variant has been established  
1) Leads to initiation of effective medication(s) OR  
2) Leads to discontinuation of medications that are ineffective or 
harmful OR  
3) Leads to clinical meaningful change in dosing of medication that 
is likely to improve outcomes.  
2. Testing cancer cells of an affected individual to benefit the individual  
a. Diagnostic  
i. Genetic testing can establish the cell origin of a cancer when the origin 
is uncertain following standard workup AND  
ii. Clinical utility of identifying the variant has been established:  
1) Start effective treatment OR  
2) Discontinue ineffective or harmful treatment  
b. Prognostic  
i. An association between the marker and the natural history of the 
disease has been established AND  
ii. Clinical utility of identifying the variant has been established: 
1) Provides incremental prognostic information above that of 
standard testing AND  
2) Reclassifies patients into clinically relevant prognostic categories 
for which there are different treatment strategies AND  
3) Reclassification leads to changes in management that improve 
outcomes.  
c. Therapeutic  

 
4 
i. Association between a variant and treatment response to a particular 
drug has been established AND  
ii. Clinical utility has been established (see Appendix 2):  
1) The patient is a candidate for targeted drug therapy associated 
with a specific variant AND  
2) There is a clinically meaningful improvement in outcomes when 
targeted therapy is given for the condition.  
3. Testing an asymptomatic individual to determine future risk of disease  
i. An association between the marker and future disorder has been 
established AND  
ii. Clinical utility has been established:  
1) There is a presymptomatic phase for this disorder and 
interventions or surveillance are available AND  
2) Interventions in the presymptomatic phase are likely to improve 
outcomes:  
a. Prevent or delay onset of disease OR  
b. Detect disease at an earlier stage during which treatment is 
more effective OR  
c. Discontinuation of ineffective or unnecessary interventions.  
 
CLINICAL UTILITY CRITERIA  
For the following category, focusing on the benefit of testing for another individual, the 
definition of medical necessity may not apply. When an individual is tested to benefit a family 
member, and there is no benefit for the individual being tested, eligibility for coverage depends 
on individual plan benefit language. Individual plans may differ whether benefit structure allows 
testing of an individual to benefit an unaffected family member. 
 
For these reasons, the following criteria are considered for clinical utility of testing and not for 
medical necessity. 
4. Testing of an affected individual’s germline to benefit family members  
i. An association between the genetic variant and clinical disease has been 
established AND  
ii. Family members are available who may be at risk for the disorder AND  
iii. The individual tested has a clinical diagnosis of the condition (or represents 
the family member who is most likely to harbor the pathogenic variant), but 
genetic testing has not been performed AND  
iv. There is a presymptomatic phase for the disorder in which interventions are 
available AND  
v. Interventions in the presymptomatic phase are likely to improve outcomes in 
one of the following ways:  
1) Prevent or delay onset of disease;  
2) Detect disease at an earlier stage during which treatment is more 
effective;  
3) Discontinuation of interventions that are ineffective or unneeded.

LIMITATIONS OF GENETIC TESTING  
• The testing methods may not detect all variants that may occur in a gene.  
• Genetic testing may identify variants of uncertain significance.  
• Genetic testing may not necessarily determine the clinical outcome.  
• Different genes can cause the same disease (genetic heterogeneity).  
• A variant in a gene may cause different phenotypes (phenotypic heterogeneity).  
• Some disease-causing genes may not yet be identified.  
• Genetic testing is subject to laboratory error.  
 
SUMMARY OF EVIDENCE  
This conceptual framework addresses genetic testing in nonreproductive settings. Genetic 
testing in reproductive settings is addressed separately. For categories of genetic testing for 
which the benefit of testing is the individual, criteria for medical necessity apply. When the 
benefit of testing is not for the individual, but for a family member, medical necessity criteria 
may not apply, and the criteria are developed for clinical utility. 
 
SUPPLEMENTAL INFORMATION 
 
PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND POSITION STATEMENTS 
No guidelines or statements were identified. 
 
 
Government Regulations 
National: 
According to the Social Security Act of 1862(a)(1)(A) 
“Notwithstanding any other provision of this title, no payment may be made...for items or 
services - which, except for items and services described in a succeeding subparagraph, are 
not reasonable and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of illness or injury or to improve 
the functioning of a malformed body member.” This has been interpreted historically to prohibit 
payment for screening and prevention, unless Congress creates specific exceptions, which it 
has done periodically, e.g., for colorectal cancer screening. Thus, Medicare’s ability to 
consider payment for genomic services is currently limited to such uses that are neither 
screening nor preventive in nature. 
 
Medicare does not have a broad national coverage policy on genomic testing. Therefore, local 
Medicare contractors may make policies that apply only within their own jurisdictions. 
However, since many genomic tests are provided in a single location, i.e., all specimens are 
sent to a single laboratory, the decision of the local contractor having oversight of that 
laboratory has national implications. 
 
Medicare does not pay for preventive screening tests except for those specifically authorized by 
statute (e.g., prostate-specific antigen test). Since CMS considers predictive tests to be screening 
tests, genetic tests for this purpose are not covered by Medicare. However, genetic tests used to 
diagnose or determine treatment in the presence of signs and symptoms of disease can be 
covered by Medicare.
   
A common use of genetic tests in the Medicare population is to assist in 
determining cancer treatment. Genetic tests can be used to predict optimal chemotherapy 
regimens and avoid exposing patients to ineffective or overly toxic regimens. 
 
Medicare uses a combination of national and local coverage determinations for making 
coverage decisions for genetic tests. National coverage determinations (NCD) are made at the 

 
6 
Federal level and apply to all Medicare beneficiaries and Medicare administrative contractors 
(MAC). Currently, only two NCDs related to genetic tests have been established: (1) testing to 
predict patient responsiveness to the drug warfarin sodium, and (2) cytogenetic studies.
 
MACs 
make local coverage determinations (LCD), which apply only to beneficiaries in the 
contractor’s jurisdiction. Of the nearly 9,000 LCDs, only 11 are related to genetic tests. For 
example, one MAC covers BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic testing for beneficiaries who meet 
certain criteria.
 
 
 
Medicare National Coverage Determinations Manual, Section 190.3, Cytogenetic 
Studies; CIM 50-29, p 8-9: 
The term “cytogenetic studies” is used to describe the microscopic examination of the physical 
appearance of human chromosomes. Medicare covers these tests when they are reasonable 
and necessary for the diagnosis or treatment of the following conditions:  
• Genetic disorders (e.g., mongolism) in a fetus (See the Medicare Benefit Policy Manual, 
Chapter 15, “Covered Medical and Other Health Services,” §20.1  
• Failure of sexual development; or  
• Chronic myelogenous leukemia.  
• Acute leukemias lymphoid (FAB L1-L3), myeloid (FAB M0-M7), and unclassified; or  
• Myelodysplasia.  
 
Local:  
WPS GHA policy staff review and revise Local Coverage Determinations (LCDs) and Local 
Coverage Articles to ensure that all information remains accurate and up-to-date. When new 
LCDs and articles are created, and when current LCDs and articles are revised or retired, a 
summary of these updates is made available the WPS website.
