Title: Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells for 
Selecting Targeted Therapy for Advanced Solid Cancers 
(Liquid Biopsy) 
 
 
Description 
 
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood, referred 
to as "liquid biopsy," have several potential uses for guiding therapeutic decisions in individuals 
with cancer or being screened for cancer.  
 
 
 
Medical Policy Statement 
 
The use of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cells for selecting targeted therapy for 
advanced solid cancers is established when criteria are met.   
 
The use of circulating tumor DNA and circulating tumor cell testing is considered 
investigational for all other indications related to solid tumors, including measurable residual 
disease (MRD) testing and cancer screening (e.g., Galleri). There is insufficient evidence to 
determine that the technology results in an improvement in net health outcomes.

U.S. Food & Drug Administration – Companion Diagnostics 
A companion diagnostic is an FDA approved medical device, often an in vitro device, which 
provides information that is essential for the safe and effective use of a corresponding drug or 
biological product.(2) The test helps a health care professional determine whether, for a 
specific patient, a particular therapeutic product’s benefits outweigh any potential serious side 
effects or risks. 
Companion diagnostics can: 
• identify patients who are most likely to benefit from a particular therapeutic product; 
• identify patients likely to be at increased risk for serious side effects as a result of treatment 
with a particular therapeutic product; or 
• monitor response to treatment with a particular therapeutic product for the purpose of 
adjusting treatment to achieve improved safety or effectiveness. 
 
FDA-Approved Companion Diagnostic Tests 
FDA-approved companion diagnostic tests include: 
• Tests which are billed with CPT* codes (most laboratories are able to process these) 
• Proprietary laboratory analyses (PLA) tests (processed by one specific independent 
laboratory). Most PLA tests have billing codes that end in “U”.

Background 
 
Liquid Biopsy 

 
4 
 
Liquid biopsy refers to analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells 
(CTCs) as a method of noninvasively characterizing tumors and tumor genome from the 
peripheral blood.  
 
CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA  
Normal and tumor cells release small fragments of DNA into the blood, which is referred to as 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA). cfDNA from nonmalignant cells is released by apoptosis. Most cell-free 
tumor DNA is derived from apoptotic and/or necrotic tumor cells, either from the primary tumor, 
metastases, or CTCs.(1) Unlike apoptosis, necrosis is considered a pathologic process, and 
generates larger DNA fragments due to an incomplete and random digestion of genomic DNA. 
The length or integrity of the circulating DNA can potentially distinguish between apoptotic and 
necrotic origin. Circulating tumor DNA can be used for genomic characterization of the tumor.  
 
CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS  
Intact CTCs are released from a primary tumor and/or a metastatic site into the bloodstream. 
The half-life of a CTC in the bloodstream is short (1-2 hours), and CTCs are cleared through 
extravasation into secondary organs.(1) Most assays detect CTCs through the use of surface 
epithelial markers such as epithelial cell adhesion molecules (EpCAM) and cytokeratins. The 
primary reason for in detecting CTCs is prognostic, through quantification of circulating levels.  
 
DETECTING CTDNA AND CTCs  
Detection of ctDNA is challenging because ctDNA is diluted by nonmalignant circulating DNA 
and usually represents a small fraction (<1%) of total cfDNA. Therefore, more sensitive 
methods than the standard sequencing approaches (e.g., Sanger sequencing) are needed.  
Highly sensitive and specific methods have been developed to detect ctDNA, for both single-
nucleotide mutations (e.g. BEAMing [which combines emulsion polymerase chain reaction 
[PCR] with magnetic beads and flow cytometry] and digital PCR) and copy-number changes. 
Digital genomic technologies allow for enumeration of rare mutant variants in complex mixtures 
of DNA. 
 
Approaches to detecting ctDNA can be considered targeted, which includes the analysis of 
known genetic mutations from the primary tumor in a small set of frequently occurring driver 
mutations, which can impact therapy decisions (e.g., EGFR and ALK in non-small-cell lung 
cancer), or untargeted without knowledge of specific mutations present in the primary tumor, 
and include array comparative genomic hybridization, next-generation sequencing, and whole 
exome and genome sequencing.  
 
CTC assays usually start with an enrichment step that increases the concentration of CTCs, 
either on the basis of biologic properties (expression of protein markers) or physical properties 
(size, density, electric charge). CTCs can then be detected using immunologic, molecular, or 
functional assays.(1) 
 
Summary of Evidence  
 
Although there is limited evidence regarding the clinical utility of circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) and circulating tumor cell testing in individuals with cancer, this testing may help to 
determine eligibility for selecting FDA approved targeted cancer treatments for advanced solid 
cancers. Therefore, this testing may be considered established when policy criteria are met. 
 

 
5 
 
There is not enough research to show that plasma-based testing for variants in circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) to select targeted treatment improves health outcomes when policy 
criteria are not met. This includes ctDNA testing as an adjunct to, or replacement for tumor 
tissue testing, when tumor tissue is possible, or testing when there is no FDA-approved 
targeted treatment for the indication. Plasma-based ctDNA testing is generally less sensitive 
than tumor tissue testing and may identify changes that are not associated with the tumor 
Therefore, this testing is considered investigational when medical necessity criteria are not 
met.  
 
There is not enough research to show that testing for circulating tumor/cell-free DNA (ctDNA 
or cfDNA) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for purposes other than targeted treatment 
selection can improve overall health outcomes for people with solid tumors. Various ctDNA 
and CTC tests have been proposed to detect the presence or recurrence of solid tumor 
cancers. However, the impact such testing on health outcomes has not been clearly 
demonstrated in prospective studies. In addition, no clinical practice guidelines based on 
research recommended routine use of this type of testing in patient management. Therefore, 
CTC and ctDNA testing that is not for the purpose of selecting a targeted treatment is 
considered investigational. 
 
Rationale 
 
Evidence reviews assess the clinical evidence to determine whether the use of a technology 
improves the net health outcome. Broadly defined, health outcomes are length of life, quality of 
life, and ability to function including benefits and harms. Every clinical condition has specific 
outcomes that are important to individuals and to managing the course of that condition. 
Validated outcome measures are necessary to ascertain whether a condition improves or 
worsens; and whether the magnitude of that change is clinically significant. The net health 
outcome is a balance of benefits and harms. The following is a summary of the key literature to 
date. 
 
SELECTING TREATMENT IN ADVANCED SOLID CANCERS  
 
Treatment selection is informed by tumor type, grade, stage, individual performance status and 
preference, prior treatments, and the molecular characteristics of the tumor such as the 
presence of driver mutations. One purpose of liquid biopsy testing of individuals who have 
advanced cancer is to inform a decision regarding treatment selection (e.g., whether to select 
a targeted treatment or standard treatment). 
 
Liquid biopsies are easier to obtain and less invasive than tissue biopsies. True-positive liquid 
biopsy test results lead to the initiation of appropriate treatment (e.g., targeted therapy) without 
tissue biopsy. False-positive liquid biopsy test results lead to the initiation of inappropriate 
therapy, which could shorten progression-free survival. 
 
In individuals able to undergo tissue biopsy, negative liquid biopsies reflex to tissue testing. In 
individuals unable to undergo tissue biopsy, a negative liquid biopsy result would not change 
empirical treatment. Therefore, health outcomes related to negative test results do not differ 
between liquid biopsy and tissue biopsy. 
 
 

 
6 
 
 
Circulating Tumor DNA  
 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists jointly 
convened an expert panel to review the current evidence on the use of ctDNA assays.(3) The 
literature review included a search for publications on the use of ctDNA assays for solid tumors 
in March 2017 and covers several different indications for the use of liquid biopsy. The search 
identified 1338 references to which an additional 31 references were supplied by the expert 
panel. Seventy-seven articles were selected for inclusion. The summary findings are discussed 
in the following sections, by indication.  
 
Merker (2018) concluded that while a wide range of ctDNA assays have been developed to 
detect driver mutations, there is limited evidence of the clinical validity of ctDNA analysis in 
tumor types outside of lung cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC).(3)  
 
 
Since the end date of the searches conducted by Merker (2018), a number of observational 
studies have been published for various ctDNA tests. For example, two observational studies 
of the clinical validity of FoundationOne® Liquid (formerly FoundationACT®) in patients with 
various cancers compared liquid biopsy to tissue biopsy with FoundationOne® comprehensive 
genomic testing.(4, 5)
 Additional studies have assessed the validity of other tests, including the 
Guardant360 test (6,7) and OncoBEAM™ CRC assay(8-12). Given the breadth of molecular 
diagnostic methodologies available to assess ctDNA, the clinical validity of each commercially 
available test must be established independently. Multiple high-quality studies are needed to 
establish the clinical validity of a test. 
 
Direct evidence of clinical utility is provided by studies that have compared health outcomes for 
individuals managed with and without the test. Because these are intervention studies, the 
preferred evidence would be from randomized controlled trials. Merker (2018) concluded that 
no such trials have been reported for ctDNA tests.(3)
 
 
MONITORING TREATMENT RESPONSE IN CANCER 
  
Monitoring of treatment response in cancer may be performed using tissue biopsy or imaging 
methods. Another proposed purpose of liquid biopsy testing in patients who have advanced 
cancer is to monitor treatment response, which could allow for changing therapy before clinical 
progression and potentially improve outcomes.  
 
Circulating Tumor DNA  
Merker et al (2018) identified several proof-of-principle studies demonstrating correlations 
between changes in ctDNA levels and tumor response or outcomes as well as studies 
demonstrating that ctDNA can identify the emergence of resistance variants.(3) However, they 
reported a lack of rigorous, prospective validation studies of ctDNA-based monitoring and 
concluded that clinical validity had not been established. Additionally, the authors concluded 
that there is no evidence that changing treatment before clinical progression, at the time of 
ctDNA progression, improves patient outcomes. Therefore, no inferences can be made about 
clinical utility. 
 
 

 
7 
 
Circulating Tumor Cells  
Systematic reviews and meta-analyses describing an association between CTCs and poor 
prognosis have been reported for metastatic breast cancer,(12-15) CRC,(16,17) hepatocellular 
cancer,(18) prostate cancer,(19-21) head and neck cancer,(22) and melanoma.(23)  
 
The clinical validity of each commercially available CTC test must be established 
independently, which has not been done to date.  
 
PREDICTING RISK OF RELAPSE  
 
Monitoring for relapse after curative therapy in individuals with cancer may be performed using 
imaging methods and clinical examination. Another proposed purpose of liquid biopsy testing 
in    individuals who have cancer is to detect and monitor for residual tumor, which could lead to 
early treatment that would eradicate residual disease and potentially improve outcomes.  
 
Circulating Tumor DNA  
Merker et al (2018) identified several proof-of-principle studies demonstrating an association 
between persistent detection of ctDNA after local therapy and high risk of relapse.(3) However, 
current studies are retrospective and have not systematically confirmed that ctDNA is being 
detected before the metastatic disease has developed. They concluded that the performance 
characteristics had not been established for any assays. 
 
Chidambaram et al (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical 
utility of circulating tumor DNA testing in esophageal cancer.(24) Four retrospective studies 
(N=233, N range 35 to 97) provided data to assess ctDNA for monitoring for recurrence after 
treatment. The pooled sensitivity was 48.9% (range, 29.4% to 68.8%) and specificity was 
95.5% (range, 90.6% to 97.9%). 
 
Circulating Tumor Cells  
Rack et al (2014) published results of a large multicenter study in which CTCs were analyzed 
in 2026 patients with early breast cancer before adjuvant chemotherapy and in 1492 patients 
after chemotherapy using the CellSearch System.(25) After chemotherapy, 22% of patients 
were CTC-positive, and CTC positivity was negatively associated with prognosis.  
Smaller studies demonstrating associations between persistent CTCs and relapse have been 
published in prostate cancer,(26) CRC,(27) bladder cancer,(28,29) liver cancer,(30) and 
esophageal cancer.(31)  
 
Merker et al (2018) concluded that there is no evidence that early treatment before relapse, 
based on changes in ctDNA, improves patient outcomes.(3) Similarly, no trials were identified 
demonstrating that treatment before relapse based on changes in CTCs improves patient 
outcomes.  
 
SCREENING FOR CANCER IN ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS  
 
It has also been proposed that liquid biopsies could be used to screen asymptomatic 
individuals for early detection of cancer, which could allow for initiating treatment at an early 
stage, potentially improving outcomes.  
 

 
8 
 
For individuals who are being screened for cancer who receive multicancer early detection 
(MCED) testing with Galleri, the evidence is insufficient to determine that the technology 
results in an improvement in the net health outcome. No clinical utility studies have been 
published; estimates of changes in cancer-specific mortality, quality of life, functional outcomes 
and rates of overdiagnosis and overtreatment are unknown. 
 
Circulating Tumor DNA  
Merker et al (2018) reported that there is no evidence of clinical validity for the use of ctDNA in 
asymptomatic individuals.(3) 
  
Circulating Tumor Cells  
Systematic reviews with meta-analyses have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CTCs in 
patients with gastric and bladder/urothelial cancer.(32,33) Reported sensitivity was low in both 
cancers (42% and 35%) overall. Sensitivity was lower in patients with early-stage cancer, 
suggesting that the test would not be useful as an initial screen.

PRACTICE GUIDELINES AND POSITION STATEMENTS  
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology 
In 2022, the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) published a Provisional Clinical 
Opinion on somatic genetic testing in individuals with metastatic or advanced cancer.(34) The 
Opinion addressed cfDNA testing under additional topics but did not include a specific 
statement with a strength of recommendation rating. The panel noted, "There is a growing 
body of evidence on the clinical utility of genomic testing on cfDNA in the plasma," citing the 
systematic review conducted by Merker et al (2018) (3) The panel also noted that ASCO will 
update that systematic review over the next few years. 
 
The discussion also included the following points: 
 
• "In patients without tissue-based genomic test results, treatment may be based on 
actionable alterations identified in cfDNA." 
• "Testing is most helpful when genomic testing is indicated, archival tissue is 
unavailable, and new tumor biopsies are not feasible." 
• "cfDNA levels themselves may be prognostic and early cfDNA dynamics may serve as 
an early predictor of therapy response or resistance." 
• "Ongoing studies are expected to better delineate the clinical utility of serial liquid 
biopsies."

Regulatory Status 
 
Clinical laboratories may develop and validate tests in-house and market them as a laboratory 
service; laboratory-developed tests (LDTs) must meet the general regulatory standards of the 
Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA). Laboratories that offer LDTs must be 
licensed by CLIA for high-complexity testing. To date, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration 
(FDA) has chosen not to require any regulatory review of this test.  
  
Information regarding FDA-approved companion diagnostic tests should be obtained from the 
FDA “List of Cleared or Approved Companion Diagnostic Devices (In Vitro and Imaging Tools)” 
website. https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/in-vitro-diagnostics/list-cleared-or-approved-

Coverage Indications Limitations and/or Medical Necessity 
This is a coverage policy for the CellSearch (Veridex) circulating tumor cell (CTC) assay. All 
other methods for circulating tumor cell detection, including reverse-transcription polymerase 
chain reaction PCR (RTPCR) Assays, are non-covered. 
 
CTCs represent the point in the metastatic process of solid tumors when cells from a primary 
tumor invade, detach, disseminate, colonize and proliferate in a distant site. Detection of 
elevated CTCs during therapy is an accurate indication of subsequent rapid disease 
progression and mortality in breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. Therefore, CTC will be 
limited to metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer. CTC testing for all other malignant 
diagnoses will be denied as not reasonable and necessary. 
 
The CellSearch assay, an independent predictor of progression-free survival and overall 
survival in patients with metastatic breast, colorectal and prostate cancer, involves the 
automated immunomagnetic selection of CTCs based on an anti-EpCAM antibody cell capture. 
To perform this assay, a 7.5 ml aliquot of blood is incubated with EpCAM antibody-covered 
ferroparticles (nanotechnology). Circulating epithelial cells that express EpCAM are isolated in 
a magnetic field without centrifugation.  
 
The supernatant containing unbound cells is removed. The enriched cell samples are labeled 
with a fluorescent nuclei acid dye and two monoclonal antibodies (CD 45 and Cytokeratin 8, 
18, 19), each tagged with distinct fluorescent compounds. The stained cells are then analyzed 
on a fluorescence microscope. Digital fluorescent images are screened by a qualified 
technician for CTCs; the cell has a nucleus, expresses keratin (EpCAM and CK) and does not 
express CD45.  
 
The assay findings are verified by a pathologist and issued in a report as a numerical result 
where more than 5 cells per 7.5 ml of whole blood predicts worse prognosis in patients with 
known recurrent breast and prostate cancer, and more than 3 cells are predictive of shorter 
progression free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in metastatic colorectal cancer.  
 
Utilization Guidelines  
Services performed for excessive frequency are not medically necessary. Patients should be 
treated on an individual basis as indicated by the response to treatment. The intent of the 
following guidelines is to provide the maximum amount of tests required to adequately follow 
disease progression or treatment response.  
 
WPS Medicare expects physicians to limit CTC testing to only times when the CTC information 
may change treatment. Documentation maintained in the patient record must support medical 
necessity and be available upon request.  

 
12 
 
 
 
Frequency: 
 
• Baseline – limited to once prior to initiation of tumor-type specific chemotherapy 
 
• Follow-up during chemotherapy treatment - repeat every 4-6 weeks 
 
• Surveillance with no chemotherapy treatments - repeat every 4-6 months 
 
A rapid rise in the CTC value usually indicates aggressive disease and impending adverse 
outcome. WPS Medicare would expect to see no further CTC testing after the transition to 
palliative/hospice care.

FDA-Approved Companion 
Diagnostic Tests 
FDA-approved companion diagnostic 
tests include: 
• Tests which are billed with CPT* 
codes (most laboratories are able 
to process these) 
• Proprietary laboratory analyses 
(PLA) tests (processed by one 
specific independent laboratory). 
Most PLA tests have billing codes 
that end in “U”.  
*CPT® is a registered trademark of 
the American Medical Association

Proprietary Laboratory Analyses 
(PLA) Testing 
A PLA test is considered established 
when the following criteria are met:  
• Biomarker confirmation is 
required by an FDA-approved 
or -cleared test prior to 
initiating treatment (as 
described in the FDA 
prescribing label of the 
therapeutic in the section 
“Indications and Usage”), 
AND 
• The test is an FDA-approved 
companion diagnostic  
Information regarding FDA-
approved companion 
diagnostic tests should be
