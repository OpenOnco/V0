Date of Last Revision: 02/22 Revision Log 
See Important Reminder  at the end of this  policy for  important  regulatory and legal  
information.  
Description 
Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) originates directly from the tumor tissue (primary or 
metastasis); as tumor cells die the contents are released into the bloodstream.  Genetic tests 
performed on cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), also referred to as a liquid biopsy, 
potentially offer a noninvasive alternative to tissue biopsy for detection of “driver mutations”, or 
acquired genetic mutations that may guide targeted therapy, and may also be used to track 
progression of disease. 
Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are intact tumor cells that are shed from tumor cells into the 
bloodstream or lymphatic system. Most assays detect CTCs through the use of surface epithelial 
markers such as EpCAM and cytokeratins. The primary reason for detecting CTCs is prognostic 
rather than for guiding therapeutic choices, through quantification of circulating levels.

Notes and Definitions 
Cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is fragmented, tumor-derived DNA circulating in 
the bloodstream that is not being carried in a cell. ctDNA derives either directly from the tumor 
or from circulating tumor cells. 
Circulating Tumor Cells (CTCs) are intact cells that have shed into the bloodstream or 
lymphatic system from a primary tumor or a metastasis site, and are carried around the body by 
blood circulation. 
Cell   -free circulating tumor DNA analysis should not be used in lieu of a histologic tissue 
diagnosis, however there are specific clinical considerations, outlined above, where the use of 
ctDNA may be considered. 
Cell-free circulating tumor DNA analysis should not be performed simultaneously with tissue 
testing of a solid tumor. 
If cell-free circulating tumor DNA analysis is negative, follow-up with tissue-based analysis is 
recommended. 
Background 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN): 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.4.2021) support the use of cell-free circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) testing if 
a patient is either not medically fit for invasive tissue sampling, or if there is insufficient tissue for 
molecular analysis. If ctDNA testing is negative, there should be follow-up with tissue-based 
analysis. NCCN recognizes that studies have shown generally high sensitivity, but a significantly 
compromised sensitivity with up to 30% false-negative rate and does not support the use of ctDNA 
testing in lieu of a histologic tissue diagnosis, if it is possible and feasible. 
Prostate Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.1.2022) suggest the consideration of AR-V7 tests to help guide selection of 
therapy for patients with disease progression in the post-abiraterone/enzalutamide metastatic 
castration resistant prostate cancer setting.

CLINICAL POLICY 
Oncology Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells (Liquid Biopsy) 
NCCN guidelines (v.1.2022) strongly advocates evaluating tumor for alterations in homologous 
recombination DNA repair genes in individuals with metastatic prostate cancer and states that 
ctDNA assay is an option when biopsy for histologic and molecular evaluation is not possible. 
Colorectal Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.3.2021) state that there is insufficient data to recommend the use of 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) for patients with colorectal cancer to estimate the risk of 
recurrence or to determine adjuvant therapy. The NCCN Panel encourages enrollment in clinical 
trials in order to aide in generation of additional data for these assays. 
Melanoma 
NCCN guidelines (v.2.2021) do not currently have a recommendation for the use of circulating 
tumor DNA (ctDNA) for patients with melanoma. 
Breast Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.2.2021) states that PIK3CA mutation testing can be done on tumor tissue or 
ctDNA in peripheral blood (liquid biopsy) and if liquid biopsy is negative, tumor tissue testing is 
recommended. 
NCCN guidelines (v.2.2021) recognize that patients with metastatic breast cancer and persistently 
increased CTC after 3 weeks of first-line chemotherapy have a poor PFS and OS; however, while 
CTC count has prognostic ability, it has failed to show a predictive value at this time. 
Gastric Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.2.2021) recognize the use of liquid biopsy in patients with advanced disease 
who are unable to have a clinical biopsy for disease surveillance or management, and that the DNA 
shed from gastric carcinomas can identify targetable alterations or the evolution of clone with 
altered treatment response profiles. NCCN also cautions the interpretation of negative results, as it 
does not exclude the presence of tumor mutation or amplifications that are clinically relevant. 
Pancreatic Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.2.2021) state that while testing of tumor tissue is preferred, cell-free DNA 
testing can be considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible. 
Esophageal or Esophagogastric Junction Cancer 
NCCN guidelines (v.2.2021) recognize the use of liquid biopsy in patients with advanced disease 
who are unable to have a clinical biopsy for disease surveillance or management, and that the DNA 
shed from esophageal and EGJ carcinomas can identify targetable alterations or the evolution of 
clone with altered treatment response profiles. NCCN also cautions the interpretation of negative 
results, as it does not exclude the presence of tumor mutation or amplifications that are clinically 
relevant. 
American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists (2018) 
published a joint review on the use of circulating tumor DNA analysis in patients with cancer, 
concluding the following:

CLINICAL POLICY 
Oncology Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells (Liquid Biopsy) 
“The evidence indicates that testing for ctDNA is  optimally performed on  plasma  
collected in cell stabilization or EDTA tubes, with EDTA tubes processed within 6 hours  
of collection. Some ctDNA assays have demonstrated clinical validity and utility with  
certain types of  advanced cancer; however, there is insufficient evidence of clinical  
validity and utility for the majority of ctDNA  assays in advanced cancer. Evidence shows  
discordance between the  results of ctDNA  assays  and genotyping tumor specimens and 
supports tumor tissue genotyping to confirm undetected results from  ctDNA tests. There  
is no evidence of  clinical utility and little evidence of clinical validity of ctDNA assays in  
early-stage cancer, treatment monitoring, or residual disease detection. There is no  
evidence of clinical validity and clinical utility to  suggest that ctDNA assays are useful 
for cancer screening, outside of a clinical trial. Given the rapid pace of research,  re-
evaluation of the literature will shortly be required, along with the development of tools  
and guidance for clinical practice.”  
The ASCO (2016) made the following guideline in regard to the use of biomarkers to guide 
decisions on adjuvant systemic therapy for women with early-stage invasive breast cancer: 
“The clinician should not use circulating tumor cells to guide decisions on adjuvant 
systemic therapy. Type: evidence based. Evidence quality: intermediate. Strength of 
recommendation: strong.” 
College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, 
and the Association for Molecular Pathology 
The College of American Pathologists, the International Association for the Study of Lung 
Cancer, and the Association for Molecular Pathology (2018) published a guideline on molecular 
testing for the selection of lung cancer patients for treatment with targeted tyrosine kinase 
inhibitors and noted the following recommendations regarding liquid biopsy for activating EGFR 
mutations and a consensus opinion regarding liquid biopsy for the T790M resistance mutation: 
● Recommendation: "In some clinical settings in which tissue is limited and/or insufficient 
for molecular testing, physicians may use a cfDNA assay to identify [activating] EGFR 
mutations." 
● Expert Consensus Opinion: "Physicians may use plasma cfDNA methods to identify 
EGFR T790M mutations in lung adenocarcinoma patients with progression or secondary 
clinical resistance to EGFR targeted TKIs; testing of the tumor sample is recommended if 
the plasma result is negative." 
● No recommendation: "There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of 
circulating tumor cell molecular analysis for the diagnosis of primary lung 
adenocarcinoma, the identification of EGFR or other mutations, or the identification of 
EGFR T790M mutations at the time of EGFR TKI resistance." 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
Cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2: 
“On June 1, 2016, the U. S. Food and Drug Administration approved cobas EGFR Mutation Test

CLINICAL POLICY 
Oncology Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells (Liquid Biopsy) 
growth factor receptor (EGFR) gene to identify patients with metastatic non-small cell lung 
cancer (NSCLC) eligible for treatment with Tarceva® (erlotinib).  The cobas EGFR Mutation 
Test v2 is already approved for this indication using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) 
tissue specimens.  The new use is for detection of these specific mutations in circulating-free 
tumor DNA (cfDNA) isolated from plasma specimens, also called liquid biopsy specimens, to 
aid physicians in identifying patients who may be treated first with TARCEVA (erlotinib).  This 
is the first “liquid biopsy test” approved for use by FDA. This new test may benefit patients who 
may be too ill or are otherwise unable to provide a tumor specimen for EGFR testing.  Patients 
positive by cobas EGFR Mutation Test v2 using plasma specimens for the presence of EGFR 
exon 19 deletions or L858R mutations are candidates for treatment with Tarceva (erlotinib). 
Patients who are negative by this test should undergo routine biopsy and testing for EGFR 
mutations with the FFPE tissue sample type.”

Important Reminder 
This clinical policy has been developed by appropriately experienced and licensed health care 
professionals based on a review and consideration of currently available generally accepted standards of 
medical practice; peer-reviewed medical literature; government agency/program approval status; 
evidence-based guidelines and positions of leading national health professional organizations; views of 
physicians practicing in relevant clinical areas affected by this clinical policy; and other available clinical 
information. The Health Plan makes no representations and accepts no liability with respect to the content 
of any external information used or relied upon in developing this clinical policy. This clinical policy is 
consistent with standards of medical practice current at the time that this clinical policy was approved. 
“Health Plan” means a health plan that has adopted this clinical policy and that is operated or 
administered, in whole or in part, by Centene Management Company, LLC, or any of such health plan’s 
affiliates, as applicable. 
The purpose of this clinical policy is to provide a guide to medical necessity, which is a component of the 
guidelines used to assist in making coverage decisions and administering benefits. It does not constitute a 
contract or guarantee regarding payment or results. Coverage decisions and the administration of benefits 
are subject to all terms, conditions, exclusions and limitations of the coverage documents (e.g., evidence 
of coverage, certificate of coverage, policy, contract of insurance, etc.), as well as to state and federal 
requirements and applicable Health Plan-level administrative policies and procedures. 
This clinical policy is effective as of the date determined by the Health Plan. The date of posting may not 
be the effective date of this clinical policy. This clinical policy may be subject to applicable legal and 
regulatory requirements relating to provider notification. If there is a discrepancy between the effective 
date of this clinical policy and any applicable legal or regulatory requirement, the requirements of law and 
regulation shall govern. The Health Plan retains the right to change, amend or withdraw this clinical 
policy, and additional clinical policies may be developed and adopted as needed, at any time. 
This clinical policy does not constitute medical advice, medical treatment or medical care. It is not 
intended to dictate to providers how to practice medicine. Providers are expected to exercise professional 
medical judgment in providing the most appropriate care, and are solely responsible for the medical 
advice and treatment of member/enrollees. This clinical policy is not intended to recommend treatment 
for member/enrollees. Member/enrollees should consult with their treating physician in connection with 
diagnosis and treatment decisions. 
Providers referred to in this clinical policy are independent contractors who exercise independent 
judgment and over whom the Health Plan has no control or right of control. Providers are not agents or 
employees of the Health Plan.
