INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. 
Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients 
and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and 
coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide 
guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please 
note, the terms of a customer’s particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, 
Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan 
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage 
Policies are based. For example, a customer’s benefit plan document may contain a specific 
exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer’s 
benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence 
of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the 
terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance 
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date 
of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including 
Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request 
should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment 
where appropriate and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Where 
coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances, reimbursement will only 
be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria outlined 
in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). 
Reimbursement is not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not 
covered under this Coverage Policy (see “Coding Information” below). When billing, providers 

Page 2   of    21   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date of the submission. Claims submitted 
for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable Coverage Policy will 
be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health 
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used 
as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support 
medical necessity and other coverage determinations. 
 
Overview 
 
This Coverage Policy addresses testing for harmful or likely harmful changes in the genetic 
information of cells that occur in the egg or sperm cell at conception. These changes, also called 
variants,  are inherited or passed down through generations by blood relatives. The changes may 
increase a person’s risk or tendency to have a certain disease or disorder. When a combination of 
gene changes and other factors influence whether or not a condition results in a trait or health 
condition, it is known as multifactorial. Examples of factors other than genes are lifestyle, smoking 
and the environment. 
 
Several types of testing are discussed in this Coverage Policy, including testing for a single change 
in a gene or part of a gene and testing for multiple changes in a gene or genes. Also discussed are 
tests that measure how a gene is turned on or off, which is referred to as gene expression. 
 
Coverage Policy 
 
Coverage for genetic testing varies across plans. Refer to the customer’s benefit plan 
document for coverage details. 
 
Note:  
If coverage for genetic testing is available and disease-  or condition-specific criteria for 
genetic testing are not outlined in a separate policy or guideline, the following criteria 
apply.  
 
Laboratory Testing 
 
Laboratory testing, including genetic testing (proprietary or non-proprietary, individual 
test or panel) is considered medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are 
met: 
 
• The proposed test or each proposed test in a panel is Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-
approved and/or performed in a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-
accredited laboratory.  
• The proposed test or each proposed test in a panel is medically necessary for the 
diagnosis(es)/indication(s) listed. 
• Results of the proposed test or each proposed test in a panel will directly impact clinical 
decision making. 
 
For an out-of  -network request to be covered at an in-network benefit level, the proposed test or 
each proposed test in a panel must not be available from an in-network laboratory for the 
indication(s) or diagnoses listed.

is considered scientifically valid for identification of a genetically-linked heritable disease 
and is the most appropriate method unless technical limitations (e.g., poor quality sample) 
necessitate the need for alternate testing strategies. 
• If testing guidelines exist, the clinical scenario falls within those recommendations. 
• The clinical benefit of testing outweighs the potential risk of psychological or medical harm 
to the individual being tested.

documented 
• test results may preclude the need for multiple and/or invasive procedures or tests, follow-
up, or screening that would be recommended in the absence of panel testing 
 
Genetic testing for multifactorial diseases using panels, gene expression classifiers, or 
polygenic risk scores is considered medically necessary when EITHER of the following 
conditions is met: 
 
• individual demonstrates signs/symptoms of a multifactorial disease 
• individual has a direct risk factor (e.g., based on family history or pedigree analysis) for the 
development of a multifactorial disease 
 
And ALL of the following are met:

Health Equity Considerations 
 
Health equity is the highest level of health for all people; health inequity is the avoidable 
difference in health status or distribution of health resources due to the social conditions in which 
people are born, grow, live, work, and age.  
 
Social determinants of health are the conditions in the environment that affect a wide range of 
health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. Examples include safe housing, 
transportation, and neighborhoods; racism, discrimination and violence; education, job 
opportunities and income; access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities; access to 
clean air and water; and language and literacy skills. 
 
Significant disparities in the clinical usefulness of genomic information across diverse groups are 
due to underrepresentation in genetic databases and inequitable access to genetic services. 
According to some estimates, over 80% of genome datasets originate from people of European 
ancestry, with many ancestries not well represented. If individuals across diverse ancestries are 
not included in sufficient numbers in studies, there likely will be insufficient power to identify 
genetic variants that are observed exclusively or predominantly in one ancestral group. As a result 
of these limitations, variants in ancestral groups that are insufficiently represented in disease and 
reference genomic datasets are more likely to be classified as variants of uncertain significance 
(VUSs) (Lee,  et al., 2022). 
 
General Background 
 
Laboratory Testing 
 
Some general principles apply to reimbursement of all laboratory tests. The testing method being 
used must be scientifically validated for each indication for which the test or panel is being 
proposed. Due to the high complexity of genetic tests, the proposed test or each proposed test in 
a panel must be Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-approved and/or performed in a Clinical 
Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA)-accredited laboratory. There are several important 
advantages to a test being CLIA certified, including the test having a higher degree of precision 
and performance by trained laboratory professionals. Tests performed in CLIA-accredited 
laboratories must meet regulatory CLIA standards. The results of each individual test or each test 

Page 5   of    21   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
in a panel must be clinically useful for the diagnoses or indications for which the test is being 
performed. Further, outcomes must be meaningful, that is, they must directly impact clinical 
decision making and result in improved outcomes for the individual being tested. 
 
Genetic Testing 
 
Disease can result when there is an alteration or pathogenic variant in a DNA sequence which 
causes the cell to produce the wrong protein, or too much or too little of the correct protein. When 
the pathogenic variant occurs in an egg or sperm it is referred to as a germline variant. Germline 
gene variants are inherited; that is, passed down in families by blood relatives. 
 
Some conditions, such as sickle cell disease, are caused by a single germline pathogenic variant. 
Other conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, are more complex. These complex 
conditions are referred to as multifactorial conditions. Multifactorial conditions are also inherited, 
but may be caused by more than one germline pathogenic variant. The presence of a pathogenic 
variant(s) may increase an individual's risk of developing one of these conditions; however, a 
combination of genetic and environmental factors such as nutrition, exercise, weight, smoking, 
drinking alcohol, and medication use may influence the observable characteristics of the condition. 
 
Genetic testing involves the analysis of human deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA), ribonucleic acid 
(RNA), chromosomes, proteins, and certain metabolites in order to detect alterations or changes 
related to an inherited disorder. Types of genetic testing used to identify germline pathogenic 
variant(s) that cause hereditary and multifactorial conditions include single gene testing, targeted 
analysis, and multigene sequencing panels. The test must have clinical utility. Clinical utility refers 
to the usefulness of the test to impact health outcomes and treatment.  
 
The National Human Genome Research Institute Task Force on Genetic Testing (NHGRI) 
recommended the following underlying principles to ensure the safety and effectiveness of genetic 
tests (Holtzman and Watson, 1998): 
 
• The genotypes to be detected by a genetic test must be shown by scientifically valid 
methods to be associated with the occurrence of a disease, independently replicated and 
subject to peer review. 
• Analytical sensitivity and specificity of a genetic test must be determined before it is made 
available in clinical practice. 
• Data to establish the clinical validity of genetic tests (clinical sensitivity, specificity, and 
predictive value) must be collected under investigative protocols. In clinical validation, the 
study sample must be drawn from a group of subjects representative of the population for 
whom the test is intended. Formal validation for each intended use of a genetic test is 
needed. 
• Before a genetic test can be generally accepted in clinical practice, data must be collected 
to demonstrate the benefits and risks that accrue from both positive and negative results. 
 
Genetic testing may be used to aid in diagnosis or confirmation of a disorder in a symptomatic 
individual (i.e., diagnostic or confirmatory testing), to predict risk of future disease in an 
asymptomatic individual (i.e., predictive testing), to allow reproductive planning (i.e., reproductive 
carrier testing), prenatal testing of a fetus, preimplantation genetic diagnosis, and newborn 
screening. The scope of this policy includes diagnostic and confirmatory, single or multigene 
testing for hereditary and multifactorial conditions.  
 
Single Gene Genetic Testing for Germline Conditions 
 

Page 6 of    21   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
Single gene germline genetic testing is frequently performed to diagnose or confirm the presence 
of a disease-causing pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant and may be appropriate if an 
individual demonstrates characteristics of a genetically-linked heritable disease or has a direct risk 
factor for the development of the specific disease in question. Diagnostic testing may also be 
performed to help determine the course of a disease or choice of treatment. Genetic testing for a 
number of genetically linked heritable conditions is supported by various professional society 
guidelines. 
 
Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NAD(P)H) (MTHFR) Gene Variants 
Polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene have been associated with an increased risk of homocystinuria, 
and studied as a possible risk factor for a number of other conditions such as heart disease, 
stroke, preeclampsia, glaucoma, cleft palate, and certain psychiatric conditions. Increased levels 
of homocysteine have also been associated with an increased risk of thromboembolism (Genetics 
Home Reference [GHR], 2019). Although MTHFR has been associated with increased risk of 
homocystinuria; genetic testing is not indicated because these variants are not associated with 
thromboembolism (Hickey, et al., 2013). 
 
MTHFR variants have also been associated with an increased risk of neural tube defects, such as 
anencephaly or spina bifida. The 677C>T variant is the most commonly studied. This involves a 
change in a single deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) nucleotide in the MTHFR gene, which produces a 
form of MTHFR that has reduced activity at higher temperatures (i.e., thermolabile). Individuals 
with the thermolabile form of the enzyme have increased blood levels of homocysteine. It is 
estimated that over 25% of individuals of Hispanic origin and 10-15% of North American 
Caucasians are homozygous for this variant (Hickey, et al., 2013). 
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): The FDA has granted 510(k) clearance to several 
genomic DNA in vitro diagnostic tests for MTHFR mutation, including Invader MTHFR 677 and 
Invader MTHFR 1298 (Hologic, Inc., 2011, Marlborough, MA), eSensor MTHFR Genotyping Test 
(Osmetech Molecular Diagnostics, 2010, Pasadena, CA), and Verigene MTHFR Nucleic Acid Test 
(Nanosphere, Inc., 2007, Northbrook, IL). 
 
Literature Review: Although there are a number of observational studies in the published peer-
reviewed scientific literature regarding the association of MTHFR variants and increased risk of 
homocystinuria, neural tube defects and other conditions, randomized control data are limited. 
Evidence to demonstrate the impact of genotyping on improved health outcomes, including 
disease management, is also limited. 
 
Several variants of the MTHFR gene have been associated with increased risk of developing a 
number of conditions; however, its role in these conditions has not been established (GHR, 2019; 
Hickey, et al., 2013). There is insufficient evidence in the published peer-reviewed scientific 
literature to determine the clinical utility of MTHFR genetic testing and its impact on net health 
outcomes. Professional society consensus support for MTHFR genotyping is limited. At this time 
the role of genetic testing for MTHFR has not been established. 
 
Tsai et al. (2009) reported results of a longitudinal cohort analysis of participants (n=1434) of the 
CARDIA study. DNA was extracted from the peripheral leukocytes of blood collected from each 
participant. MTHFR 677C.T genotype was determined using selective amplification. The mean of 
serum B vitamins and tHcy concentrations and the prevalence of folate deficiency and moderate 
hyperhomocysteinemia were compared in 844 Caucasian and 587 African American participants 
before folic acid fortification (year zero and year seven) and after fortification (year 15). 
Mandatory folic acid fortification as initiated by the U.S. government in 1998 improved the 
nutritional status of folate in both Caucasians and African Americans, with an approximate three-
fold increase in folate concentrations at year 15 compared with year zero. The authors used the 

Page 7 of    21   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
sensitivity and specificity of MTHFR 677C.T genotyping to predict elevated tHcy concentrations 
using various tHcy cutoffs to define hyperhomocysteinemia. The authors concluded that after folic 
acid fortification in the U.S., measurement of tHcy rather than genotyping of MTHFR 677TT should 
be used as the primary assay for the diagnosis and monitoring of moderate 
hyperhomocysteinemia. 
 
Apolipoprotein E (APOE) Gene Variants 
Genetic testing for apolipoprotein-E epsilon (APOE) testing has been proposed as a means to 
provide additional risk information for those patients currently identified as low- or intermediate-
risk for cardiovascular disease by standard lipoprotein testing and risk factor assessment. APOE 
controls the metabolism of the highly atherogenic apolipoprotein B (apo B) containing lipoproteins. 
It is a protein constituent of VLDL and chylomicrons. The APOE gene provides instructions for 
making Apo E; Apo E binds to the cell surface receptors to form molecules called lipoproteins. 
However, there is no uniform standard for analyzing the relationship of APOE genotypes or 
phenotypes to cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk. At this time, genotype-phenotype correlations 
are incompletely understood (Bird, 2018). 
 
Genetic testing for APOE has also been proposed as a means to diagnose or predict susceptibility 
to early- and late-onset Alzheimer's disease (AD). At least three different alleles of APOE epsilon 
have been identified: APOE epsilon-2 (APOE e2), APOE epsilon-3 (APOE e3) and APOE epsilon-4 
(APOE e4). APOE is a susceptibility polymorphism; the presence of one or two e4 alleles increases 
the risk but does not guarantee that someone will develop AD. Neuropathologic findings of beta-
amyloid plaques and intraneuronal neurofibrillary tangles on autopsy examination remain the gold 
standard for diagnosis of AD (Bird, 2018). Clinical diagnosis prior to autopsy confirmation is made 
by use of diagnostic testing. Recommendations by the National Institute of Neurological and 
Communicative Diseases and Stroke and the Alzheimer’s Disease and Related Disorders 
Association ([NINCDS-ADRDA]) criteria were published by McKhann et al. (2011), on behalf of the 
National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association. These criteria correctly diagnose the 
disease 80%-90% of the time. 
 
The role of APOE in late-onset AD is a topic of research interest. The APOE e4 genotype is found in 
many elderly persons without dementia and about 42% of persons with late-onset AD do not have 
an apolipoprotein-E (APOE) epsilon-4 allele. The absence of this allele does not rule out the 
diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease, however the association of the APOE e4 allele with AD is 
significant. Nevertheless, APOE genotyping is neither fully specific nor sensitive. Additional genes 
and loci under investigation include ABCA7, AKAP9, BIN1, CASS4, CD2AP, CD33, CLU, EPHA1, 
FERMT2, HLA-DRB5/DRB1, INPP5D, MEF2C, MS4A6A/MS4A4E, PICALM, PLD3, PTK2B, SORL1, and 
UNC5C (Bird, 2018). 
 
There is insufficient evidence in the peer-reviewed, scientific literature to support the use of APOE 
testing for the screening, diagnosis or management of cardiovascular disease or Alzheimer’s 
disease (AD). APOE genotyping does not reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease, 
change the clinical treatment, or substantially modify disease progression in individuals with 
Alzheimer’s disease. 
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): In 2020, the FDA granted 510(k) clearance for the 
over-the-counter, direct-to-consumer Helix Genetic Health Risk App for Late-Onset Alzheimer’s 
Disease (Helix OpCo, LLC, 2020, Toronto, Canada). The manufacturer claims that the test reports 
the lifetime risk of developing Alzheimer’s disease at or above age 65 years based on six 
genotypes of the APOE gene. The predicate test for this approval was the 23andMe PGS Genetic 
Health Risk Report for Late-onset Alzheimer’s Disease (23andMe, 2017, Sunnyvale, CA), which 
reported on the e4 variant only. Potential users of either test are advised that the tests are not 

Page 8 of    21   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
diagnostic, do not detect all genetic variants associated with late-onset Alzheimer’s disease, and 
that an individual’s race, ethnicity, age, and/or sex may affect result interpretation.  
 
Literature Review: The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) identified 15 cohort 
studies involving 8509 subjects that examined the association between APOE and the risk of 
cognitive decline. Various studies reported that APOE epsilon-4 (e4) was associated with greater 
decline on some, but not all, cognitive measures. Presence of an APOE e4 allele was not, however, 
significantly different in those who maintained cognitive performance compared to those with 
minor declines (Williams, et al., 2010). 
 
Tsuang et al. (1999) prospectively evaluated APOE testing for AD in a community-based case 
series of 132 persons with no previous diagnosis of dementia. Clinical diagnosis yielded a 
sensitivity of 84%, specificity of 50%, and positive and negative predictive values of 81% and 
56%, respectively. Neuropathologic AD was confirmed in 94 of 132 patients, with a prevalence of 
71%. The presence of an APOE epsilon-4 allele was associated with an estimated sensitivity of 
59%, specificity of 71%, and positive and negative predictive values of 83% and 41%, 
respectively. The authors noted that findings do not support the use of APOE genotyping alone in 
the diagnosis of AD in the general medical community. In a neuropathologically confirmed series, 
the addition of APOE testing increased the positive predictive value of a diagnosis of AD from 90% 
to 94%. In those patients with a clinical diagnosis of non-Alzheimer’s dementia the absence of an 
APOE e4 allele increased the negative predictive value from 64% to 72% (Waldemar, 2007). 
 
Gene Expression Profiling for Cardiovascular Disease Risk: Gene expression is a process by 
which a gene's coded information is translated into the structures present and operating in the cell 
and has been investigated as a diagnostic tool for evaluating individuals with cardiovascular 
disease. 
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA): While many genetic and genomic tests are 
regulated by the FDA, laboratory developed tests (i.e., in vitro diagnostic tests that are designed, 
manufactured and used within a single laboratory) go to market without independent analysis. 
One such example was the Corus CAD Assay from CardioDx Inc. (Palo Alto, CA), which was 
proposed as a quantitative gene expression test intended to rule out coronary artery disease 
(CAD) in stable, nondiabetic individuals. The test is no longer commercially available. 
 
Literature Review: Although there are some data in the published, peer-reviewed scientific 
literature evaluating risk factors as a method of assessing cardiovascular disease, the added value 
beyond that associated with traditional testing has not been firmly established. Consensus support 
from professional societies/organizations in the form of published guidelines is lacking. The impact 
of genetic testing on meaningful clinical outcomes such as morbidity and mortality has not yet 
been clearly defined. 
 
Evidence in the published peer-reviewed scientific literature evaluating gene expression testing for 
determining cardiovascular disease risk (e.g., Corus CAD) is limited to prospective validation 
studies and case control studies (Filsoof, et al., 2015; Ladapo, et al., 2015; Daniels, et al., 2014; 
McPherson, et al., 2013; Thomas, et al., 2013; Vargas, et al., 2013; Lansky, et al., 2012; 
Rosenberg, et al., 2012; Elashoff, et al., 2011; Rosenberg, et al., 2010; Wingrove, et al., 2008). 
Wingrove et al. (2008) and Elashoff et al. (2011) evaluated genes associated with CAD as part of 
the development of the gene expression assay algorithm for assessing CAD in nondiabetic 
patients.  
 
Herman et al. (2014) published the results of a prospective clinical trial (n=261) to evaluate the 
impact of GES testing on reduction of diagnostic uncertainty in the evaluation of subjects 
presenting with symptoms suggestive of obstructive CAD. The trial is referred to as the “Primary 

Page 9 of    21   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
Care Providers Use of a Gene Expression Test in Coronary Artery Disease Diagnosis (IMPACT-
PCP)" trial. Subjects were nondiabetic patients presenting with stable, nonacute typical and 
atypical symptoms of obstructive CAD. Ten subjects were excluded, primarily due to GES 
exclusion criteria. Preliminary clinical decisions without GES results were made by the primary 
care physician and compared to final decisions made with the GES results. Primary outcomes 
included the change in patient management between preliminary and final decisions; secondary 
outcomes included assessment of the pattern of change for each patient, including the effect the 
change had on patient outcomes. The average pretest probability of obstructive CAD was 28 ± 
17%. There was a change in diagnostic plan in 145 subjects with 93 having a reduction in 
intensity of testing (p<0.001). GES was not associated with untoward outcomes within the first 30 
days follow-up; one major adverse cardiac event occurred within the 30 day period. GES testing in 
this study group allowed physicians to reclassify subjects for subsequent testing. Limitations of the 
study included sample population of nondiabetic subjects, and short-term follow-up of 30 days for 
monitoring of adverse events. 
 
Ladapo et al. (2014) published the results of the REGISTRY trial which was a prospective, 
multicenter observation registry of data collected regarding utilization of health care services for 
subjects who underwent GES testing at seven primary care sites. Following GES testing, medical 
assessments of the subjects were followed for 45 days to determine how clinicians managed the 
subjects (e.g., cardiology referrals, cardiac stress tests, angiography). Primary outcomes included 
the 45 day assessment outcomes, in addition to six-month follow up for evaluating major cardiac 
adverse events. The GES showed statistically significant relationships with patterns of cardiac 
referrals; subjects with a low GES had 94% decreased odds of referral versus subjects with an 
el  evated GES. The overall major adverse cardiac event rate was 5/339 during the follow-up 
period. Ladapo and colleagues concluded GES had an effect on patient management that was 
clinically relevant, and the test was safe as evidenced by a low major cardiac adverse cardiac 
event rate. The study was limited by lack of a control group. 
 
McPherson et al. (2013) evaluated the impact of gene expression testing on disease management 
by a group of cardiology specialists. The results of this study (n=88) demonstrated that subjects 
with low gene expression scores (i.e., ≤ 15) were more likely to have a decrease in the intensity 
of diagnostic testing. In addition, patients with elevated levels were more likely to undergo 
additional testing for the evaluation of obstructive CAD. Limitations of this study include small 
sample population, evaluation of short term outcomes (six months), and inclusion criteria of low 
risk individuals. 
 
Thomas et al. (2013) reported the results of a prospective, multicenter, double blind trial 
evaluating gene expression as a method to assess obstructive CAD (n=431) (COMPASS study). 
The study population consisted of a cohort of subjects referred for diagnostic myocardial perfusion 
imaging (MPI) stress testing with angina or angina equivalent symptoms. The subjects had blood 
samples for gene expression obtained prior to MPI and based on MPI results were referred for 
either invasive coronary angiography or CT angiography. The subjects were followed for six 
months with a study end point of a major adverse cardiac event. Angiography results were 
compared to GES and MPI results. GES was significantly correlated with maximum percent 
stenosis (≥ 50). Negative predictive value, sensitivity and specificity were reported at 96%, 89% 
and 52%, respectively. In the authors’ opinion gene expression scoring was more predictive of 
obstructive CAD compared to MPI and other clinical factors. Limitations noted by the authors 
included potentially lower disease prevalence in the subjects due to inclusion/exclusion criteria, 
and lack of comparison of GES scores to other noninvasive imaging modalities. 
 
Rosenberg and colleagues published results of the PREDICT trial (Personalized Risk Evaluation and 
Diagnosis in the Coronary Tree) in 2010, a trial designed to validate the diagnostic accuracy of 
gene expression, and reported sensitivity and specificity were 85% and 43% respectively. The 

Page 10 of    21 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
authors noted the algorithm score was moderately correlated with maximum percent stenosis 
(p<0.001). 
 
As a follow-up to the 2010 trial, Rosenberg and associates (2012) reported on the relation of gene 
expression testing to major adverse cardiovascular events and revascularization procedures. The 
study group involved an extended cohort of the PREDICT trial which included the validation cohort 
(n=526) as well as the algorithm development cohort (n=640). Subjects underwent angiography 
and gene expression testing and were followed for one year post angiography. The study endpoint 
was major adverse cardiac event or procedures. At one year the endpoint rate was 25% overall 
for all subjects. The gene expression score (GES) was associated with composite overall endpoint 
of both major events and procedures at one year (p<0.001) and at 12 months the sensitivity and 
specificity were 86% and 41% respectively. Elevated GES scores (>15) trended towards an 
increased rate of adverse events and procedures. The authors noted study limitations included 
limited follow-up period post index angiography, and exclusion of individuals with high risk 
unstable angina and low risk asymptomatic subjects. Further studies with larger cohorts and 
evaluation of longer term outcomes are needed. 
 
Multigene Germline Genetic Testing Panels  
 
Overall, the clinical utility of genetic testing is dependent upon the particular phenotype or 
observable characteristics of a disease and set of genes being tested. Similar to genetic testing for 
single genes, smaller, more targeted panels to assess for a particular disorder may have clinical 
utility when used to aid in diagnosis of heterogeneous genetic conditions. As with single gene 
testing, results of testing should directly impact clinical management and improve clinical 
outcomes for the individual being tested. Test results may preclude the need for additional tests, 
follow up or screening that would be recommended if panel testing is not performed. Additional 
advantages of panel testing include possible time and cost effectiveness as compared with the 
time and cost of analyzing each gene separately. The role of panel testing has not been 
established when treatment is largely supportive and/or results of testing will not result in a direct 
change in clinical management of the individual or lead to an improvement in clinical outcomes. 
 
Most multi-gene panels use next-generation sequencing (NGS) methodology, but some still use 
Sanger sequencing. Next generation sequencing technology allows large amounts of    DNA to be 
sequenced rapidly at a much lower price than prior sequencing methods. The evolution of this 
technology has spurred the development of tests that sequence multiple genes simultaneously. 
Such testing is expected to enable widespread evaluation of patients’ genomes in the clinical 
setting (Taber, et al., 2014). Multigene test panels range from small to large numbers of genes. 
For testing of multifactorial conditions, testing panels may include gene expression classifier and 
polygenic risk score tests. 
 
A polygenic risk score (PRS) is an assessment of a person’s risk of developing a specific condition 
based on the collective influence of many genetic variants. A PRS may only explain a person’s 
relative (not absolute) risk for a disease, as the data used for generating a PRS comes from large-
scale genomic studies. Approximately 79% of participants in genome-wide association studies are 
of European descent, despite comprising only 16% of the global population. Thus, there may not 
be adequate data about genomic variants from other populations to calculate a PRS in those 
populations. There is currently limited generalizability of genetic risk scores across diverse 
populations (NHGRI, 2020; Martin, et al., 2019). The American College of Medical Genetics and 
Genomics (ACMG) cautions the use of these tests, noting that genetic studies on complex traits 
and disease susceptibility is an "inexact science" (ACMG, 2021). For testing of multifactorial 
conditions, testing panels may include gene expression classifier and polygenic risk score tests.

Genetic Testing for Alzheimer’s Disease (including APOE) 
 
American Academy of Neurology (AAN): The Quality Standards Subcommittee of the AAN 
updated an earlier practice parameter for the diagnosis of dementia in the elderly. Regarding 
Alzheimer’s disease (AD), this evidence-based review concluded that there are no laboratory tests, 
including APOE genotyping or other genetic markers or biomarkers, which are appropriate for 
routine use in the clinical evaluation of patients with suspected AD. However, genotyping and 
biomarkers, as well as imaging, are promising avenues that are being pursued (Knopman, et al., 
2004). 
 
American Psychiatric Association (APA): The 2007 practice guidelines for the treatment of 
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and other dementias noted that a definitive diagnosis of AD 
requires both the clinical syndrome and microscopic examination of the brain at autopsy, at which 
time the characteristic plaques and neurofibrillary tangles widely distributed in the cerebral cortex 
will be seen. A careful clinical diagnosis of disease conforms to the pathological diagnosis 70%–
90% of the time. Further, the guideline noted that, although genes involved in a variety of 
dementia syndromes have been identified and family members of patients with dementia are often 
concerned about their risk of developing dementia, genetic testing is generally not part of the 
evaluation of patients with dementia except in very specific instances. In particular, testing for 
apolipoprotein E4 (APOE4) is not recommended for use in diagnosis. The presence of an APOE4 
allele does not change the need for a thorough workup and does not add substantially to 
diagnostic confidence. 
 
National Institute on Aging (NIA): In 2019, the NIA published a fact sheet noting that 
although a blood test can identify which APOE alleles a person has, it cannot predict who will or 
will not develop Alzheimer’s disease. Per the NIA, it is unlikely that genetic testing will ever be 
able to predict the disease with 100% accuracy because too many other factors may influence its 
development and progression. Further, the NIA noted APOE testing is used in research settings to 
identify study participants who may have an increased risk of developing Alzheimer’s. 
 
National Institute on Aging/Alzheimer’s Association: The NIA/AA issued consensus 
recommendations regarding the diagnosis of AD. For probable AD dementia in a carrier of a 
causative genetic mutation the recommendations note that in persons who meet the core clinical 
criteria for probable AD dementia, evidence of a causative genetic mutation (in APP, PSEN1, or 
PSEN2), increases the certainty that the condition is caused by AD pathology. Carriage of the 3/4 
allele of the apolipoprotein E gene is not sufficiently specific to be considered in this category 
(McKhann, et al., 2011). 
 
National Society of Genetic Counselors (NSGC)/American College of Medical Genetics 
and Genomics (ACMG): On behalf of the NSGC/ACMG, Goldman et al. (2018) published 
consensus practice guidelines for genetic counseling and testing for AD. The Guidelines 
recommend that pediatric testing for AD should not occur. Additionally, the Societies stated that 
direct-to-consumer APOE testing is not advised. 
 
The Guidelines noted that a risk assessment should be performed by pedigree analysis to 
determine whether the family history is consistent with early-onset Alzheimer’s disease (EOAD) or 
late-onset Alzheimer’s disease (LOAD) and with autosomal dominant (with or without complete 
penetrance), familial, or sporadic inheritance. Patients should be informed that currently there are 
no proven pharmacologic or lifestyle choices that reduce the risk of developing AD or stop its 
progression. The Guidelines also noted: 
 
For families in which an autosomal dominant AD gene mutation is a possibility: 

Page 12 of    21 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
 
• Testing for genes associated with early- onset autosomal dominant AD should be offered in 
the following situations: 
 
 a symptomatic individual with EOAD in the setting of a family history of dementia or 
in the setting of an unknown family history (e.g., adoption) 
 autosomal dominant family history of dementia with one or more cases of EOAD 
 a relative with a mutation consistent with EOAD (currently PSEN1/2 or APP) 
 Ideally, an affected family member should be tested first. If no affected family 
member is available for testing and an asymptomatic individual remains interested 
in testing despite counseling about the low likelihood of an informative result (a 
positive result for a pathogenic mutation), he/she should be counseled according to 
the recommended protocol. If the affected relative, or their next of kin, is 
uninterested in pursuing tested, the option of deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) banking 
should be discussed. 
 
For families in which autosomal dominant AD is unlikely: 
 
• Genetic testing for susceptibility loci (e.g., apolipoprotein-E [APOE]) is not clinically 
recommended due to limited clinical utility and poor predictive value. 
 
Genetic Testing for Cardiac Disease Risk 
 
American Academy of Family Physicians (AAFP): The AAFP recommends against genomics 
profiling to assess risk for cardiovascular disease, stating “the net health benefit from the use of 
any genomic tests for the assessment of cardiovascular disease risk is negligible and there is no 
evidence that they lead to improved patient management or increased risk reduction” (AAFP, 
2012). 
 
American Heart Association (AHA)/American College of Cardiology (ACC): Greenland et 
al. (2010) published guidelines which noted that genotype testing for CHD risk assessment in 
asymptomatic adults is not recommended. The task force noted that there is currently no proven 
benefit in risk assessment when genomic testing is added to the basic global risk assessment, 
such as Framingham. There is no data to support results of genotype testing alter management 
and improve clinical outcomes. The guidelines did not support genotype testing (level B evidence) 
or measurement of lipid parameters such as lipoproteins, apolipoproteins, particle size and 
density, beyond the standard fasting lipid profile (level C evidence), or natriuretic peptide testing 
(level B evidence). 
 
Updated ACC/AHA guidelines on the assessment of cardiovascular risk (Arnett, et al., 2019) did 
not address genetic testing to determine cardiovascular risk. 
 
Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and Prevention (EGAPP, 2010): The 
working group concluded there was insufficient evidence to determine analytic validity, clinical 
validity, or clinical utility for gene expression testing for determining cardiovascular risk. 
 
Genetic Testing for Methylenetetrahydrofolate Reductase (NAD(P)H) (MTHFR) 
Polymorphisms 
 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG): The reaffirmed ACMG practice 
guideline on the lack of evidence for MTHFR polymorphism testing noted (Bashford, et al., 2020): 
 

Page 13 of    21 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0052 
• MTHFR polymorphism genotyping should not be ordered as part of the clinical evaluation 
for thrombophilia or recurrent pregnancy loss 
• MTHFR polymorphism genotyping should not be ordered for at-risk family members 
 
American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG): ACOG (2018) does not 
endorse testing for MTHFR polymorphisms for routine risk assessment, evaluation of thrombosis 
risk, or recurrent pregnancy loss. 
 
Polygenic Risk Scores 
 
American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG, 2023): The ACMG notes the 
following regarding polygenic risk scores (PRS): 
 
• PRS test results do not provide a diagnosis, instead they provide a statistical prediction of 
increased clinical risk.  
• A low PRS does not rule out significant risk for the disease or condition in question.  
• If the risk prediction of a PRS is derived from a population that is different from the patient 
being tested, then the results may have a poor predictive value for the patient.  
• Isolated PRS testing is not the appropriate test for clinical scenarios in which monogenic 
etiology is known or suspected.  
• Before testing, a patient and provider should discuss the indications for the PRS test, and 
the patient should be informed how the PRS results will be used to guide medical 
management. 
• PRS-based medical management should be evidence-based; however, there is currently 
limited evidence to support the use of PRS to guide medical management.  
• Clinical follow-up for PRS should be consistent with best practices outlined by professional 
societies with appropriate expertise in instances when and where evidence-based practice 
guidelines exist.  
• The ACMG’s position is that preimplantation PRS testing is not yet appropriate for clinical 
use and should not be offered at this time.
