INSTRUCTIONS FOR USE 
 
The following Coverage Policy applies to health benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. 
Certain Cigna Companies and/or lines of business only provide utilization review services to clients 
and do not make coverage determinations. References to standard benefit plan language and 
coverage determinations do not apply to those clients. Coverage Policies are intended to provide 
guidance in interpreting certain standard benefit plans administered by Cigna Companies. Please 
note, the terms of a customer’s particular benefit plan document [Group Service Agreement, 
Evidence of Coverage, Certificate of Coverage, Summary Plan Description (SPD) or similar plan 
document] may differ significantly from the standard benefit plans upon which these Coverage 
Policies are based. For example, a customer’s benefit plan document may contain a specific 
exclusion related to a topic addressed in a Coverage Policy. In the event of a conflict, a customer’s 
benefit plan document always supersedes the information in the Coverage Policies. In the absence 
of a controlling federal or state coverage mandate, benefits are ultimately determined by the 
terms of the applicable benefit plan document. Coverage determinations in each specific instance 
require consideration of 1) the terms of the applicable benefit plan document in effect on the date 
of service; 2) any applicable laws/regulations; 3) any relevant collateral source materials including 
Coverage Policies and; 4) the specific facts of the particular situation. Each coverage request 
should be reviewed on its own merits. Medical directors are expected to exercise clinical judgment 
where appropriate and have discretion in making individual coverage determinations. Where 
coverage for care or services does not depend on specific circumstances, reimbursement will only 
be provided if a requested service(s) is submitted in accordance with the relevant criteria outlined 
in the applicable Coverage Policy, including covered diagnosis and/or procedure code(s). 

Page 2   of    36   
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
Reimbursement is not allowed for services when billed for conditions or diagnoses that are not 
covered under this Coverage Policy (see “Coding Information” below). When billing, providers 
must use the most appropriate codes as of the effective date of the submission. Claims submitted 
for services that are not accompanied by covered code(s) under the applicable Coverage Policy 
will be denied as not covered. Coverage Policies relate exclusively to the administration of health 
benefit plans. Coverage Policies are not recommendations for treatment and should never be used 
as treatment guidelines. In certain markets, delegated vendor guidelines may be used to support 
medical necessity and other coverage determinations. 
Overview 
 
This Coverage Policy addresses testing for acquired or somatic harmful or likely harmful changes 
in the genetic information of cells that occur after conception, for selected cancers and blood 
disorders. Test results may help determine disease staging,  chance of disease recurrence, and/or 
inform treatment planning. 
 
Coverage Policy 
 
Coverage for genetic testing varies across plans. Refer to the customer’s benefit plan 
document for coverage details.

General Background 
 
Somatic Mutation Genetic Testing 
Somatic mutations are changes in the DNA of a cell that may occur in any cell of the body except 
the germ cells (i.e., egg and sperm). Somatic mutations differ from germline mutations, which are 
passed down by blood relatives; somatic mutations are not inherited. The genetic tests described 
in this Coverage Policy are used to identify disease-causing somatic mutations or the biological 
activity of genes originating in a tumor or hematologic malignancy.  
 
Tumor markers, also known as biomarkers,  are substances that are produced by cancer cells or 
other cells or the body in response to cancer or certain benign (noncancerous) conditions. Tumor 
markers are proteins or other substances that are made at higher amounts by a cancer cell than a 
normal cell and may be useful in determining the extent or stage of disease or recurrence, 
determining the most effective treatment for a specific disease and how well the disease will 
respond to treatment. They can be found in the blood, urine, stool, tumor tissue, or other tissues 
or bodily fluids of some patients with cancer (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2023)  .   
 
Published peer-reviewed evidence and professional society/organizational consensus guidelines 
support testing for certain tumor markers for the screening, staging, diagnosis and management 
of some types of cancer. However, for other tumor markers there is insufficient evidence to 
establish clinical utility for informing on improvement of health outcomes. 
 
To have clinical utility the specific gene or gene biomarker for which testing has been requested, 
or gene expression classifier assay should be demonstrated in the published, peer-reviewed 
scientific literature in the form of prospective clinical trial data to improve the diagnosis, 
management, or clinical outcomes for the individual’s tumor type or disease when the individual is 
a candidate for a related therapy. The identification of the gene or biomarker should also be 
required to initiate a related therapy that has been validated by the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network
®
 ( NCCN
®
)  as a Category 1, 2A or 2B Level of Evidence and Consensus 

Page 17 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
recommendation as a standard of care. The NCCN categories of evidence and consensus are 
defined as:  
 
• Category 1: Based upon high-level evidence (≥1 randomized phase 3 trials or high-quality, 
robust meta-analyses), there is uniform NCCN consensus (≥85% support of the Panel) that 
the intervention is appropriate  
• Category 2A: Based upon lower-level evidence, there is uniform NCCN consensus (≥85% 
support of the Panel) that the intervention is appropriate  
• Category 2B: Based upon lower-level evidence, there is NCCN consensus (≥50%, but 
<85% support of the Panel) that the intervention is appropriate  
• Category 3: Based upon any level of evidence, there is major NCCN disagreement that the 
intervention is appropriate. 
 
Multigene panels may also provide important information regarding an individual’s tumor type to 
direct proven therapy or support management changes for hematology-oncology indications. 
These tests may be clinically useful when sequential testing of individual genes or biomarkers is 
not feasible because of limited tissue availability, or when urgent treatment decisions are pending 
and sequential testing would result in a prolonged testing schedule. 
 
There is insufficient evidence in the published, peer-reviewed scientific literature to support 
molecular testing when the requested gene(s) or biomarker(s) is(are) correlated with a known 
therapy, but that therapy has not been validated in prospective clinical trials for the specific tumor 
type or disease site. 
 
Broad Molecular Profile Testing 
Broad molecular profile tests, also known as molecular profiling and comprehensive genome 
profiling panels are large multigene tests which assess multiple genetic alterations simultaneously 
in a solid tumor. Several laboratory methods may be used to assess the tumor; however, next 
generation sequencing techniques are most commonly used. Broad molecular tests can identify 
alterations to base substitutions (substitution of an amino acid), insertions and deletions (amino 
acids are added or removed from DNA), copy number alterations (sections of DNA are repeated) 
and rearrangements (amino acids are rearranged in a different order). Broad molecular profile 
testing may be used with the goal of identifying mutations of interest for which drug therapy may 
be available or for enrollment in a clinical trial. Limitations to testing include testing for more 
alterations than have been identified for a specific type of cancer and the identification of 
variations of unknown significance. Nonetheless, such testing is supported by published 
professional society guidelines, including from the NCCN as a key component of care for a number 
of advanced, metastatic, refractory and recurrent cancers. 
 
Biopsy Testing Methods 
A biopsy is used as a diagnostic and monitoring tool to identify abnormalities in tissue or blood. A 
traditional tissue biopsy is used to sample and analyze a solid biological specimen. Tissue biopsy 
remains the gold standard for the confirmation and diagnosis of disease, including various 
cancers. Limitations include patient risk due the invasive nature of the test and limited availability 
of the tissue sample.  
 
There is increasing use of plasma cell-free DNA testing, also known as a liquid biopsy, which is 
used to sample and analyze nucleic acids in peripheral circulation, most commonly in plasma. At 
present there are no standards for analytical performance and no guidelines exist for regarding 
the recommended performance characteristics. Cell-free DNA testing has a high specificity rate 
but limitations include a compromised sensitivity with up to a 30% false-negative rate. Such 
testing may also identify alterations that are unrelated to a lesion of interest. Nonetheless, the use 
of cell-free DNA testing may be considered appropriate when a patient is medically unfit for 

Page 18 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
invasive tissue sampling or there is insufficient material for analysis in advanced (III or IV), 
metastatic, recurrent or refractory solid cancers.  
 
There is growing evidence which indicates sequential or concurrent tissue- and ctDNA-based 
testing can increase detection of actionable variants in certain individuals with advanced or 
metastatic cancer. Data has demonstrated these methodologies can be complementary to one 
another in individuals with advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast 
cancer, as unique actionable variants can be identified on both methodologies (Iams, et al., 2024; 
Xie, et al., 2023). 
 
Testing for Minimal Residual Disease 
Minimal residual disease refers to the presence of leukemic cells below the threshold of detection 
by conventional morphologic methods. Patients who achieve complete response by morphologic 
assessment alone can harbor leukemic cells in the bone marrow. Methods frequently utilized 
include a multiparameter (i.e., at least 6-color) flow cytometry to detect abnormal phenotypes, 
real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RQ-PCT) assays to detect fusion genes and 
high-throughput next generation sequencing (NGS)-based assays to detect clonal arrangements. 
An assay for minimal residual disease by high throughput sequencing methods is currently 
recommended as clinically useful for multiple myeloma, B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia, 
chronic lymphocytic leukemia, and peripheral and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. 
 
U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) 
FDA approval is not required for the development or marketing of specific gene tumor markers 
profiling tests, multigene panel tests or gene classifier tests. Many high-complexity tests are 
laboratory-developed in Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendment (CLIA)-certified 
laboratories   . 
 
Tumor Profile/Gene Expression Classifier Testing 
Gene expression classifier assays identify genetic alterations or biological activity of several genes 
in a tumor. Such tests may provide a more complete picture of a tumor’s molecular signature and 
enable a better estimate of the risk of distant recurrence when considered along with other 
molecular signatures and clinical characteristics. They have been proposed as an adjuvant tool to 
assist in determining overall survival, recurrence probability, appropriate treatment options and 
responsiveness to chemotherapy and are not advocated as stand-alone tools. Numerous gene 
profiling assays are currently marketed for use in the U.S.  
 
Professional Societies/Organizations  
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO): In 2022, ASCO published updated 
recommendations on the use of breast cancer biomarker assay results to guide adjuvant 
endocrine and chemotherapy decisions in early-stage breast cancer. The recommendations 
included the following (Andre, et al., 2022): 
• “Clinicians may use Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Breast Cancer Index (BCI), and 
EndoPredict to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in patients who are 
postmenopausal or age > 50 years with early-stage estrogen receptor (ER)–positive, 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)–negative (ER1 and HER2–) breast 
cancer that is node-negative or with 1-3 positive nodes.  
• Prosigna and BCI may be used in postmenopausal patients with node-negative ER1 and 
HER2– breast cancer.  
• In premenopausal patients, clinicians may use Oncotype in patients with node-negative 
ER1 and HER2– breast cancer.  
• Current data suggest that premenopausal patients with 1-3 positive nodes benefit from 
chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay result.  

Page 19 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
• There are no data on use of genomic tests to guide adjuvant chemotherapy in patients with 
≥ 4 positive nodes.  
• Ki67 combined with other parameters or immunohistochemistry 4 score may be used in 
postmenopausal patients without access to genomic tests to guide adjuvant therapy 
decisions.  
• BCI may be offered to patients with 0-3 positive nodes who received 5 years of endocrine 
therapy without evidence of recurrence to guide decisions about extended endocrine 
therapy.  
• None of the assays are recommended for treatment guidance in individuals with HER2-
positive or triple-negative breast cancer.  
• Treatment decisions should also consider disease stage, comorbidities, and patient 
preferences.” 
Supportive evidence and strength of recommendation varied by indication and test. 
 
Proteomic Testing 
Proteomics involves the quantitative and qualitative study of proteins, including the function, 
composition and structure and the way they interact inside cells. Protein expression may be 
changed by environmental conditions. Proteomics can identify and monitor biomarkers by 
analyzing the proteins in body fluids such as urine, serum, exhaled breath and spinal fluid. 
Proteomics can also facilitate drug development by providing a comprehensive map of protein 
interactions associated with disease pathways. A proteomic profile may be used to find and 
diagnose a disease or condition and to see how well the body responds to treatment (National 
Cancer Institute [NCI], 2023; Al-Amrani, et al., 2021).   
 
To be clinically useful the testing method must be scientifically and clinically validated and proven 
to have clinical utility based on prospective evidence, testing must be validated by the National 
Comprehensive Cancer Network
®
 (NCCN Guidelines
®
) as a category 1, 2A or 2B recommendation 
for the individual’s tumor type or disease and results of testing must directly impact clinical 
decision making. 
 
Circulating Whole Tumor Cell Testing 
Circulating whole tumor cells (CTCs) have been found in the peripheral blood circulation of 
individuals with various forms of metastatic cancer. CTCs are whole cells that have been shed by 
the tumor. The detection and testing of these tumor cells has been proposed as a method to 
stratify risk, monitor progression and monitor response to treatment.  
 
The use of circulating whole tumor cell testing has not been proven to impact meaningful health 
outcomes for most cancers. There is limited evidence to establish the clinical significance of 
circulating whole tumor cells and how identification can improve health outcomes. Pilot studies 
suggest that the identification of whole tumor cells may have a role in risk stratification and 
monitoring responses to treatment.  
 
However, the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines
®
) for prostate 
cancer (v2.2025) states that “androgen receptor splice variant 7 (AR-V7) testing in circulating 
tumor cells (CTCs) can be considered to help guide selection of therapy in the post-
abiraterone/enzalutamide metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer setting.”  
 
With the exception of testing for the AR-V7 variant in metastatic castrate-resistant prostate 
cancer, the role of this testing in patient management is not yet known (Antonarakis, et al., 2015; 
Antonarakis, et al., 2014). Larger longitudinal studies with standard techniques in clearly-defined 
populations of patients are needed to establish the role of such testing.  
 

Page 20 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
Literature Review—Breast Cancer: Smerage et al. (2014) reported on a randomized trial of 
patients with persistent increase in CTCs that were tested to determine whether changing 
chemotherapy after one cycle of first-line chemotherapy would improve the primary outcome of 
overall survival (OS). Five hundred ninety-five female patients were included with histologically 
confirmed breast cancer and clinical and/or radiographic evidence of metastatic disease. Patients 
who underwent chemotherapy had evaluation for CTCs at baseline and then after one cycle. 
Women whose CTCs remained elevated after the first cycle of therapy (arm C) (n=123) were 
randomly assigned to either maintain the initial treatment plan (n=64) or to change of 
chemotherapy (n=59). Changing to an alternate regimen had no difference in OS compared with 
continuation of the initial regimen (median 12.5 versus 10.7 months, respectively, p=0.98). The 
CTCs did appear to have prognostic value: the median OS for arms A, B, and C were 35 months, 
23 months, and 13 months, respectively. While it appears that there is prognostic value of CTCs, 
the role in clinical management in breast cancer has not been demonstrated. 
 
Zhang et al. (2012) reported on a meta-analysis of published literature on the prognostic 
relevance of CTC, including patients with early and advanced disease. Forty-nine eligible studies 
with 6,825 patients were identified. The main outcomes analyzed were overall survival (OS) and 
disease-free survival (DFS) in early-stage breast cancer patients, as well as progression-free 
survival (PFS) and OS in metastatic breast cancer patients. Pooled hazard ratio (HR) and 95% 
confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using the random and the fixed-effects models. The 
presence of CTC was significantly associated with shorter survival in the total population. The 
prognostic value of CTC was significant in both early (DFS: HR, 2.86; 95% CI, 2.19–3.75; OS: HR, 
2.78; 95% CI, 2.22–3.48) and metastatic breast cancer (PFS: HR, 1.78; 95% CI, 1.52–2.09; OS: 
HR, 2.33; 95% CI, 2.09–2.60). Subgroup analyses showed that our results were stable 
irrespective of the CTC detection method and time point of blood withdrawal. The authors 
conclude that the detection of CTC is a stable prognosticator in patients with early-stage and 
metastatic breast cancer; however further studies are required to explore the clinical utility of CTC 
in breast cancer. 
 
Bidard et al. (2012) conducted a prospective observational study that compared serum marker 
levels with CTC in 267 metastatic breast cancer patients. The secondary pre-planned endpoint 
derived from a study that previously reported on CTC as prognostic factor (Pierga, et al., 2011), 
compared prospectively the positivity rates and the value of CTC (CellSearch), of serum tumor 
markers (carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen 15.3 (CA 15-3), CYFRA 21-1), and of 
serum non-tumor markers (lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), alkaline phosphatase (ALP)) at baseline 
and under treatment for PFS prediction, independently from the other known prognostic factors, 
using univariate analyses and concordance indexes. The study reported that a total of 90% of the 
patients had at least one elevated blood marker. The blood markers were correlated with poor 
performance status, high number of metastatic sites and with each other. CYFRA 21-1, a marker 
usually used in lung cancer, was elevated in 65% of patients. A total of 86% of patients had either 
CA 15-3 and/or CYFRA 21-1 elevated at baseline. Each serum marker was associated, when 
elevated at baseline, with a significantly shorter PFS. Serum marker changes during treatment, 
assessed either between baseline and the third week or between baseline and weeks six-ni  ne, 
 
were significantly associated with PFS, as reported for CTC. Concordance indices comparison 
showed no clear superiority of any of the serum marker or CTC for PFS prediction. The authors 
concluded that for the purpose of PFS prediction by measuring blood marker changes during 
treatment, currently available blood-derived markers (CTC and serum markers) had globally 
similar performances. There was no clear superiority found of CTC over the other serum markers. 
 
Liu et al. (2009) conducted on a prospective study that examined the correlation of CTCs with 
radiographic findings for disease progression. Serial CTC levels were obtained in patients (n=68) 
that were starting a new treatment regimen for progressive, radiographically measurable 
metastatic breast cancer. Blood was collected at baseline and three to four week intervals and 

Page 21 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
radiographic studies were performed in nine to twelve week intervals. Median follow-up was 13.3 
months. Patients who had five or more CTCs had 6.3 times the odds of radiographic disease 
progression when compared with patients who had less than five CTCs. Shorter progression-free 
survival was observed for patients with five or more CTCs at three to five weeks and at seven to 
nine weeks after the start of treatment. The CTC result was statistically significantly associated 
with disease progression for all patients (p<0.001). The association was noted to remain strong in 
patients treated with either chemotherapy or endocrine therapy. Potential limitations of the study 
include that the study included patients receiving various lines and types of therapy. The subgroup 
analysis for CTC-imaging correlation was performed by including biologic agents with either 
chemotherapy or endocrine therapy—it was noted that each group was too small to be analyzed 
alone. 
 
Nolé et al. (2008) conducted a prospective study to evaluate the prognostic significance of CTCs 
detection in advanced breast cancer patients. The study included 80 patients with inclusion 
criteria: women with histological diagnosis of breast cancer, evidence of metastatic disease from 
imaging studies, starting a new line of therapy and/or treated for the advanced disease with a 
maximum two lines of therapy. The CellSearch system was used to test for circulating tumor cell 
levels before starting a new treatment and after four, eight weeks, the first clinical evaluation and 
every two months thereafter. At baseline, 49 patients were found to have ≥ 5 CTCs. The baseline 
number of CTCs were associated with progression-free survival (hazard ratio [HR] 2.5; 95% 
confidence interval [CI] 1.2–5.4). The risk of progression for patients with CTCs ≥ 5 at the last 
available blood draw was five times the risk of patients with 0–4 CTCs at the same time point (HR 
5.3; 95% CI 2.8–10.4). At the last available blood draw, patients with rising or persistent CTCs ≥ 
5 demonstrated a statistically significant higher risk of progression with respect to patients with 
CTCs < 5 at both blood draws (HR 6.4; 95% CI 2.8–14.6). The authors noted that these results 
indicated that elevated CTCs levels measured at any time in the clinical course of a patient with 
metastatic breast cancer predict an imminent progression and that this analysis represents an 
additional step in the process of validating this method. 
 
Literature Review—Colorectal Cancer: Groot Koerkamp et al. (2013) reported on systematic 
review of studies that investigated the prognostic value of tumor cells in blood (CTCs) or bone 
marrow (BM) (disseminated tumor cells [DTC]) of patients with resectable colorectal liver 
metastases or widespread metastatic colorectal cancer (CRC). A total of 16 studies with 1,491 
patients were included in the review and the results of 12 studies (1,329 patients) included in the 
meta-analysis. Eight studies used RT-PCR methodology to detect tumor cells, nine studies applied 
immunocytochemistry (five with CellSearch) and one study applied both methods. The overall 
survival (hazard ratio [HR], 2.47; 95 % CI 1.74–3.51) and progression-free survival (PFS) (HR, 
2.07; 95 % CI 1.44–2.98) were worse in patients with CTCs. The subgroup of studies with more 
than 35% CTC-positive patients was the only subgroup with a statistically significant worse PFS. 
The eight studies that had multivariable analysis identified the detection of CTCs as an 
independent prognostic factor for survival. Limitations of the study included a considerable degree 
of interstudy heterogeneity. The study does not demonstrate the clinical utility of CTC detection, 
or that the detection of CTCs is a predictive factor, or identify patients that may benefit from a 
specific treatment. 
 
Sastre et al. (2012) reported on an ancillary study of 180 patients that was a subset of a phase III 
study (The Maintenance in Colorectal Cancer trial) that assessed maintenance therapy with single-
agent bevacizumab versus bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in patients with metastatic colorectal 
cancer. The ancillary study was conducted to evaluate CTC count as a prognostic and/or predictive 
marker for efficacy endpoints. Blood samples were obtained at baseline and after three cycles. 
CTC enumeration was performed with CellSearch System. The study found that the median 
progression-free survival (PFS) interval for patients with a CTC count ≥3 at baseline was 7.8 
months, as compared to 12.0 months found in patients with a CTC count <3 (p=0.0002). The 

Page 22 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
median overall survival (OS) time was 17.7 months for patients with a CTC count >3, compared 
with 25.1 months for patients with a lower count (p=0.0059). After three cycles, the median PFS 
interval for patients with a low CTC count was 10.8 months, which was noted to be longer than 
the 7.5 months for patients with a high CTC count (p=0.005). The median OS time for patients 
with a CTC count <3 was significantly longer than for patients with a CTC count ≥3, 25.1 months 
compared to 16.2 months, respectively (p=0.0095). 
 
Thorsteinsson and Jess (2011) conducted a review of studies of CTCs in colorectal cancer (CRC). 
Nine studies were included in the review. Detection rates of CTC in peripheral blood of patients 
with non-metastatic CRC varied from 4% to 57%. Inclusion criteria included: patients diagnosed 
with non-metastatic colorectal cancer; CTC detected in peripheral blood samples; pre- and/or 
post-operative blood samples; and samples size of more than 99 patients. Seven studies applied 
RT-PCR and two studies used immunocytochemical methods. Seven studies found the presence of 
CTC to be a prognostic marker of poor disease-free survival. The authors concluded that the 
presence of CTC in peripheral blood is a potential marker of poor disease-free survival in patients 
with non-metastatic CRC and that the low abundance of CTC in non-metastatic CRC needs very 
sensitive and specific detection methods. They also noted that an international consensus on 
choice of detection method and markers is warranted before incorporating CTC into risk 
stratification in the clinical setting.  
 
Rahbari et al. (2010) reported on a meta-analysis of studies to assess whether the detection of 
tumor cells in blood and bone marrow of patients diagnosed with colorectal cancer (CRC) can be 
used as a prognostic factor. Thirty-six studies were included in the review that examined the 
detection of free blood or bone marrow tumor cells with patient’s prognosis and included various 
methods of techniques (e.g., reverse transcriptase-PCR [RT-PCR]) and immunologic). The review 
indicated that the presence of CTCs detected in peripheral blood is of strong prognostic 
significance in patients with CRC. There was considerable interstudy heterogeneity noted in 
regards to differences in the detection methods, types and numbers of target genes or antigens, 
sampling site and time, and in demographic or clinicopathologic status of patients. 
 
Literature Review—Prostate Cancer: Resel Folkersma et al. (2012) reported on a prospective 
study that analyzed the correlation between circulating tumor cell (CTC) levels and 
clinicopathologic parameters (prostate-specific antigen [PSA] level, Gleason score, and TNM stage) 
in patients with metastatic hormone-sensitive prostate cancer (PCa) and to establish its prognostic 
value in overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The study included three arms: 
30 patients with localized PCa; 30 patients with metastatic PCa; and 30 healthy volunteers. The 
median follow-up was 42.9 months. A significant positive correlation was demonstrated between 
the CTC level and all tumor burden markers (PSA and T, N, and M stage; p<0.001), except for 
Gleason score (tau=0.16). A cutoff of ≥4 CTCs/7.5 mL was chosen to distinguish patients with a 
poor prognosis. These patients had a significantly shorter median OS and PFS (24 compared to 45 
months and 7 compared to 44 months, respectively;    p<0.001). As the CTC level increased, the OS 
and PFS were noted to decrease. The risk of mortality and progression for the patients with ≥4 
CTCs was 4.1 (p=0.029) and 8.5 (p<0.001) times greater. Multivariate analyses indicated that a 
CTC of ≥4 was an independent prognostic factor for PFS (hazard ratio 5.9, p<0.005).  
 
Several observational studies have been published that correlate CTC with disease status and 
progression in prostate cancer (Goodman, et al. 2009; Okegawa, et al., 2009; Olmos, et al., 
2009; Scher, et al., 2009; Okegawa, et al., 2008; Danila, et al., 2007; Shaffer, et al., 2007; 
Moreno, et al., 2005).

American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO): In the 2022 guidelines on the use of breast 
cancer biomarker assay results to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy decisions in early-
stage breast cancer, ASCO made the following recommendations (Andre, et al., 2022): 
• If a patient has node-negative or node-positive ER-positive, HER2-positive, or TNBC, the 
clinician should not use circulating tumor cells (CTC) to guide decisions for adjuvant 
endocrine and chemotherapy (Type: Evidence-Based; Evidence Quality: Intermediate; 
Strength of Recommendation: Strong). 
• If a patient has node-negative or node-positive ER-positive, HER2-positive, or TNBC, the 
clinician should not use ctDNA to guide decisions for adjuvant endocrine
 and chemotherapy 
(Type: Evidence-Based; Evidence Quality: Intermediate; Strength of Recommendation: 
Strong).” 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists 
(CAP): In collaboration with CAP, ASCO published a joint review regarding circulating tumor DNA 
analysis in individuals with cancer (Merker, et al., 2018). The review noted some circulating DNA 
(ctDNA) assays have demonstrated clinical validity and utility with certain types of advanced 
cancer; however, there is insufficient evidence of clinical validity and utility for the majority of 
ctDNA assays in advanced cancer. Evidence shows discordance between the results of ctDNA 
assays and genotyping tumor specimens and supports tumor tissue genotyping to confirm 
undetected results from ctDNA tests. There is no evidence of clinical utility and little evidence of 
clinical validity of ctDNA assays in early-stage cancer, treatment monitoring, or residual disease 
detection. There is no evidence of clinical validity and clinical utility to suggest that ctDNA assays 
are useful for cancer screening, outside of a clinical trial. 
 
Screening and Prognostic Tests for Early Detection of Prostate Cancer 
Prostate specific antigen (PSA), an organ-specific marker, is often used as a tumor marker. The 
higher the level of PSA at baseline, the higher is the risk for metastatic disease or subsequent 
disease progression. However, it is an imprecise marker of risk. Various approaches aimed at 
improving the performance of PSA in early cancer detection have been tested, including the 
measurement of prostate biomarkers; none have yet been proven to decrease the risk of death 
from prostate cancer (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2025c  ).  
 
According to the NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines in Oncology (NCCN Guidelines
®
) for prostate 
cancer early detection (v2.2025), biomarkers which improve the specificity of prostate cancer 
detection are not yet mandated as first-line screening tests in conjunction with serum PSA. 
However, there may be some individuals who meet PSA standards for prostate biopsy 
consideration, but who would like to more precisely the estimate risk of cancer before proceeding 
to biopsy. The extent of validation of these biomarker tests varies across diverse populations, and 
it is not yet known with certainty how these biomarker tests may be used in optimal combination 
with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). The NCCN guideline provides the following pre- and post-
biopsy biomarker testing recommendations: 
 
• Pre- initial biopsy  
 The probability of high-grade cancer (Grade Group ≥ 2) may be further defined 
prior to initial biopsy utilizing tests such as: 
o Prostate Health Index (PHI)  
o SelectMDx  
o 4Kscore 
o ExoDx Prostate Test  
o MyProstateScore (MPS)  
o MPS 2.0 (MPS2) (category 2B recommendation) 
o Stockholm3  
o IsoPSA 

Page 24 of    36

• Post- initial biopsy  
 Tests that improve specificity in the post-biopsy setting may be considered in 
patients thought to be higher risk despite a negative prostate biopsy.  
 Tests to be considered are: 
o percent-free PSA 
o 4Kscore  
o PHI 
o PCA3 
o ConfirmMDx 
o ExoDx Prostate Test 
o MPS 
o MPS2 (category 2B recommendation)  
o IsoPSA 
 
Professional Societies/Organizations 
American Urological Association (AUA): The 2023 AUA guideline for the early detection of 
prostate cancer included the following recommendations concerning biomarkers (Wei, et al., 
2023a, 2023b): 
 
• When screening for prostate cancer, clinicians should use prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 
as the first screening test. (Strong Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade A)  
 Regarding the use of the Stockholm3 test as a first-line screening test for predicting 
the risk of GG2+ prostate cancers, the AUA noted that while the test appears 
promising, further validation in diverse populations to confirm initial findings is 
needed to move forward into practice. 
• For individuals with a newly elevated PSA, clinicians should repeat the PSA prior to a 
secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy. (Expert Opinion) 
• For individuals undergoing prostate cancer screening, clinicians should not use PSA velocity 
as the sole indication for a secondary biomarker, imaging, or biopsy. (Strong 
Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B) 
• Clinicians may use adjunctive urine or serum markers when further risk stratification would 
influence the decision regarding whether to proceed with biopsy. (Conditional 
Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) 
 The AUA further noted that “such biomarkers should not be used in situations in 
which, based on available clinical and laboratory data, the risk of GG2+ prostate 
cancer is so low or so high the result of adjunctive biomarkers would not influence 
the decision of whether to proceed with further testing (e.g., MRI and/or biopsy)”. 
• After a negative initial biopsy in patients with low probability for harboring GG2+ prostate 
cancer, clinicians should not reflexively perform biomarker testing. (Clinical Principle) 
• After a negative biopsy, clinicians may use blood, urine, or tissue-based biomarkers 
selectively for further risk stratification if results are likely to influence the decision 
regarding repeat biopsy or otherwise substantively change the patient’s management. 
(Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C) 
 
Tumor Tissue-Based Molecular and Proteomic Assays for Detection of Prostate Cancer 
The NCCN Guidelines
®
 for prostate cancer (v2.2025) notes that although risk groups, life 
expectancy estimates, and nomograms help inform treatment decisions, there remains uncertainty 
regarding the risk of disease progression. Several tumor tissue-based molecular assays have been 
developed to improve decision-making in individuals newly diagnosed with prostate cancer, and 
those undergoing treatment. The NCCN guideline provides the following recommendations for such 
testing: 
 

Page 25 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
• Individuals with low or favorable intermediate disease and life expectancy ≥ 10 years may 
consider the use of the Decipher
®
, Oncotype DX
®
 Prostate (Genomic Prostate Score), or 
Prolaris
®
 genomic tests during initial risk stratification. 
• Individuals with unfavorable intermediate- and high-risk disease and life expectancy ≥10 
years may consider the use of Decipher
®
 or   Prolaris
®
.   
• Decipher
®
 may be considered to inform adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found 
after radical prostatectomy and during workup for radical prostatectomy PSA persistence or 
recurrence. 
 
Although these tests have not been validated by prospective, randomized clinical trial data, 
retrospective case cohort studies demonstrate that these tests provide prognostic information 
independent of NCCN or Cancer of the Prostate Risk Assessment (CAPRA) risk groups which 
include likelihood of death with conservative management, likelihood of recurrence after radical 
prostatectomy or external beam radiation therapy (EBRT), likelihood of adverse pathologic 
features after radical prostatectomy, and likelihood of developing metastasis after surgery or EBRT 
(NCCN, 2025).  
 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms  
Polycythemia Vera (PV), Essential Thrombocythemia (ET) and Primary Myelofibrosis 
(PMF): Identification of the JAK2, MPL and CALR exon 9 common variants in individuals with 
polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primary myelofibrosis (PMF) may aid 
in diagnosis based on diagnostic criteria for each of these diseases. For some individuals with PV, 
JAK2 exon 12 mutation testing may also be of benefit in disease management. Likewise, genetic 
testing for MPL common variants and targeted mutation analysis of CALR exon 9 may be 
appropriate to aid in the diagnosis and management of ET and PMF. According to 2016 World 
Health Organization (WHO) criteria (Arber, et al., 2016), ASXL1, EZH2, TET2, IDH1/IDH2, SRSF2 
and SF3B1 mutation analysis may aid in diagnosis of PMF.  
 
Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia and Philadelphia Chromosome Positive (PH+) Acute 
Lymphoblastic Leukemia Mutation Testing: Specific mutations in the Breakpoint Cluster 
Region-Abelson (BCR-ABL) gene have been shown to confer resistance to imatinib both in vitro 
and in vivo, by affecting the binding of the drug to the tyrosine kinase enzyme (Agency for 
Healthcare Research and Quality [AHRQ], 2010). Of interest is the T315-I mutation, which is 
thought to be resistant to all current tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy. The mutation 
frequency in imatinib resistant patients with CML ranges between 2% and 20%, with variability 
related to detection methods as well as patient cohort characteristics and treatment. T315I 
mutation frequency appears to be greater in patients with Philadelphia chromosome-positive (Ph
+
) 
ALL and likely increases with the continuation of TKI treatment (Nicolini, et al., 2009). The 
detection of mutations of the BCR-ABL gene has been proposed with potential impact on diagnosis 
and management decisions (National Cancer Institute [NCI], 2025a, 2025b; AHRQ, 2010). 
Evidence in the published, peer-reviewed scientific literature also supports the usefulness of 
testing for BCR-ABL resistance or inhibition.  
 
Real-time quantitative PCR (RQ-PCR) is by far the most sensitive method. It provides an accurate 
measure of the total leukemia cell mass and the degree to which breakpoint cluster region-
Abelson (BCR-ABL) transcripts are reduced by therapy, and correlates with progression-free 
survival. Current international recommendations for optimal molecular monitoring of patients 
receiving imatinib treatment include an RQ-PCR assay expressing the BCR-ABL transcript levels, 
which is predictive of prognosis (Bhatia, et al.,   2012). In acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), 
because many patients have a different fusion protein from the one found in chronic myelogenous 
leukemia (CML), the BCR-ABL gene may be detectable only by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis or 
reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). These tests should be performed 
whenever possible in patients with ALL, especially those with B-cell lineage disease (NCI, 2025a). 

Page 26 of    36

Although certain BCR-ABL mutations may be associated with TKI therapy resistance, sensitivity 
and specificity values in outcome studies are not suggestive of strong predictive ability, with the 
exception of the T315-I mutation. Early identification of this mutation may allow for alternative 
treatment regimens including increased dose scheduling and drug selection. Data in the published 
peer-reviewed scientific literature supports the clinical utility of testing for the presence of the 
T315-I mutation. The clinical utility of testing for other mutations to determine TKI resistance has 
not been established. 
 
Literature Review: Several studies have reported associations between variations of BCR-ABL 
and response to drug therapy. AHRQ (2010) performed a systematic review of the published 
literature regarding variations of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene and response to imatinib, dasatinib, 
and nilotinib in CML. Thirty-one studies were analyzed for outcomes of interest including overall 
survival and cancer specific survival; progression-free or event-free survival (as defined by each 
study); and treatment failure. Typically, treatment failure is defined as absence of hematologic, 
cytogenetic, or molecular response to treatment, according to various criteria. Data was analyzed 
for first-, second-, and third- line TKI therapy. Second-line TKI therapy studies (four publications) 
demonstrated sensitivity and specificity ranges of 0.35 to 0.83 and from 0.58 to 1.00, 
respectively, for high-dose imatinib and imatinib-based combination. These studies were small, 
the calculated sensitivity and specificity values have wide confidence intervals, and a range of 
different mutations was identified in each of them. No robust conclusions could be made. Eight 
studies (nine publications) pertained to dasatinib; some had overlapping populations. Sensitivities 
and specificities ranged from 0.27 to 0.90 and from 0.14 to 0.87, respectively. A lack of predictive 
ability is suggested. For nilotinib, three studies had relevant data. Sensitivity ranged from 0.56 to 
0.71 and specificity ranged from 0.42 to 0.56 for all identified mutations. Only one included study 
reviewed overall survival (OS). No statistically significant differences in the time-to-death among 
patients with, versus without mutations were found. When any breakpoint cluster region-Abelson 
(BCR-ABL1) mutation was considered, almost all studies reported sensitivity and specificity values 
that are not suggestive of strong predictive ability.  
 
The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) noted that no study explicitly reported 
details on changes in treatment plans before or after testing. AHRQ determined that the presence 
of any BCR-ABL mutation does not appear to differentiate response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
(TKI) treatment (i.e., imatinib, dasatinib, nilotinib). AHRQ also noted that the majority of evidence 
pertains to the short term surrogate outcomes of hematologic, cytogenetic or molecular response. 
Data on overall or progression-free survival are sparse. There is consistent evidence that presence 
of the relatively rare T315-I mutation can predict TKI treatment failure, mainly in terms of 
hematologic and cytogenetic response (AHRQ, 2010).  
 
Jabbour et al. (2009) studied 169 patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) after 
imatinib failure. The goals of the study were to investigate whether in vitro sensitivity of kinase 
domain mutations could be used to predict the response to therapy as well as the long-term 
outcome of patients receiving second-generation TKIs after imatinib failure. Treatment failure was 
defined as loss of a cytogenetic, or complete hematologic response (CHP), or failure to achieve a 
CHR or any hematologic response (for patients in accelerated phase or blast phase after three 
months of therapy, or persistence of 100% Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)–positive metaphases 
after 6 months of therapy, or more than or equal to 35% after 12 months). Fifty-seven patients 
(66%) had received prior therapy with interferon-alpha before the start of imatinib; 29 (34%) had 
received imatinib as their first-line therapy for CML. Mutations were detected by cDNA sequencing 
for mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL before a change to dasatinib or nilotinib in 86 
patients. Ninety-four mutations were identified in 86 patients with imatinib failure. Seven patients 
harbored more than one mutation. There was no difference in patient characteristics between 
those with mutations at the time of imatinib failure versus those with no mutations. Forty-one 

Page 27 of    36 
Medical Coverage Policy: 0520 
patients received dasatinib and 45 received nilotinib after developing failure to imatinib therapy. 
Hematologic and cytogenetic response rates were similar for patients without or with KD 
mutations. After a median follow-up of 23 months, 48 (58%) of patients without baseline 
mutations were alive compared with 52 (60%) with any mutation. 
 
Nicolini et al. (2009) reported the results of a retrospective observational study of 222 patients 
with CML in chronic-phase, accelerated-phase, or blastic-phase and Philadelphia chromosome-
positive (Ph
+
) ALL patients with the BCR-ABL T315I mutation. After T315I mutation detection, 
second-generation TKIs were used in 56% of cases, hydroxyurea in 39%, imatinib in 35%, 
cytarabine in 26%, MK-0457 in 11%, stem cell transplantation in 17%, and interferon-alpha in 6% 
of cases. Median overall survival from T315I mutation detection was 22.4, 28.4, 4.0, and 4.9 
months, and median progression-free survival was 11.5, 22.2, 1.8, and 2.5 months, respectively, 
for chronic phase, accelerated phase, blastic phase, and Ph(+) ALL patients. These results suggest 
that survival of patients harboring a T315I mutation is dependent on disease phase at the time of 
mutation detection. 
 
In an earlier study by Jabbour et al. (2006) 171 patients were screened for mutations after failing 
TKI therapy with a median follow-up of 38 months from start of therapy. Sixty-six mutations 
impacting 23 amino acids in the BCR-ABL oncogene were identified in 62 (36%) patients. Factors 
associated with the development of mutations were older age, previous interferon therapy and 
accelerated or blast phase at the start of TKI therapy. By multivariate analysis, factors associated 
with worse survival were development of clonal evolution and a higher percentage of peripheral 
blood basophils. The presence of a BCR-ABL kinase domain mutation had no impact on survival. 
When survival was measured from the time therapy started, non-P-loop mutations were 
associated with a shorter survival than P-loop mutations. The authors concluded that BCR-ABL P-
loop mutations were not associated with a worse outcome. This study suggests that outcomes of 
individuals who fail TKI therapy may be influenced by multiple factors. 
 
Nicolini and colleagues (2006) retrospectively analyzed the predictive impact of 94 breakpoint 
cluster region (BCR) -  Abelson (ABL) kinase domain mutations found in 89 protein tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor (TKI) resistant chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) individuals. With a median follow-up 
of 39 months, overall survival was worse for P-loop and another point mutation (T315-I), but not 
for other BCR-ABL mutations. For individuals in chronic phase only, analysis demonstrated a worse 
overall survival for P-loop and worse progression free survival for T315-I mutations. 
 
Professional Societies/Organizations 
National Cancer Institute (NCI): Regarding BCR-ABL mutation analysis in individuals with 
chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), the NCI states “ In case of treatment failure or suboptimal 
response, patients should undergo BCR::ABL1 kinase domain mutation analysis to help guide 
therapy with the newer TKIs or with allogeneic transplant” (  NCI, 2025b). 
 
Health Equity Considerations 
 
Health equity is the highest level of health for all people; health inequity is the avoidable 
difference in health status or distribution of health resources due to the social conditions in which 
people are born, grow, live, work, and age.  
 
Social determinants of health are the conditions in the environment that affect a wide range of 
health, functioning, and quality of life outcomes and risks. Examples include safe housing, 
transportation, and neighborhoods; racism, discrimination and violence; education, job 
opportunities and income; access to nutritious foods and physical activity opportunities; access to 
clean air and water; and language and literacy skills.
