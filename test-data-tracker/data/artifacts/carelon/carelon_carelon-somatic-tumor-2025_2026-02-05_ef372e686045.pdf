Description and Application of the Guidelines 
The Carelon Clinical Appropriateness Guidelines (hereinafter “the Carelon Clinical Appropriateness Guidelines” or 
the “Guidelines”) are designed to assist providers in making the most appropriate treatment decision for a specific 
clinical condition for an individual. The Guidelines establish objective and evidence-based criteria for medical 
necessity determinations, where possible, that can be used in support of the following:  
• To establish criteria for when services are medically necessary  
• To assist the practitioner as an educational tool 
• To encourage standardization of medical practice patterns 
• To curtail the performance of inappropriate and/or duplicate services 
• To address patient safety concerns 
• To enhance the quality of health care 
• To promote the most efficient and cost-effective use of services 
The Carelon guideline development process complies with applicable accreditation and legal standards, including 
the requirement that the Guidelines be developed with involvement from appropriate providers with current clinical 
expertise relevant to the Guidelines under review and be based on the most up-to-date clinical principles and best 
practices. Resources reviewed include widely used treatment guidelines, randomized controlled trials or 
prospective cohort studies, and large systematic reviews or meta-analyses. Carelon reviews all of its Guidelines 
at least annually. 
Carelon makes its Guidelines publicly available on its website. Copies of the Guidelines are also available upon 
oral or written request. Additional details, such as summaries of evidence, a list of the sources of evidence, and 
an explanation of the rationale that supports the adoption of the Guidelines, are included in each guideline 
document. 
Although the Guidelines are publicly available, Carelon considers the Guidelines to be important, proprietary 
information of Carelon, which cannot be sold, assigned, leased, licensed, reproduced or distributed without the 
written consent of Carelon. 
Carelon applies objective and evidence-based criteria, and takes individual circumstances and the local delivery 
system into account when determining the medical appropriateness of health care services. The Carelon 
Guidelines are just guidelines for the provision of specialty health services. These criteria are designed to guide 
both providers and reviewers to the most appropriate services based on a patient’s unique circumstances. In all 
cases, clinical judgment consistent with the standards of good medical practice should be used when applying the 
Guidelines. Guideline determinations are made based on the information provided at the time of the request. It is 
expected that medical necessity decisions may change as new information is provided or based on unique 
aspects of the patient’s condition. The treating clinician has final authority and responsibility for treatment 
decisions regarding the care of the patient and for justifying and demonstrating the existence of medical necessity 
for the requested service. The Guidelines are not a substitute for the experience and judgment of a physician or 
other health care professionals. Any clinician seeking to apply or consult the Guidelines is expected to use 
independent medical judgment in the context of individual clinical circumstances to determine any patient’s care 
or treatment. 
The Guidelines do not address coverage, benefit or other plan specific issues. Applicable federal and state 
coverage mandates take precedence over these clinical guidelines, and in the case of reviews for Medicare 
Advantage Plans, the Guidelines are only applied where there are not fully established CMS criteria. If requested 
by a health plan, Carelon will review requests based on health plan medical policy/guidelines in lieu of the 
Carelon Guidelines. Use of an FDA-approved or conditionally approved product does not constitute medical 
necessity or guarantee reimbursement by the respective health plan. 
The Guidelines may also be used by the health plan or by Carelon for purposes of provider education, or to 
review the medical necessity of services by any provider who has been notified of the need for medical necessity 
review, due to billing practices or claims that are not consistent with other providers in terms of frequency or some 
other manner.

General Clinical Guideline 
Clinical Appropriateness Framework 
Critical to any finding of clinical appropriateness under the guidelines for a specific diagnostic or therapeutic 
intervention are the following elements: 
• Prior to any intervention, it is essential that the clinician confirm the diagnosis or establish its pretest 
likelihood based on a complete evaluation of the patient. This includes a history and physical 
examination and, where applicable, a review of relevant laboratory studies, diagnostic testing, and 
response to prior therapeutic intervention. 
• The anticipated benefit of the recommended intervention is likely to outweigh any potential harms, 
including from delay or decreased access to services that may result (net benefit). 
• Widely used treatment guidelines and/or current clinical literature and/or standards of medical practice 
should support that the recommended intervention offers the greatest net benefit among competing 
alternatives.  
• There exists a reasonable likelihood that the intervention will change management and/or lead to an 
improved outcome for the patient. 
Providers may be required to submit clinical documentation in support of a request for services. Such 
documentation must a) accurately reflect the clinical situation at the time of the requested service, and b) 
sufficiently document the ordering provider’s clinical intent.  
If these elements are not established with respect to a given request, the determination of appropriateness will 
most likely require a peer-to-peer conversation to understand the individual and unique facts that would justify a 
finding of clinical appropriateness. During the peer-to-peer conversation, factors such as patient acuity and setting 
of service may also be taken into account to the extent permitted by law.  
Genetic tests not specifically mentioned in the guidelines are considered not medically necessary. 
Simultaneous Ordering of Multiple Diagnostic or Therapeutic Interventions 
Requests for multiple diagnostic or therapeutic interventions at the same time will often require a peer-to-peer 
conversation to understand the individual circumstances that support the medical necessity of performing all 
interventions simultaneously. This is based on the fact that appropriateness of additional intervention is often 
dependent on the outcome of the initial intervention. 
Additionally, either of the following may apply: 
• Current literature and/or standards of medical practice support that one of the requested diagnostic or 
therapeutic interventions is more appropriate in the clinical situation presented; or  
• One of the diagnostic or therapeutic interventions requested is more likely to improve patient outcomes 
based on current literature and/or standards of medical practice. 
Repeat Diagnostic Intervention 
In general, repeated testing of the same anatomic location for the same indication should be limited to evaluation 
following an intervention, or when there is a change in clinical status such that additional testing is required to 
determine next steps in management. At times, it may be necessary to repeat a test using different techniques or 
protocols to clarify a finding or result of the original study. 
Repeated testing for the same indication using the same or similar technology may be subject to additional review 
or require peer-to-peer conversation in the following scenarios:  
• Repeated diagnostic testing at the same facility due to technical issues 

Somatic Tumor Testing

• Repeated diagnostic testing requested at a different facility due to provider preference or quality 
concerns 
• Repeated diagnostic testing of the same anatomic area based on persistent symptoms with no clinical 
change, treatment, or intervention since the previous study 
• Repeated diagnostic testing of the same anatomic area by different providers for the same member over 
a short period of time 
Repeat Therapeutic Intervention 
In general, repeated therapeutic intervention in the same anatomic area is considered appropriate when the prior 
intervention proved effective or beneficial and the expected duration of relief has lapsed. A repeat intervention 
requested prior to the expected duration of relief is not appropriate unless it can be confirmed that the prior 
intervention was never administered. Requests for ongoing services may depend on completion of previously 
authorized services in situations where a patient’s response to authorized services is relevant to a determination 
of clinical appropriateness.

Somatic Testing of Solid Tumors 
Clinical Indications 
General Requirements  
Repeated testing of the same individual for the same indication should be limited to evaluation following an 
intervention, or when there is a change in clinical status such that additional testing is required to determine next 
steps in management. At times, it may be necessary to repeat a test using different techniques or protocols to 
clarify a finding or result of the original study. 
Repeated testing for the same indication using the same or similar technology may be subject to additional review 
or require peer-to-peer conversation in the following scenarios:  
• Repeated diagnostic testing of the same tumor site with no clinical change, treatment, or intervention 
since the previous study 
• Repeated diagnostic testing of the same individual and the same tumor by different providers over a 
short period of time 
Umbrella Criteria 
Somatic Genomic Testing (Tumor Biomarker Testing)  
Somatic genomic testing is considered medically necessary in individuals with cancer when ALL of the following 
criteria are met: 
• The genomic testing has established analytical and clinical validity (i.e., FDA-approved test, when 
available) and is performed in an appropriately certified laboratory 
• The genetic test has established clinical utility such that a positive or negative result will meaningfully 
impact the clinical management (predictive, diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic) of the individual and 
will likely result in improvement in net health outcomes (i.e., the health benefits of the interventions 
outweigh any medical or psychological harmful effects of the testing intervention) 
o When there are genomic biomarker-linked therapies approved by the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) or recommended by NCCN as a Category 2A for the individual’s specific 
cancer scenario and such therapies are being considered in the near term 
o When considering a treatment for which there are specific genomic biomarker-based 
contraindications or exclusions related therapeutic decisions being considered in the near term 
• Clinical decision making incorporates the known or predicted impact of a specific genomic alteration on 
protein expression or function and published clinical data on the efficacy of targeting that genomic 
alteration with a particular agent 
Rationale 
Nearly every malignancy will have somatic mutations that have been described, although most known mutations do not have 
clinical management implications. While various common conditions are covered by specific guideline criteria for somatic 
testing of tumors, it is not feasible to establish criteria for every clinical scenario in oncology and hematology. The general 
criteria for somatic testing (above) apply to malignancy when more specific criteria may or may not be available.

Metastatic or Advanced Cancer (Tissue Agnostic Testing)  
Tissue-agnostic testing for patients with advanced solid tumors 
Multi-gene panel testing is considered medically necessary when ALL of the following are true: 
• The individual has a metastatic or advanced solid tumor and adequate performance status for cancer 
treatment 
• A genomic biomarker-linked therapy has been approved by the FDA or is recommended by NCCN as a 
Category 2A for the individual’s specific clinical scenario, or there are established genomic biomarker-
based treatment contraindications or exclusions  
• There are no existing indications for the planned therapy such that its use does not depend on the results 
of genetic testing (i.e., immune checkpoint inhibitor indications) 
• There are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available 
• Testing falls into ANY of the following categories: 
o Mismatch-repair (MMR) deficiency 
▪ MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, PMS2 or EPCAM genes by PCR or NGS testing 
▪ Microsatellite testing (MSI) and/or dMMR testing 
▪ MLH-1 promoter methylation and/or BRAF V600E mutation testing with nuclear 
expression loss of MLH1 and PMS2 by immunohistochemistry  
o Tumor mutational burden (TMB) testing as determined by an FDA-approved test with reporting 
using the threshold of ≥10 mutations/megabase (mut/Mb) 
o NTRK and RET fusion testing  
o BRAF V600E mutation testing 
Rationale 
Oncologists have traditionally chosen therapies and determined prognoses based on site of origin and histology. In select 
tumor types, oncologists began incorporating biomarkers, such as immunohistochemistry (IHC) for HER2 and 
estrogen/progesterone receptor status in breast cancer into their decision-making.
1
 Today, genomic characterization is 
increasingly being used to guide treatment decisions, especially in patients with advanced disease. Large-scale sequencing 
studies such as those of The Cancer Genome Atlas and the International Cancer Genome Consortium have described the 
genomic landscape of 20-30 solid tumor types, identifying certain alterations as drivers. Subsequent studies have defined a 
consensus list of cancer driver genes and patterns of co-occurrence and mutual exclusivity of these alterations.
2
 Studies of 
comprehensive next-generation sequencing (NGS) testing in patients with advanced cancer report a wide range of clinically 
actionable genomic alterations per patient, ranging from 40% to 94%. Furthermore, only 10%-25% of patients actually receive 
therapy informed by sequencing.
3
 The only randomized clinical trial to explore the clinical effects of delivering genomically 
directed therapy to patients undergoing NGS testing in the setting of advanced cancer found no improvement in progression-
free survival for patients receiving molecularly matched therapy.
4
 Additionally, INFORM, a pediatric registry explored whether 
biomarkers other than ALK, NTRK, or BRAF might be associated with progression-free survival (PFS) or overall survival (OS) 
benefit when treated with matched targeted therapy (MTT), and did not find evidence of survival benefit with other molecular 
findings.
5
 Thus, rather than systematic NGS testing in all advanced cancer patients, the current standard of care involves 
somatic testing applied in various specific tumor scenarios where such testing is known to be important because of driver 
alterations that are effectively treated with targeted agents.  
In addition to the specific tumor scenarios where NGS testing is indicated, the FDA has also approved the use of treatment 
regimens for tissue-agnostic indications in several specific scenarios where patients have progressed following previous 
treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatments: pembrolizumab for patients with microsatellite instability (since 
2017) or high tumor mutational burden (since 2020), larotrectinib (since 2018) or entrectinib (since 2019) for use in patients 
harboring tumors with NTRK fusions, and dabrafenib plus trametinib (since 2022) when the tumor harbors a BRAF V600E 
mutation.  
Microsatellite instability (MSI) is the result of inactivation of the DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system and is characterized by a 
high frequency of frameshift mutations in microsatellite DNA. In a portion of tumors, MSI is caused by germline mutations in

one of the MMR genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, or PMS2), which results in hereditary Lynch syndrome. However, the majority 
(80%) of MSI cases are sporadic, often because of hypermethylation of the MLH1 gene promoter.
6
 Given this, with MLH1 and 
PMS2 mismatch repair deficiency (dMMR), BRAF V600E mutation and/or MLH1 promoter methylation testing can be 
conducted to further identify the need for additional germline testing. 
7, 8
The diagnosis of microsatellite instability (MSI) and 
dMMR status is made using two reference techniques: molecular biology (polymerase chain reaction) and 
immunohistochemistry, with 90% to 97% agreement between the two techniques; the sensitivity of next-generation 
sequencing–based algorithms may not be as robust as immunohistochemistry and polymerase chain reaction.
9
 The FDA did 
not specify which assay should be used to assess for mismatch repair or microsatellite instability, and the College of American 
Pathologists in collaboration with several other organizations have guidelines pending. In the draft guidelines, for patients 
being considered for use of checkpoint inhibitors with cancer types other than colorectal, gastroesophageal, small bowel or 
endometrial cancer, the recommendation is that pathologists should test MMR genes for DNA mismatch repair, although the 
optimal approach is unknown. Overall, DNA mismatch repair is found in roughly 4% of all adult cancer.
6
  
The FDA granted tissue-agnostic accelerated approval in June 2020 for the anti-PD-1 pembrolizumab in TMB ≥10 
mutations/Mb solid tumors as determined by an FDA-approved test, for patients that have progressed following prior treatment 
and who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. TMB testing is based on the underlying assumption that increasing 
the numbers of mutant proteins will create antigenic peptides allowing for enhanced immunogenicity.
10
 The conceptual 
definition of TMB is total number of mutations present in a tumor specimen. The actual definition of the type of genetic 
alterations considered for TMB has varied according to different methodologies.
11
 The FoundationOneCDx assay (Foundation 
Medicine, Inc., CPT 0037U) was FDA-approved as a companion diagnostic. The MSK-IMPACT test was cleared through the 
FDA 510(k) process in 2017 and in the following years other NGS panels have been approved this way too. The Foundation 
Medicine TMB assay uses a tissue-based specimen and examines a genomic region of approximately 1.1 Mb. For TMB 
estimation this test includes synonymous and non-synonymous mutations and short indels, while oncogenic drivers are 
excluded. In addition, germline alterations are excluded based on validated bioinformatics algorithms. There are at least many 
other TMB tests in the market, including tests from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK-IMPACT), Tempus, 
Qiagen, Neogenomics, Illumina, Guardant Health, Caris, Thermo-Fisher Scientific, and others. Each lab tests a different 
number of genes, covers a different total region of the genome, and some use only nonsynonymous mutations. Each test uses 
its own bioinformatics algorithm and the type of specimens used also varies. The equivalence of 10 mut/Mb in FoundationOne 
CDx cannot be easily determined in other TMB panels. For example, the cutoff of high TMB for the MSK-IMPACT assay was 
defined at 13.8 mut/Mb based on their cohort,
12
 while the TAPUR trial defined high tumor mutational burden (HTMB) as ≥9 
mut/Mb.
13
 Further alignment in the numerical cutoff of TMB across panels requires calibration tools and reference datasets or 
materials. The variation between TMB estimates can confuse clinicians and may hinder clinical decision making.
14
  
The decision for the FDA to provide accelerated approval drew mixed reactions from the oncology community. On one hand, 
this was seen as a positive development because of the strong biological rationale for high TMB as a biomarker for 
immunotherapy sensitivity, and this was felt to address an unmet need for patients with rare cancer types to improve their 
access to immunotherapy.
15
 Critics noted that 10 mut/Mb is an arbitrary cut off that does not separate responders from non-
responders and it has not been shown to be associated with improved overall survival or quality of life. Additionally, there were 
concerns that there is insufficient evidence across tumor types for which pembrolizumab was not already approved and 
insufficient evidence to know if pembrolizumab is more cost effective than alternatives.
16
 PD-L1 expression and TMB are not 
significantly correlated within most cancer subtypes, and TMB may not always correlate with ICI responsiveness.
11
 Data 
examined from over 10,000 patients included in the Cancer Genome Atlas with TMB measured by the FoundationOne CDx 
assay failed to support the use of TMB-H as a biomarker for immune checkpoint blockade treatment in all tumor types, 
including at the FDA-approved threshold of 10 mut/Mb.
10
 There are still many challenges for the further development of TMB 
as biomarker with clinical utility. Prospective randomized trials are required to establish the roles of TMB and other ICI 
biomarkers in a variety of clinical settings. For instance, the predictive value of TMB for combinations of immunotherapies with 
targeted agents or chemotherapy is not established. 
Members of the neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusion oncogene family, NTRK1/NTRK2/NTRK3, are most 
prevalent in rare adult cancer types and in several pediatric cancers, although they can occur in a very small proportion of 
commonly occurring cancer types in adults, including NSCLCs, CRCs, head and neck cancers, thyroid cancers (especially in 
those with a history of radiation exposure, gliomas, inflammatory myofibroblastic tumors and some other sarcomas, and 
melanocytic tumors.
6, 17
 Evidence of how rare NTRK fusions are comes from an examination of tissue samples from 11,502 
patients where 53 gene fusions were analyzed and sequencing of 592 genes was done along with an IHC evaluation of 
TrkA/B/C. This review found only thirty-one cases (0.27% of the entire cohort) with NTRK fusions.
18
 Nevertheless, when NTRK 
fusions are found, larotrectinib and entrectinib have shown to have significant and durable activity against locally advanced 
and metastatic solid tumors with NTRK fusions.
18, 19
 Notably, this activity was seen regardless of tumor site of origin, histologic 
classification, or NTRK fusion type. As it relates to the RET fusion gene, the efficacy of selpercatinib was evaluated in the 
LIBRETTO-001 multicenter, open label, multicohort trial, which evaluated RET fusion-positive tumors (other than NSCLC and 
thyroid cancers) with disease progression on or following prior systematic treatment. The study demonstrated an objective 
response rate and duration of response of 43.9% and 24.5 months, respectively, which led to accelerated FDA approval.

Tumor types with responses included pancreatic adenocarcinoma, colorectal, salivary, unknown primary, breast, soft tissue 
sarcoma, bronchial carcinoid, ovarian, small intestine, and cholangiocarcinoma.
20
 
Immunohistochemistry (IHC) is commonly used for NTRK testing and is practical to implement in most laboratories. IHC has 
variable specificity according to tumor type. While the antibody appears to have 100% specificity in carcinomas of the colon, 
lung, thyroid, pancreas and biliary tract, decreased specificity is seen in breast and salivary gland carcinomas, as cytoplasmic 
staining can occasionally be seen. Specificity is lower in sarcomas, particularly those with neural or smooth muscle 
differentiation.
17
 Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) can detect large structural variants at the DNA level. A commercial 
break-apart probe is available for the ETV6 gene. NGS methods can also be used. NGS testing can be particularly useful for 
monitoring patients with NTRK fusions for development of resistance mutations. There are some limitations of using NGS 
testing, however. For example, the sensitivity of DNA-based NGS suffers if fusion breakpoints involve long intronic regions. 
Also, when novel structural variants are detected, it can be difficult to determine whether such an event results in a functional 
expressed fusion. Other drawbacks include turnaround time (typically several weeks, and that more material is required for 
testing. Selection of the appropriate assay for NTRK fusion detection therefore depends on tumor type and genes involved, as 
well as consideration of other factors such as available material, accessibility of various clinical assays, and whether 
comprehensive genomic testing is needed concurrently.
21
 When NTRK testing is applied across a broad range of tumor types, 
the yield is low and a very low proportion of tested patients benefit. For example, in a study conducted in the United States 
Veteran Affairs system, only 0.12% of all patients with solid tumors sequenced through the National Precision Oncology 
Program had evidence of an NTRK fusion or rearrangement. A retrospective analysis identified only 12 patients treated with 
TRK inhibitor therapy of whom none responded.
22
 
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group launched 
a collaborative project to propose a classification system for molecular aberrations based on the evidence available supporting 
their value as clinical targets and established from this work the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets 
(ESCAT).
23
 The ESCAT acknowledges that for the qualification of (ultra-) rare molecular aberrations it might not be feasible to 
obtain data from prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Tier I, consisting of targets suitable for routine clinical use, 
therefore has two subclasses with targets for which alternative evidence is available: tier IB includes "targets are supported by 
data from prospective, non-randomized clinical trials that, while unable to provide evidence for survival improvement, have 
demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit as defined by the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale”
23
 and IC includes 
targets for which "clinical trials in multiple tumor types, or basket clinical trials, have demonstrated a clinically meaningful 
benefit for the target-drug pair with similar magnitude of benefit across the different tumor types.”
24
 Based on ESCAT, NTRK 
fusions, high TMB status, and microsatellite instability (MSI) are typically ranked IC in this rubric for most solid tumors. 
The FDA granted accelerated approval in June 2022 to dabrafenib in combination with trametinib for the treatment of adult and 
pediatric patients ≥ 6 years of age with unresectable or metastatic solid tumors with BRAF V600E mutation who have 
progressed following prior treatment and have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. Dabrafenib in combination with 
trametinib is not indicated for patients with colorectal cancer because of known intrinsic resistance to BRAF inhibition. 
Mutations in BRAF occur in many tumor types and contribute to the dysregulation of processes such as cell proliferation and 
differentiation. Acquired resistance is common among patients receiving BRAF inhibitor monotherapies. Efforts to overcome 
this in BRAF V600 mutation-positive melanoma, NSCLC, and ATC have tested combined MEK and BRAF inhibition.
25
 The 
FDA approval was based on safety and efficacy evaluation in 131 adult patients from open-label, multiple cohort trials 
BRF117019 and NCI-MATCH, 36 pediatric patients from CTMT212X2101, and supported by results in COMBI-d, COMBI-v, 
and BRF113928. In addition, data have been published from the phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicenter, Rare Oncology 
Agnostic Research (ROAR) basket trial in patients with BRAF V600E-mutated rare cancers with promising findings found in 
thyroid cancer
26
, malignant gliomas
27
, and biliary tract cancer.
28
  
A further FDA action for a tumor agnostic indication occurred in September 2022 when selpercatinib was granted accelerated 
approval for adult patients with locally advanced or metastatic solid tumors with a rearranged during transfection (RET) gene 
fusion that have progressed on or following prior systemic treatment or who have no satisfactory alternative treatment options. 
This high selective RET-kinase inhibitor had previously shown efficacy in RET-positive lung and thyroid tumors, but it occurs 
rarely in other tumor types. A pre-specified interim analysis of LIBRETTO-001 was planned to investigate the efficacy and 
safety of selpercatinib in a tumor-agnostic population of patients with RET fusion-positive advanced solid tumors. The study 
found objective response in 18 of 41 patients. The most common grade 3 or worse treatment emergent adverse events were 
hypertension (ten [22%] of 45 patients), increased alanine aminotransferase (seven [16%]), and increased aspartate 
aminotransferase (six [13%]). Treatment emergent serious adverse events occurred in 18 (40%) of 45 patients. No treatment-
related deaths occurred.

Cancer-specific Criteria 
Bladder Cancer (Urothelial Carcinoma, including the Upper Tract) 
Gene expression profiling tests as a technique for urothelial cancer management and surveillance are considered 
not medically necessary for all indications. 
For multianalyte assays used for screening and diagnosis (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the 
Carelon Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing. 
 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for microsatellite instability (MSI by PCR) or mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR by IHC) is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven urothelial carcinoma of the bladder or upper urinary tract. 
• The individual has not had prior MSI or dMMR testing 
 
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing for FGFR variants is considered medically 
necessary for individuals with urothelial tumors of the bladder or upper urinary tract when ALL of the following 
criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven urothelial malignancy 
• The urothelial malignancy is locally advanced (stage IIIB), recurrent, or metastatic (stage IV) 
• The individual is a potential candidate for an FDA-approved targeted therapy prescribed on the basis of 
the FGFR test result 
• The individual has not had prior FGFR testing in the locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic setting 
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details.  
Rationale 
Bladder cancers are biologically diverse and can be separated into “molecular subtypes,” based on expression profiling.
29, 30
 In 
these molecular classification systems, over 90% of muscle-invasive bladder cancers classify as either luminal or basal-
squamous subtypes. These subtypes associate with clinical behavior, histology, and molecular alterations, though their clinical 
utility has not been demonstrated at present and use in bladder cancer is not recommended.
31
 Additionally, a guideline from 
the American Urological Association (AUA) and the Society of Urological Oncology (SUO) does not suggest a role for genetic 
testing in risk stratification or guiding management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.
32
  
Oncogenic alteration of FGFR3 is present in approximately 15% of muscle-invasive bladder cancers. The luminal subtype of 
bladder cancer is enriched in FGFR3 mutations and FGFR3 overexpression.
31
 Also, FGFR mutations are more frequent in the 
upper tract (≈30%) than the bladder (≈14%).
33
 A phase 2 study (BLC2001) in 99 patients with locally advanced and metastatic 
disease who did not respond to prior therapy found a 40% objective response rate with oral erdafitinib, a pan-FGFR inhibitor.
34
 
A global phase 3 trial of erdafitinib compared this drug with chemotherapy in patients with metastatic urothelial carcinoma with 
susceptible FGFR 3/2 alterations who had progression after one or two prior treatments including an anti-PD-1 or anti-PD-L1. 
Both progression-free survival and overall survival were longer with erdafitinib than with chemotherapy, and treatment-related 
adverse events leading to death were lower in the group treated with erdafitinib.
35
 An open-label, single-arm, phase II trial of 
another FGFR1-3 inhibitor, pemigatinib, reported that this drug demonstrated clinical activity in previously treated, 
unresectable or metastatic urothelial carcinoma with FGFR3 mutations or fusions/rearrangements.
36
 On January 19, 2024, the 
FDA-approved this drug for use in patients with advanced or metastatic urothelial carcinoma, with relevant FGFR alterations, 
whose disease has progressed during or following treatment with at least one line of prior systemic therapy, including in the 
adjuvant and neoadjuvant settings. Testing may be performed using the FDA-approved companion diagnostic (a specific RT-
PCR kit),
31
 For high risk, non-muscle invasive bladder cancer (NMIBC), the use of erdafitinib is also being explored for 
individuals with FGFR alterations.
37
 However, there has only been phase II data published in this setting and FGFR testing as 
a predictive biomarker for erdafinitib use is not guideline concordant and erdafinitib is not FDA-approved in that setting. The 

Somatic Tumor Testing

International Society of Urologic Pathology (ISUP) working group does not recommend testing all patients with advanced-
stage disease at the time of diagnosis. Instead, the IUSP recommends FGFR testing be performed more selectively, on 
patients with advanced disease who have progressed following platinum-based therapy, or who have another indication to 
perform testing, based on the judgment of treating physicians. Additionally, updated European Association of Urology 
guidelines on metastatic urothelial carcinoma also indicate that platinum-based chemotherapy is the recommended first-line 
standard therapy for all patients fit to receive either cisplatin or carboplatin. This guideline also notes that patients who are 
positive for programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1) and ineligible for cisplatin may receive immunotherapy (atezolizumab or 
pembrolizumab).
38
 Carelon Guidelines for FGFR testing are consistent with NCCN
39
 and European Association of Urology 
(EAU) guidelines.
40
  
In a series of patients with advanced upper tract urothelial cancer (479 patients) and bladder urothelial cancer (1984 patients), 
comprehensive genomic profiling revealed 0.7% of the bladder cancers and 3.1% of the upper tract cancers were MSI-H. 
FGFR3 activating mutations or fusions were found in 18% of the bladder tumors and 25.5% of the upper tract tumors.
41
 
American Urological Association and Society of Urodynamics, Female Pelvic Medicine & Urogenital Reconstruction jointly 
recommend against the use of urinary biomarkers in patients with a history of low-risk cancer and a normal cystoscopy AND 
the use of urinary biomarkers in place of cystoscopy evaluation for surveillance of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer 
(NMIBC).
42
 NCCN states that tumor marker evaluation during surveillance of high-risk NMIBC may be considered (category 2B 
recommendation) and states “it remains unclear whether these tests offer additional useful information for detection and 
management of non-muscle invasive bladder cancer.”
39
  
Brain Cancer (Malignant Glioma) 
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing is considered medically necessary for 
individuals with malignant gliomas of the brain when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven, primary malignant glioma of the brain 
• Genetic testing includes at least the following: 
o BRAF V600E  
o IDH1 and IDH2 
• The individual has not had prior testing for these genes 
 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for microsatellite instability (MSI by PCR) or mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR by IHC) is considered medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven, malignant glioma of the brain 
• The individual is under age 50 years and IDH wild type 
• The individual has not had prior MSI or dMMR testing 
Rationale 
Most primary brain tumors in adults are of glial origin. The average annual age-adjusted incidence rate for all glial tumors is 
5·95 per 100,000 people in the US, the majority being glioblastoma (3·23 per 100 000 people).
43
 The World Health 
Organization published the fifth edition of the Classification of Tumors of the Central Nervous System in 2021, updating the 
2016 version. This classification incorporates advances in understanding the molecular pathogenesis of brain tumors with 
histopathology. The previous broad category of adult-type diffuse gliomas has been consolidated into 3 types: astrocytoma, 
isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) mutant; oligodendroglioma, IDH mutant and 1p/19q co-deleted; and glioblastoma, IDH wild 
type. These major changes are driven by IDH mutation status and include the restriction of the diagnosis of glioblastoma to 
tumors that are IDH wild type.
44
 This revised classification has a substantial impact on the prognosis and management of 
patients, as well as on the design and conduct of clinical trials.
43
 
The appropriate molecular testing strategy for individuals with malignant gliomas depends on the specific tumor entity, the 
patient’s stage and clinical status, and available treatment options including clinical trials. While immunohistochemistry 
screening is used in certain restricted circumstances, NGS panels are a more efficient way to identify pathogenic variants that 
have diagnostic, prognostic, and/or predictive utility. In malignant gliomas, IDH1 and IDH2 mutation testing has both diagnostic 
and prognostic utility. IDH wild-type tumors have a worse prognosis compared to IDH-mutant tumors. MGMT hypermethylation 
is associated with better response to chemotherapy treatment. Mismatch repair deficiency is rare, occurring in fewer than 1% 
of patients overall, but it is relatively more common in individuals under age 50 who are IDH wild type.
45
 BRAF V600E has

value as a predictive biomarker in low grade glioma in children 
46
 with some preliminary data in high grade pediatric gliomas as 
well.
47
 It is used in adults to identify patients for clinical trials and sometimes compassionate use. In adults, an oral penetrant 
inhibitor of IDH was studied in the INDIGO trial showing a strong signal of progression-free survival improvement.
48
  
Despite tumor agnostic regulatory approval for NTRK fusion inhibiting agents in patients with NTRK fusions and of 
pembrolizumab in ‘tumor mutational burden high tumors, the evidence of benefit of these targeted treatments in CNS tumors is 
limited.
49
  
Breast Cancer 
Localized breast cancer; early adjuvant setting 
Gene expression profiling is considered medically necessary to guide adjuvant therapy* treatment-decision 
making for individuals with localized breast cancer using Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, EndoPredict, Prosigna 
Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay, or the Breast Cancer Index when ALL of the following criteria 
are met: 
• Surgery has been performed and a full pathological evaluation of the specimen has been completed 
• Histology is ductal, lobular, mixed, or metaplastic 
• Receptor status is estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), or both; AND 
HER2-negative 
• Lymph node status is node-negative (pN0) or axillary lymph node micro-metastasis (pN1mi) less than or 
equal to 2 mm 
• Tumor features include ANY of the following: 
o Tumor size greater than 1.0 cm and less than or equal to 5.0 cm 
o Tumor size 0.6–1.0 cm and moderately (histologic grade 2) or poorly-differentiated (histologic 
grade 3) 
o Tumor size 0.6–1.0 cm and well-differentiated (histologic grade 1) with EITHER of the following:  
▪ angiolymphatic invasion  
▪ high nuclear grade (nuclear grade 3) 
• Chemotherapy is being considered by the individual and their provider 
• No other breast cancer gene expression profiling assay has been conducted for this tumor (this includes 
testing on any metastatic foci or on other sites when the tumor is multifocal) 
Gene expression profiling with the Oncotype DX or MammaPrint is considered medically necessary for 
postmenopausal females and adult males (referring to the sex assigned at birth) with 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph 
nodes (pN1a, pN1b or pN1c) when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• Surgery has been performed, and a full pathological evaluation of the specimen has been completed 
• Histology is ductal, lobular, mixed, or metaplastic 
• Receptor status is estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), or both; AND 
HER2-negative 
• Chemotherapy is being considered by the individual and their provider 
• No other breast cancer gene expression profiling assay has been conducted for this tumor (including 
testing on any metastatic foci or on other sites when the tumor is multifocal) 
Localized breast cancer; extended adjuvant setting 
Gene expression profiling using the Breast Cancer Index (BCI) is considered medically necessary to assist with 
extended adjuvant therapy treatment-decision making for individuals with localized breast cancer when ALL of 
the following criteria are met: 

Somatic Tumor Testing 
© 2025 Carelon Medical Benefits Management. All rights reserved. 14 
• Receptor status is estrogen receptor positive (ER+), progesterone receptor positive (PR+), or both; AND 
HER2-negative 
• The individual is premenopausal at the time of the extended adjuvant decision-making 
• The individual has not been treated with ovarian suppression, an aromatase inhibitor, a CDK 4/6 inhibitor, 
or a PARP inhibitor 
Metastatic and/or locally advanced breast cancer 
Testing of tumor tissue for somatic pathogenic variants of PIK3CA, AKT1, PTEN, and ESR1 is considered 
medically necessary for postmenopausal females and adult males when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has ER-positive and HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer 
• The individual is a candidate for treatment per FDA-label with alpelisib or capivasertib plus fulvestrant, 
AND/OR the individual is a candidate for treatment per FDA label with elacestrant  
• The individual has not had prior tissue-based testing for the targeted gene(s) of interest in the 
metastatic setting 
Notes:  
*Adjuvant therapy refers to treatments early in the trajectory of treatment for localized breast cancer (e.g., within 
12 weeks of surgery) to reduce risk of breast cancer recurrence; this is distinct from extended-adjuvant therapy 
decision-making that takes places years after initiation of adjuvant treatment and involves a decision about the 
duration of treatment. 
Cell-free DNA testing (liquid biopsy) guideline criteria may apply; see Carelon Guidelines for Cell-free DNA 
Testing for the Management of Cancer. Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on 
the clinical scenario (e.g., there are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no 
indications for planned therapy that would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune 
checkpoint inhibitor indications], and progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for 
details. 
Rationale 
Adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
Breast tumors are routinely pathologically evaluated by immunohistochemical staining for the presence of ER, PR, and HER2 
overexpression. This information is used to make treatment decisions about hormonal and HER2-targeted therapy. Breast 
cancer occurs in individuals of any sexual or gender identity. Nearly all the relevant data used to guide treatment decisions are 
derived from studies that enrolled individuals assigned female sex at birth. Characterizing the tumor's gene expression profile 
allows for risk stratification for recurrence. Multigene expression assays are currently used in the care of more than one-third 
of females with breast cancer in the United States.
50
 These genetic profiling tests are used to assess the benefit of adjuvant 
chemotherapy for early-stage breast cancer and ASCO has published a guideline about the use of biomarkers for adjuvant 
endocrine and chemotherapy use since 2016. The most commonly used test for this purpose is Oncotype DX, a 21-gene 
assay. The sentinel TAILORx trial, which enrolled 10,273 females, established its clinical utility for use in females with lymph 
node negative early breast cancer. Results were published in 2018
51
 with earlier data about its prospective validation 
published in 2015,
52
 and subsequent data showing how other clinical data added to this test further refined its use.
51
 The 
RXPonder trial, a separate large clinical trial which enrolled 5,083 females, addressed the clinical utility of the Oncotype DX 
test in females with early stage, lymph node positive breast cancer.
53
 Moreover, the clinical utility of another multigene assay, 
the 70-gene signature MammaPrint, was evaluated in a prospective randomized trial (MINDACT) that was published in 2016. 
This trial included 6,693 females with node-negative or 1-3 node-positive, early-stage breast cancer.
54
 Patients were eligible 
irrespective of breast cancer subtype, but the majority had ER-positive tumors. Subsequent analyses of MINDACT further 
refinement of its use based on age.
55
 The most recent update of the ASCO guideline in 2022
56
 categorized these clinical 
scenarios based on the lymph node status (node-negative vs 1-3 positive nodes vs ≥4 nodes), age, menopausal status 
(premenopausal or age ≤ 50 years vs other), and HER2 receptor status. There is insufficient evidence in the realms of HER2 
positive disease and for patients with ≥4 nodes. There is high-quality evidence and a strong recommendation for use of 
Oncotype DX in node-negative females (regardless of age or menopausal status) and in those with 1-3 positive lymph nodes. 
For MammaPrint, the ASCO guideline indicates intermediate levels of evidence and strong recommendation for node-negative 
females who are postmenopausal, age ≥50 years, or those with 1-3 positive lymph nodes. For these same categories noted 
above for MammaPrint, a lower-level recommendation (moderate) was given to several additional tests including EndoPredict,

Prosigna, Breast Cancer Index, and use of non-genetic tests like IHC4 (which combines ER, PR, HER2 and Ki67 into one 
score) or the Ki-67 test. There is no current role for emerging biomarkers in this setting such as PD-L1 testing, evaluation of 
circulating tumor cells, or measurement of tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes.  
Extended adjuvant therapy for breast cancer 
The risk of recurrence for hormone receptor-positive breast cancer never goes away; it can recur post-5 years of adjuvant 
endocrine therapy.
68
 Extended hormonal therapy consideration is backed by trials like MA17, ABCSG, aTToM, ATLAS, IDEAL, 
and NSABP-B42, along with newer AERAS trial data demonstrating improved disease-free survival with extended 
anastrozole.
62
 ASCO guidelines suggest extended therapy offers modest added benefits with challenges of increased 
toxicity.
56, 69
 Decision-making includes risk of recurrence, treatment tolerability, and patient preference, with considerations 
including psychological and financial impacts.
70, 71
 The role of genomic testing in predicting extended adjuvant therapy benefits 
requires further prospective studies.
72
 
The Breast Cancer Index (BCI) test has been proposed as a tool to guide decision-making about extended adjuvant hormonal 
therapy in patients with hormone receptor-positive (HR+) early-stage breast cancer. However, recent evaluations and 
guideline updates reflect significant concerns about its clinical utility, prompting a reassessment of whether BCI should be 
deemed medically necessary for this purpose. The BCI test relies heavily on data from retrospective analyses. Studies by 
Noordhoek et al.
60
 and Bartlett et al.
59, 73
 evaluated data from the previously conducted IDEAL and aTToM trials, respectively, 
and described treatment to biomarker interactions to explore the value of the BCI for predicting endocrine therapy benefits. 
The Noordhoek study was positive, although only 53% of the eligible patients had BCI testing. The Bartlett study was negative 
in the overall population, but the node-positive subset was explored and emphasized as positive. The B-42 trial, presented at 
ASCO 2021 and finally published in 2024 by Mamounas 
74
, failed to confirm the predictive performance of BCI, casting doubt 
on the reliability of previous findings. Likewise, a similar study focused on the utility of the 70-gene MammaPrint assay for this 
same use as a predictor of benefit from extended adjuvant therapy was conducted from a sample of 1886 patients who were 
treated in the context of the B-42 trial and this study was also negative.
75
 Overall, the role of genomic testing as a predictor of 
benefit for use of extended adjuvant therapy remains to be established in prospective studies 
76
, results of prospective-
retrospective studies have been inconsistent, and it has not yet been integrated into multiple trials for extended adjuvant 
therapies. In 2024, the NCCN acknowledged limitations of the BCI data in a footnote but still considers this testing to be NCCN 
2A. ASCO guidelines
56
 acknowledge the BCI but similarly acknowledge with the same strength of evidence and strength of 
recommendation a free online calculator called the CTS5 
63
 to help guide clinicians in shared decision-making for 
postmenopausal patients in the extended adjuvant setting.  
The Breast Cancer Index has also been recently explored in a cohort of premenopausal women. The study was designed as a 
prospective-retrospective translational investigation utilizing tumor tissue samples from 1687 premenopausal women involved 
in the Suppression of Ovarian Function Trial (SOFT). Contrary to the study's hypothesis, patients with BCI-low tumors derived 
significant benefit from ovarian suppression therapy, while those with BCI-high tumors did not. This finding diverges from prior 
research where BCI-high tumors seem to suggest greater benefit from extended endocrine therapy in postmenopausal 
populations. The biological mechanisms underlying this discrepancy remain unclear, and the findings require validation in 
larger, independent cohorts to confirm the predictive and prognostic utility of BCI in this specific population.
77
 
Metastatic breast cancer 
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) Translational Research and Precision Medicine Working Group launched 
a collaborative project to propose a classification system for molecular aberrations based on the evidence available supporting 
their value as clinical targets and established from this work the ESMO Scale for Clinical Actionability of molecular Targets 
(ESCAT).
23
 The ESCAT acknowledges that for the qualification of (ultra-) rare molecular aberrations it might not be feasible to 
obtain data from prospective randomized clinical trials (RCTs). Tier I, consisting of targets suitable for routine clinical use, 
therefore has two subclasses with targets for which alternative evidence is available: tier I-B includes ‘targets are supported by 
data from prospective, non-randomized clinical trials that, while unable to provide evidence for survival improvement, have 
demonstrated clinically meaningful benefit as defined by the ESMO Magnitude of Clinical Benefit Scale and IC includes targets 
for which clinical trials in multiple tumor types, or basket clinical trials, have demonstrated a clinically meaningful benefit for the 
target-drug pair with similar magnitude of benefit across the different tumor types.
24
 Based on the current evidence, the ESMO 
Precision Medicine working group does not recommend routine use of large panel NGS testing on tumor samples for patients 
with metastatic breast cancer.
78
 HER2 amplification, germline BRCA1/2 mutations, and PIK3CA mutations were classified in 
tier of evidence IA based on large randomized trials showing antitumor activity of targeted therapies in patients presenting with 
these alterations. Neurotrophic receptor tyrosine kinase (NTRK) fusions and microsatellite instability (MSI) were ranked IC.
79
  
Genotype-driven targeted therapy using alpelisib has received regulatory approval and become part of routine clinical practice 
for PIK3CA-mutated ER-positive/HER2-negative metastatic breast cancer based on the Solar-1 trial data.
80
 Approximately 
40% of patients with ER-positive/HER2-negative disease have activating PIK3CA mutations. In Solar-1, the presence or 
absence of any PIK3CA mutation by means of polymerase-chain-reaction analysis of mutation hot spots in the C2, helical, and 
kinase domains of PI3K (corresponding to exons 7, 9, and 20, respectively) with the use of a tumor-tissue sample. In addition, 
genotype-targeted therapy using elacestrant in metastatic breast cancer individuals with ER-positive and HER2-negative 

Somatic Tumor Testing 
© 2025 Carelon Medical Benefits Management. All rights reserved. 16 
breast tumors has also received regulatory approval. This is based on the phase III Emerald Trial, an open-label trial that 
enrolled individuals with ER-positive/HER2-negative advanced breast cancer who had progressed/relapsed on or after one or 
two lines of endocrine therapy, one of which was given in combination with a cyclin-dependent kinase 4/6 inhibitor, and ≤1 line 
of chemotherapy for advanced disease. Estrogen receptor 1 (ESR1) mutations were defined as any missense mutation in 
codons 310-547.
81
 In addition, for patients harboring germline BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations, the use of olaparib (a PARP 
inhibitor) is now a standard treatment option based on data from the OlympiaAD trial.
82
 Based on these data, the presence of 
metastatic breast cancer is an indication for germline BRCA testing, although many patients have already undergone such 
testing by the time they develop metastatic disease since de novo metastatic breast cancer represents less than 10% of 
metastatic breast cancer and the indications for BRCA testing are broad.  
On November 16, 2023, the FDA approved capivasertib with fulvestrant for adult patients with hormone receptor (HR)-positive, 
HER2-negative locally advanced or metastatic breast cancer with one or more PIK3CA/AKT1/PTEN alterations, as detected 
by an FDA-approved test, following progression on at least one endocrine-based regimen in the metastatic setting or 
recurrence on or within 12 months of completing adjuvant therapy.
83
 Post-marketing approval was also given for the 
FoundationOne®CDx assay as a companion diagnostic test to identify patients with breast cancer for treatment with 
capivasertib with fulvestrant.
84
 The approval of capivasertib with fulvestrant was based on data from the CAPItello-291 trial, 
which reported significantly longer progression-free survival for capivasertib-fulvestrant compared to fulvestrant alone in 
patients with HR-positive advanced breast cancer whose disease had progressed during or after prior aromatase inhibitor 
therapy with or without a CDK4/6 inhibitor. This trial assessed patients with AKT-pathway-altered tumors, including PIK3CA, 
AKT1, and PTEN.
85
 An ASCO rapid guideline update was published in 2023 recommending multiple lines of endocrine 
therapy, frequently paired with targeted agents for metastatic hormone receptor positive and HER2-negative breast cancer 
patients, specifying that these choices should be informed by routine testing (using tissue or blood obtained at the time of 
progression) for activating mutations in ESR1, PIK3CA, or AKT1, or inactivation of PTEN.
86
  
Most therapies targeting kinase fusions are either still in clinical development or approved in tumor types other than breast 
cancer except for the NTRK inhibitors which received tumor-agnostic regulatory approval and would be an option for 4 out of 
4854 patients (0.08%) of patients with breast cancer (Hilbers). While somatic ESR1 mutations are a well-established 
mechanism of acquired resistance to aromatase inhibitors, clinical trials have demonstrated that these aromatase inhibitors 
combined with CDK 4/6 agents remain active in the presence of ESR1 mutations.
87
 Other biomarkers such as FGFR1/FGFR2, 
NFI, and tumor signatures (APOBEC) are still under investigation in clinical trials. Additional emerging biomarkers include 
HER2 activating mutations, somatic BRCA 1 or 2 mutations, and germline PALB2 mutations. The data regarding use of 
targeted agents for these mutations is promising but still limited.
66
  
Cholangiocarcinoma (Biliary Tract Cancers) 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for pathogenic variants in individuals with cholangiocarcinoma is considered 
medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven cholangiocarcinoma 
• The cholangiocarcinoma is locally advanced, unresectable, or metastatic 
• The panel testing to include analysis of pathogenic variants in these genes: IDH1, FGFR, and BRAF 
• The individual is a potential candidate for FDA-approved targeted therapy prescribed on the basis of the 
panel test results 
• The individual has not had prior somatic tumor testing for IDH1, FGFR, and BRAF in the metastatic 
setting 
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details. 
Rationale 
Biliary tract cancer refers to a spectrum of invasive adenocarcinomas, including cholangiocarcinoma (cancers arising in the 
intrahepatic, perihilar, or distal biliary tree), and gallbladder carcinoma. Identification of distinct patient subgroups with driver 
mutations amenable to targeted therapy have been identified, which are generally mutually exclusive from one another and 
often associated with the anatomical subsite of the tumor.
88
 The most common molecular alterations in biliary tract malignancy 
are found in IDH1 (mutations found in 13% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma cases), the FGFR pathway, particularly FGFR2 
mutations (20% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma), HER2 mutations (found in up to 20% of gallbladder and extra-hepatic 

Somatic Tumor Testing 
© 2025 Carelon Medical Benefits Management. All rights reserved. 17 
cholangiocarcinoma), BRAF V600E mutations (found in 5% of intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma). To identify these potentially 
targetable alterations, performing molecular profiling for patients diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma (especially intrahepatic 
cholangiocarcinoma) is now considered standard of care.
89
 Unfortunately, targeted therapies for patients with FGFR2 fusions 
or IDH1 mutations are often met with intrinsic resistance or a short durability of response owing to acquired resistance.
90
 Like 
other solid tumors, mutations in NTRK or MMR deficiency may also be found rarely and may also lead to use of targeted 
agents.
91
 
A majority of patients are diagnosed with advanced disease, when chemotherapy with cisplatin and gemcitabine followed by 
second-line chemotherapy is the cornerstone of treatment for most patients in the absence of targetable alterations. In adult 
patients with unresectable locally advanced or metastatic hepatocellular cholangiocarcinoma harboring IDH1 gene 
mutations—detected by an FDA-approved test—with disease progression after 1 to 2 prior lines of systemic therapy for 
advanced disease, ivosidenib is an FDA-approved treatment.
92
 For patients with FGFR2 fusions or other rearrangements, 
phase II single-arm registrational trials of FGFR inhibitors in the previously treated, unresectable locally advanced or 
metastatic cholangiocarcinoma population show an overall response rate in the 23%-42% range and a median progression-
free survival of 7 to 9 months and FGFR inhibitors such as pemigatinib and infigratinib can be used in this setting. Likewise, 
there is activity in treating patients with BRAF V600E mutations with dabrafenib plus tremetanib as well as use of entrectinib to 
treat those with NTRK inhibitors. HER2-directed therapies have some activity, albeit less convincing, in chemo-refractory 
patients.
89
 NCCN lists trastuzumab + pertuzumab as a subsequent-line therapy option for biliary tract cancers with disease 
progression, indicating that it is “useful in certain circumstances.” This is based on a multicenter, open-label, phase 2a, 
multiple basket study in which nine of 39 patients achieved a partial response (objective response rate 23%) and ten patients 
had serious treatment-emergent adverse events.
93
  
Colorectal Cancer 
Gene expression profiling tests as a technique for colorectal cancer management and surveillance are considered 
not medically necessary for all indications. 
For multianalyte assays used for screening and diagnosis (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the 
Carelon Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing. 
 
Universal Testing for all patients with newly diagnosed localized or metastatic colorectal cancer 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for microsatellite instability (MSI by PCR) or mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR by IHC) is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum 
• The individual has not had prior MSI or dMMR testing 
Localized colorectal cancer  
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing is considered medically necessary for 
individuals with localized (stage II-III) colorectal cancer when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum 
• Includes ANY or ALL of the following, with no prior testing  
o MSI testing by PCR and/or dMMR IHC testing  
o BRAF V600E  
o KRAS 
o MLH-1 promoter methylation (applicable when there is nuclear expression loss of MLH1 and 
PMS2 by IHC)

Metastatic colorectal cancer 
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing is considered medically necessary for 
individuals with recurrent or metastatic colorectal cancer and may be performed on the primary tumor or a 
metastatic site when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the colon or rectum 
• Assessment includes ANY or ALL of the following:  
o POLE/POLD1 mutations 
o Extended RAS testing (KRAS and NRAS exons 2,3, and 4) 
o BRAF V600E  
o HER2 amplification testing 
o MLH-1 promoter methylation (applicable when there is nuclear expression loss of MLH1 and 
PMS2 by IHC)  
• There has been no prior testing for these molecular aberrations 
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details.  
For multianalyte assays used for prognostication (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the Carelon 
Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing.  
Rationale 
Among people diagnosed with colon cancer, 20% have metastatic CRC, and 40% present with recurrence after previously 
treated localized disease.
94
 Among those with localized CRC, approximately 15% are deficient in one or more DNA mismatch 
repair (MMR) proteins, with one-quarter of these resulting from Lynch syndrome.
95
 About 90 to 95 percent of colorectal 
cancers in patients with Lynch syndrome show evidence of microsatellite instability (MSI).
96
 In patients with early-stage 
(especially stage II) CRC, MMR status provides important prognostic and predictive information, with MMR-deficiency being 
associated with both a good prognosis and a lack of efficacy from fluorouracil treatment.
97
 Additionally, neoadjuvant 
immunotherapy is associated with a high response rate and excellent safety profile in patients with early-stage dMMR CRC, 
highlighting the importance of dMMR testing in all newly diagnosed patients with CRC.
98, 99
  
Five percent of metastatic CRC tumors are MMR-D or MSI-H (either due to Lynch syndrome or sporadic mutations) and may 
respond to immunotherapy.
94
 All CRC (localized and metastatic) should be tested for either mismatch repair deficiency (MMR-
D) via immunohistochemistry or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) via polymerase chain reaction to screen for Lynch 
syndrome and/or to inform therapeutic options. In the metastatic disease setting, in addition to testing for microsatellite 
instability and MMR-deficiency, extended RAS testing has been the standard of care since the ASCO Provisional Clinical 
Opinion in 2015 based on evidence indicating that RAS mutations in exons 2 (codons 12 and 13), 3 (codons 59 and 61), and 4 
(codons 117 and 146) of both KRAS and NRAS are predictive of resistance to treatment with monoclonal antibodies (such as 
cetuximab and panitumumab) targeting the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR).
100
 These anti-EGFR antibody treatments 
should only be considered for treatment of patients with mCRC who are identified as having tumors with no mutations detected 
after such extended RAS mutation analysis. The randomized phase II PanaMa trial evaluated consensus molecular subtypes 
(CMSs) in patients with RAS wild-type mCRC receiving fluorouracil and folinic acid with or without panitumumab (Pmab) after 
Pmab + mFOLFOX6 induction. This study illustrated the importance of extended RAS testing as a predictive and prognostic 
biomarker.
101
  
On January 19, 2023, the FDA granted accelerated approval to tucatinib in combination with trastuzumab for RAS wild-type 
HER2-positive unresectable or metastatic colorectal cancer that has progressed following fluoropyrimidine-, oxaliplatin-, and 
irinotecan-based chemotherapy. This approval was based on data from the MOUNTAINEER trial, which reported clinically 
significant anti-tumor activity in patients receiving 3
rd
 line treatment or beyond for HER2-positive, RAS wild-type unresectable 
or metastatic CRC.
102
  
Guidelines from the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) include POLE/POLD1 testing for patients with recurrent 
or metastatic CRC.
103, 104
 BRAF V600E mutation is also routinely tested in metastatic colorectal cancer. This mutation leads to 
constitutive BRAF kinase activity and sustained MAPK pathway signaling in colon cancer. Other activating mutations in BRAF 
in CRC are very rare. The prevalence of this mutation is about 5%–10% in mCRC. BRAF mutation tumors have been

associated with female gender, advanced age, proximal colon tumor location, T4 tumors, and poor response to standard 
chemotherapy.
105, 106
 In the BEACON study, BRAF and MEK directed therapy with encorafenib plus cetuximab improved 
overall survival and overall response rates in the metastatic setting after one or two lines of prior therapy compared with 
standard palliative chemotherapy.
107
 Seven clinical trials from the ACCENT/IDEA database were analyzed and highlighted the 
utility of KRAS and BRAF V600E testing in prognostication and, in some cases, pursuit of clinical trials in high-risk patients.
108
 
Another biomarker under exploration is HER2 testing. The frequency of HER2 overexpression among patients with CRC is 
known to be around 5%, and HER2 overexpression/amplification has been associated with worse progression-free survival 
and overall survival in patients with RAS wild-type metastatic CRC who received anti-EGFR therapy.
109
 Thus far, phase II trials 
evaluating HER2 targeted therapy have produced mixed results, but such therapy is active when RAS and BRAF are wild-type 
and several clinical trials are ongoing.
110
 Finally, NTRK gene fusions are extremely rare, occurring in approximately 0.35% of 
colorectal cancer and are more frequently found among patients with MMR-D tumors.
111
 Lastly, as it relates to BRAF and 
KRAS testing in the localized stage II-III CRC setting, some studies have suggested some prognostic value in performing one 
or both.
56, 112
 Guidelines from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) highlight the role of molecular testing in the 
treatment algorithms for colorectal cancer, including a focus on dMMR/MSI, RAS, and BRAF status as well as HER2 status in 
RAS-wt patients.
113
 Another emerging testing method marketed for colorectal cancer is gene expression analysis. Guidelines 
from NCCN question the added value of prognostic genetic tests for colon cancer and cite insufficient data to recommend its 
use to estimate recurrence risk or determine adjuvant therapy.
103
  
Endometrial Carcinoma 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for microsatellite instability (MSI by PCR) or mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR by IHC) is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
•  The individual has biopsy-proven endometrial carcinoma 
•  The individual has not had prior MSI or dMMR testing 
 
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing is considered medically necessary for 
individuals with endometrial carcinoma and may be performed on the primary tumor or a metastatic site when 
ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven endometrial carcinoma  
• Assessment includes the following, as applicable:  
o MLH-1 promoter methylation (applicable when there is nuclear expression loss of MLH1 and 
PMS2 by IHC) 
o POLE mutation testing (NGS) 
o P53 mutation testing (NGS or IHC) 
• There has been no prior testing for these molecular aberrations 
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details. Additionally, for MLH1 germline 
testing for Lynch Syndrome, please refer to the Carelon Guidelines for Hereditary Cancer Testing.  
Rationale 
The FDA previously approved both the VENTANA MMR RxDx Panel and FoundationOne CDx as companion diagnostic 
devices to select patients with dMMR and MSI-H solid tumors, respectively, to identify individuals who are eligible for treatment 
with pembrolizumab. Approval was based on KEYNOTE-158—a multicenter, non-randomized, open-label, multi-cohort trial, 
which examined individuals with unresectable or metastatic MSI-H or dMMR endometrial carcinoma within two cohorts. 
Patients received pembrolizumab 200 mg intravenously every 3 weeks until unacceptable toxicity or documented disease 
progression. The objective response rate was 48% with a median progression-free survival of 13.1 months. The results 
demonstrated robust antitumor activity and enhanced survival outcomes in individuals receiving pembrolizumab with MSI-
H/dMMR endometrial cancers.
114
 As it relates to Lynch syndrome, loss of IHC nuclear expression of MLH1 may be due to 
Lynch syndrome or methylation of the MLH1 promoter region, as occurs in sporadic MSI carcinoma. Loss of nuclear 
expression of MHL1 and PMS2 by IHC should be triaged for MLH1 methylation studies. The presence of MLH1 methylation 

Somatic Tumor Testing

suggests a sporadic tumor rather than a germline mutation, and further germline testing is likely not indicated. Absence of 
MLH1 methylation suggests Lynch syndrome and germline testing for MLH1 is indicated. Loss of nuclear expression of MSH2 
and MSH6, loss of MSH6 only, or loss of PMS2 only all have a high probability of Lynch syndrome and genetic counseling 
should be considered.
115, 116
 Evolving roles of other prognostic-molecular subgroups that have received attention include 
ultramutated DNA polymerase epsilon (POLE-mut) and p53 (p53abn) variants, which were identified as part of the Cancer 
Genome Atlas (TCGA) study—they are associated with good and poor prognoses, respectively.
117
 Since the identification of 
these TCGA subgroups, further studies have attempted to evaluate the association between variants and histologic features, 
as well as their clinical utility. Data from the PORTEC-1 and PORTEC-2 trials showed that at 5 years, there were no 
locoregional recurrences in POLE-mutant endometrial cancer regardless of adjuvant radiotherapy; there was similar 
locoregional recurrence-free survival in mismatch repair-deficient endometrial cancer after EBRT, vaginal brachytherapy 
(VBT), and no adjuvant therapy; there was significantly better locoregional recurrence-free survival in p53-abnormal 
endometrial cancer with EBRT compared with VBT and no adjuvant therapy; and there was significantly better locoregional 
recurrence-free survival in endometrial cancer with no specific molecular profile, with both EBRT and VBT compared with no 
adjuvant therapy. This highlights the importance of molecular-risk profiling in directing treatment.
118
 The ongoing PORTEC-4a 
randomized phase III trial study is examining the impact of molecular-risk profiling-directed standard/individualized adjuvant 
treatment in high-intermediate risk endometrial cancer, although results are yet to be reported.
117, 119, 120
 Results from an 
earlier PORTEC-3 trial suggested that pathogenic mutations of p53 was associated with a beneficial 5-year recurrence-free 
survival rate with chemotherapy versus radiotherapy alone (59% versus 36%) in high-risk endometrial cancer.
121
 Given this 
evolving field, routine testing for these latter two subgroup variants is now reflected in nationally recognized guidelines.
122
 
Melanoma 
Prognostic testing in melanoma 
Gene expression profiling of established cutaneous, mucosal, or uveal melanoma for prognostication is 
considered not medically necessary. 
For multianalyte assays used for screening and diagnosis (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the 
Carelon Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing.  
 
Somatic tumor testing in advanced melanoma 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for BRAF V600E pathogenic variant by validated IHC, PCR, or NGS methods 
for individuals with resectable or unresectable high-risk stage IIC, stage III or stage IV cutaneous melanoma is 
considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven cutaneous malignant melanoma 
• Prior testing has not been performed  
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for individuals with resectable or unresectable high-risk stage IIC, stage III or 
stage IV melanoma that is BRAF V600E wild-type or mucosal melanoma is considered medically necessary 
when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven malignant melanoma 
• Prior testing has not been performed  
• Testing includes ANY or ALL of the following: 
o KIT variant testing  
o NRAS variant testing  
o Additional BRAF variant testing  
Testing of individuals with metastatic uveal melanoma for HLA-A*0201 is considered medically necessary 
when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven uveal melanoma and evidence of metastatic disease 
• Prior testing for HLA-A*0201 has not been performed 

Somatic Tumor Testing

• The individual is a candidate for treatment with tebentafusp 
*Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details.  
Rationale 
Diagnosis of indeterminate melanocytic lesions 
Light microscopic evaluation by a trained pathologist can provide an accurate diagnosis for the great majority of melanocytic 
lesions. There is, however, a small subset of melanocytic lesions that eludes appropriate classification by conventional light 
microscopy alone, preventing accurate prediction of clinical behavior and recommendations for appropriate treatment.
123
 
Ancillary tests such as comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), have been 
developed to help guide the diagnosis of ambiguous melanocytic proliferations. Although sometimes used, the correlation 
between various patterns of chromosomal abnormalities and outcomes are yet unclear.
123
  
Prognostic classification of localized cutaneous melanoma 
There are numerous clinicopathologic features that are accurately associated with melanoma outcome for localized disease 
(e.g., Breslow thickness, ulceration, and tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes). Currently, prognostication based on pathologic 
features is quite robust.
124
 There is interest, however, in using gene expression profiling (GEP) to categorize localized (stage I 
and II) cutaneous melanoma according to risk of metastasis and to better guide clinical decisions such as when to consider 
sentinel lymph node biopsy or adapt the surveillance intensity. Gene expression profiling associates the expression levels of 
many genes with an outcome, such as melanoma recurrence. Current GEP tests largely assign the patient’s tumor to a 
specific prognostic class (e.g., class 1 vs class 2, or low risk vs high risk) rather than calculating a specific calculated 
survival.
124
 A published meta-analysis of the 31-gene GEP test focused on three selected studies plus data from a novel 
cohort of 211 patients showed that recurrence-free and distant metastasis-free survival rates were 91.4% and 94.1% for Class 
1A patients and 43.6% and 55.5% for Class 2B patients.
125
 The methodology of this meta-analysis was criticized by academic 
dermatologists due to a lack of a pre-specified protocol, lack of adjustment for confounders and missing data, incomplete risk 
of bias assessment, publication bias, and financial conflicts of interest among the authors who were also meta-analyzing 
studies they also co-authored.
126
 Overall, the clinical utility of GEP classifiers in this setting remains uncertain. A population-
based analysis using SEER data between 2016-2018 revealed only small absolute risk differences between the 31-gene 
tested cohort and an unmatched cohort
127
, and evidence remains lacking for the clinical utility for identifying such small 
difference for clinical decision-making. These GEP tests also need to be weighed against (or integrated with) the best 
available phenotypic models and other simple and widely available outcome algorithms.
124
 For example, numerous studies 
have identified risk factors that may be predictive of positive SLN in thin melanoma, such as ulceration, high mitotic rate, and 
younger patient age. These risk factors are easily determined and inexpensive, and are now referred to as adverse features in 
guidelines for use in clinical staging and workup.
128
  
Prognostic classification of uveal melanoma 
Uveal melanoma is a rare intraocular cancer that carries a 30%–50% risk of metastasis within 5 years of diagnosis. 
Metastases are observed most commonly in the liver and less frequently in the lungs and other organs. Post-treatment 
surveillance is based on individual judgement and consensus-based guidelines typically involves imaging to evaluate signs 
and symptoms as indicated, with consideration of blood testing of liver function and liver and chest, abdominal, and pelvic 
imaging every 6 to 12 months for 10 years. Patients considered high risk may be imaged more frequently, such as every 3 to 6 
months over the first 5 years.  
The risk of metastases from a uveal melanoma has traditionally been predicted based on the study of the morphologic and 
pathologic features of the tumor. Tumor thickness, diameter, location, presence of extraocular extension, and histopathology 
have been consistently shown to independently predict the likelihood of developing metastatic disease.
129
 Cytogenetic 
investigations show that monosomy 3 is the most frequent karyotypic abnormality and is present in approximately 50% to 60% 
of patients. Monosomy of chromosome 3 and additional copies of 8q have been correlated with reduced survival.
130
 A 
commercially available 15-gene expression profile (DecisionDX-UM®, manufactured by Castle Biosciences, Inc.) is marketed 
to predict metastatic risk based on primary-tumor biology. This gene expression profile was reported to assist in ultimately 
managing certain individuals with a less-intensive surveillance program, following a prospective study that looked at 89 
patients enrolled from 4 institutions who underwent testing and then based on the results were assigned into either a high- or 
low-risk category.
131
 It should be noted that conflicts of interest and financial biases existed, such as several authors who were 
either employees and/or shareholders of Castle Biosciences. Another uveal melanoma genetic test from Impact Genetics Inc. 
evaluates tumor specimens for complete or partial loss, duplications, or isodisomy of Chromosomes 1p, 3, 6, and 8 with 
genetic sequencing of the GNAQ and GNA11 genes is offered for select specimens.
129
 Importantly, no survival benefit from 
the early detection of asymptomatic disease in uveal melanoma has been documented. In view of the lack of evidence for the 

Somatic Tumor Testing

benefit of any specific surveillance strategy, particularly for late relapse, recommendations for these patients and their 
providers remain uncertain.
130
 Factors that are sometimes considered in decisions about surveillance include the patient’s 
enhanced emotional well-being, the potential to identify oligometastatic disease amenable to surgery or other local therapies, 
the hope for decreased morbidity from advanced disease, and identification of eligibility for clinical trials that assess novel 
therapies for advanced uveal melanoma.
132
 Multiple studies have shown that certain morphologic characteristics of melanoma 
tumors (size and location) independently predict metastasis, beyond the data provided by either chromosomal analysis or 
GEP. Clinicians must integrate the entire clinical picture, including tumor size, location, and tumor growth velocity when 
interpreting the results of genetic analysis of an individual uveal melanoma tumor.
129
 Ultimately, the selection of surveillance 
modality used varies according to local expertise and patient preferences.  
Somatic tumor testing for resectable or unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma 
The majority of melanomas have mutations in genes associated with the MAPK pathway such as BRAF, NRAS, or NF1. 
Activation of the BRAF kinase via mutation is the most common, occurring in 40%–60% of cases, with mutated NRAS, 
occurring in 15%–30% of cases.
133
 More than 90% of the BRAF mutations are V600E, with V600K mutations accounting for 
most of the remainder.
133
 Currently, BRAF mutation status is the only biomarker that predicts a therapeutic response in 
advanced melanoma and testing for BRAF V600E mutation is the current standard of care in the setting of resectable or 
unresectable stage III or stage IV melanoma and also highly recommended for resected, high risk stage IIC disease.
134
  
The main cutaneous melanoma subtypes are associated with different mutational landscapes: frequently mutated genes aside 
from BRAF include CDKN2A, NRAS and TP53 in cutaneous melanoma, NRAS, NF1 and KIT in acral melanoma, and SF3B1 
in mucosal melanoma.
134
 In metastatic uveal melanoma, testing for HLA-A*0201 by a specific assay used to identify patients 
who may be treated with tebentafusp (a bispecific protein directed to target glycoprotein 100 positive cells), which improved 
overall survival in a phase 3 trial.
135
  
NRAS mutations are present in 15% of melanomas and correlate with poor prognosis.
136
 BRAF-mutant and NRAS-mutant 
melanomas are sensitive to MEK inhibition, and the MEK inhibitor binimetinib has shown clinical activity in a controlled trial in 
the subset of patients with NRAS -mutant metastatic melanoma.
137
 Moreover, c-KIT mutations are also common and found in 
about 15%–23% of mucosal melanoma, 10%–15% of acral lentiginous melanoma (ALM), and 6%–28% of melanoma arising in 
chronically sun-damaged skin.
138
 A review of 19 single arm studies of use of c-KIT inhibitors in unselected patients with KIT 
mutations or amplifications showed a response rate of 14% for mucosal melanoma and 22% for acral lentiginous melanoma, 
with activity in particular for mutations in exons 11 and 13 and minimal activity in KIT amplified tumors.
138
 Overall, for patients 
in whom the melanoma is BRAF wild-type at the V600 locus, testing for less common BRAF mutations and for NRAS and c-
KIT mutations is considered an ESMO evidence level IIC recommendation (suggesting that it is optional as there is insufficient 
evidence for efficacy).
134
 
Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer 
Gene expression profiling tests as a technique for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) cancer management and 
surveillance are considered not medically necessary for all indications.  
For multianalyte assays used for screening and detection (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the 
Carelon Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing.  
Localized (stage IB-IIIA) NSCLC 
Tissue-based somatic testing is considered medically necessary to identify EGFR and/or ALK pathogenic 
variant in individuals with localized NSCLC when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• Biopsy-proven, stage IB-IIIA NSCLC with ANY of the following characteristics: 
o An adenocarcinoma component on histology 
o Non-squamous, non-small cell histology 
o Squamous cell carcinoma histology when ANY of the following clinical features are present: 
▪ Age 50 years or younger  
▪ Those who never smoked cigarettes (<100 cigarettes in a lifetime) 
▪ Those who quit smoking >15 years ago 
• Test results will determine candidacy for treatment with osimertinib or alectinib 

Somatic Tumor Testing

Metastatic NSCLC 
Tissue-based NGS panel testing is considered medically necessary to identify pathogenic variants in individuals 
with stage IIIB, IIIC, or metastatic NSCLC when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• Biopsy-proven NSCLC with ANY of the following characteristics: 
o Any adenocarcinoma component on histology 
o Non-squamous, non-small cell histology 
o Squamous cell carcinoma histology when ANY of the following clinical features are present: 
▪ Age 50 years or younger  
▪ Those who never smoked cigarettes (<100 cigarettes in a lifetime) 
▪ Those who quit smoking >15 years ago 
• The multi-gene NGS panel testing contains, at minimum*, testing of appropriate molecular aberrations 
(mutations, rearrangements, fusions, or amplifications) in ALL of the following genes: EGFR, ALK, 
ROS1, BRAF, ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, MET exon 14 skipping, NTRK, and RET 
• The individual is a candidate for targeted therapy that may be prescribed based on the panel test results 
• The individual has not had prior NGS testing in the metastatic setting, unless BOTH of the following are 
met: 
o There is evidence of disease progression while on EFGR-targeted therapy 
o Tissue biopsy of a progressing lesion is being used for additional testing  
*Testing may be more focused if other techniques (such as IHC or FISH) are simultaneously (or previously) used 
for specific genes listed in the criteria that are not also included on the multi-gene panel. 
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details. 
For multianalyte assays used for prognostication (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the Carelon 
Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing. 
Rationale 
Metastatic non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has historically been classified by histology and treated with cytotoxic 
chemotherapy. However, in the past decade there has been improved understanding of the disease biology and oncogenic 
driver mutations. The modern treatment of NSCLC is characterized by molecularly defined subsets actionable with targeted 
therapies and immune checkpoint inhibitors. It is estimated that 35%–50% of patients with advanced non-squamous NSCLC 
harbor a targetable alteration
139, 140
, and selection of patients based on predictive biomarkers is associated with improved 
patient outcomes.
140
 Molecular testing of sensitizing EGFR mutations, BRAF V600E, as well as ALK, ROS1, is now standard-
of-care for patients with advanced NSCLC, as is testing for the EGFR T790M mutation upon resistance to first- or second-
generation EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy.
141
 Multiplexed genetic sequencing panels are preferred where available 
over multiple single gene tests to identify other treatment options beyond EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and ROS1. These larger panels 
include testing for specific molecular alterations in ERBB2 (HER2), KRAS, RET, MET, and NTRK genes.
141, 142
 New targetable 
alterations are continuing to emerge. Several targeted therapies have been approved for the treatment of metastatic non-small 
cell lung cancer, Included among these are tepotinib for adult patients with metastatic NSCLC harboring MET exon 14 
skipping alterations
143
, repotrectinib for patients with locally advanced or metastatic ROS1-positive NSCLC
144
, encorafenib 
with binimetinib for adult patients with metastatic NSCLC with a BRAF V600E mutation
145
, pralsetinib for patients with 
metastatic RET fusion-positive NSCLC
146
, and amivantamab-vmjw with carboplatin and pemetrexed for first-line treatment of 
locally advanced or metastatic NSCLC with EGFR exon 20 insertion mutations.
147
 Of note, the approval of amivantamab plus 
chemotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer with EGFR exon 20 insertions was based on data from the Papillon study.
148
 
Insertions in exon 20 are the third most common type of EGFR mutation, representing up to 12% of all EGFR-mutated 
NSCLCs. While this protocol involved collection of blood samples at baseline and follow-up testing and ultimately supported 
the FDA PMA application for Guardant 360 liquid testing, the Papillon protocol involved use of standard tissue biopsy and 
testing performed at a CLIA-certified lab. Thus, these data were not driven by liquid testing results—those samples were

collected as part of the investigational protocol. Thus, tissue testing remains a standard approach for exon 20 insertions and 
an acceptable approach for selecting patients for amivantamab plus chemotherapy. Overall, the newly approved targeted 
agents are reflected in the updated evidence-based guidelines for oncogene-addicted metastatic non-small cell lung cancer 
from ESMO.
149
 This ESMO guideline identifies the subset of patients with pure squamous cell carcinoma histology who may 
also benefit from molecular testing. Likewise, these new agents are highlighted in the ASCO living guideline for stage IV non-
small cell lung cancer with driver alternations which includes a table summarizing the evidence type, quality, and strength 
around 1
st
 and 2
nd
 line treatment choices when there are driver alternations found.
150
  
In contrast to metastatic non-squamous NSCLC, the management of early-stage non-squamous NSCLC does not involve 
routine testing for oncogenic driver mutations. However, for patients with stage Ib to IIIA NSCLC who are being considered for 
FDA-approved adjuvant therapy with osimertinib (an oral targeted EFGR inhibitor) based on results of the ADAURA study
151
, 
testing for EGFR exon 19 deletions or L858R point mutations is indicated. The ADAURA trial initially showed significant 
improvement in disease-free survival in patients treated with adjuvant osimertinib.
141
 More recent data indicate that use of 
osimertinib (a targeted agent used to treat EGFR mutated NSCLC) in the adjuvant setting for patients with resected stage Ib-
IIIA NSCLC is associated with clinically significant improvements in overall survival.
152
 In this scenario, EGFR testing using 
tissue specimens can be obtained before surgery or at the time of surgery. Meanwhile, preclinical and retrospective clinical 
data that support hypothesis testing of biomarker-driven treatment strategies in earlier stages of NSCLC with prospective 
clinical trials currently in progress.
153
 While neoadjuvant treatment targeted at EGFR mutations is being explored, it has not 
been established as effective with major pathological response rates of 15% in recently presented data, which are below the 
threshold expected.
154
  
There is a specific subset of patients with pure squamous cell histology who may benefit from molecular testing. The European 
Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) recommends against molecular testing in patients with a confident diagnosis of 
squamous cell lung carcinoma except in unusual cases such as a patient under 50 years of age, those who have never 
smoked (less than 100 cigarettes in a lifetime), or those who quit using all forms of tobacco more than 15 years ago.
149
  
In the setting of progressive disease while on EGFR-targeted therapy, there is a role for repeat NGS testing, which may inform 
mechanisms of resistance and subsequent treatment choices.
155
  
Ovarian Cancer (Epithelial)  
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing to determine HRD status by testing for 
pathogenic variants of BRCA1, BRCA2 with concomitant evaluation for genomic instability through an FDA-
approved test is considered medically necessary in individuals with locally advanced (stage III), metastatic 
(stage IV), or recurrent epithelial ovarian cancer when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven epithelial ovarian cancer  
• The individual does not have previously established pathogenic variants of BRCA 1 or BRCA2 through 
germline testing  
• The individual has not had prior testing that establishes HRD status in the locally advanced (stage III), 
metastatic (stage IV), or recurrent setting  
• The individual is a candidate for treatment with an FDA-approved PARP inhibitor 
Germline testing for pathogenic variants is considered medically necessary for all individuals with epithelial 
ovarian carcinoma. See Hereditary Cancer Testing guideline for further details.  
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details.  
Rationale 
The PARP inhibitor olaparib first received FDA approval in 2014 for females with germline mBRCA-associated (gBRCA) 
recurrent ovarian cancer. However, subsequent findings from clinical trials of PARP inhibitors have suggested that the 
importance of mBRCA as a predictive biomarker has diminished.
156
 For instance, among females without a germline mBRCA 
mutation, predictors of PARP activity include a somatic mutation in BRCA and evidence of homologous recombination 
deficiency. Indeed, FDA approval of the PARP inhibitor rucaparib in 2016 broadened the eligibility for PARP inhibitor treatment 
beyond gBRCA and included patients with somatic BRCA-associated ovarian cancers. In the subsequent Ariel3 trial, rucaparib 
significantly improved progression-free survival in patients with platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer who had achieved a 
response to platinum-based chemotherapy.
157
 A novel aspect of this trial was the prospective validation of the tumor-based,

NGS HRD test assay. Additionally, an exploratory analysis of progression-free survival in patients with BRCA wild-type and 
high loss of heterozygosity (LOH) or low LOH tumors revealed that patients with BRCA-mutant tumors did not solely drive 
rucaparib benefit in the HRD cohort or intention-to-treat population.
158
 The FDA approval of rucaparib in April 2018 included 
approval of a complementary diagnostic test for tumor samples to determine both BRCA and HRD status. ESGO-ESMO-ESP 
consensus recommendations in ovarian cancer also emphasize the importance of testing HRD status using clinically validated 
genomically validated genomic instability tests (Lederman JA, 2024; 38307807). This guideline emphasizes that non-BRCA 
homologous gene mutations (i.e., ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, CDK12, CHEK ½, FANCL, PALB2, RAD51 B/C/D, RAD54L, etc.) are 
not required. However, these genes are typically part of a large gene panel for commercially available tests that measure 
HRD.  
Other test methodologies are in development, including targeted gene capture assays to calculate a genome-wide loss of 
heterozygosity (LOH) score. This test methodology shows promise in high-grade non-clear cell ovarian carcinoma. However, it 
shows poor correlation with treatment outcomes and therefore is not an effective predictive biomarker.
159
 The Geneva test, 
which uses the Oncoscan FFPE Assay Kit plus the number of Large-scale State Transitions (LST), has also shown promising 
findings but is not an FDA-approved test at this time.
160
  
On November 14, 2022, the FDA granted accelerated approval to mirvetuximab soravtansine-gynx for adult patients with 
folate receptor alpha (FRα) positive, platinum resistant epithelial ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, who 
have received one to three prior systemic treatment regimens. This approval was based on data from the MIRASOL trial, 
which reported a significant benefit for this therapy compared to chemotherapy with respect to progression-free survival, 
overall survival, and objective response.
161
 However, FRα is an immunohistochemical test rather than a genetic test, and is 
therefore outside the scope of these guidelines.  
Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma 
Germline testing for pathogenic variants is considered medically necessary for all individuals with pancreatic 
adenocarcinoma. See Hereditary Cancer Testing guideline for further details. 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for microsatellite instability (MSI by PCR) or mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR by IHC) is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven pancreatic adenocarcinoma 
• The individual has not had prior MSI or dMMR testing 
 
Targeted (i.e., 50 or less genes) tissue-based somatic tumor testing is considered medically necessary when 
ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven locally advanced (stage III), metastatic (stage IV), or recurrent 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma  
• The NGS panel includes BRCA1, BRCA2, PALB2, KRAS, as applicable 
• The individual has not had prior NGS testing in the locally advanced, metastatic, or recurrent setting 
 
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details. 
Rationale 
Up to 10% of individuals with pancreatic adenocarcinoma have a pathogenic germline alteration. Individuals with BRCA1 or 
BRCA2 mutations or microsatellite instability (MSI) resulting from a pathogenic germline mutation or somatic mutation in DNA 
mismatch repair (MMR) genes.
162
 Affected individuals may benefit specifically from platinum-based therapies or PARP 
inhibitors.
163
 For this reason, individuals with newly diagnosed pancreatic cancer at any stage should have multidisciplinary 
evaluation and management, germline testing, and integrated supportive care.
164
  
The enthusiasm for use of PARP-inhibition as targeted therapy for patients with BRCA-mutated pancreatic cancer came from 
the POLO trial published in 2019, a trial that randomized 154 patients with metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma and 
germline BRCA mutation to maintenance olaparib versus placebo after 16 weeks of first line platinum-based chemotherapy.
165
 

Somatic Tumor Testing 
© 2025 Carelon Medical Benefits Management. All rights reserved. 26 
The POLO trial showed a statistically significant advantage in progression-free survival for olaparib (median 7.4 vs 3.8 months, 
hazard ratio 0.53). However, mature data have since been published showing no statistical or clinically meaning improvement 
on overall survival.
166
 Based on the absence of survival or quality of life improvement with olaparib and other concerns about 
the POLO trial design
167
, enthusiasm for the use of olaparib as maintenance therapy has declined. A phase II trial is underway 
exploring the role of another PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, for maintenance therapy in patients with advanced pancreatic 
carcinoma and germline or somatic mutation of BRCA1, BRCA2, or PALB2.
168
 These phase II data show that, like olaparib, 
rucaparib is active and tolerable. Ongoing randomized studies will further elucidate whether there are clinically meaningful 
benefits to using PARP inhibitors in the maintenance or adjuvant settings.  
Practice guidelines, including from the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO)
169
 and the National Comprehensive 
Cancer Network (NCCN).
170
 recommend somatic tumor testing, including BRCA and KRAS pathogenic variants as well as 
NTRK fusions, in the setting of advanced pancreatic cancer, noting the utility of such testing in treatment decision-making. 
Prostate Cancer 
Localized prostate cancer 
Gene expression profiling and genomic biomarker tests as a technique for prostate cancer management and 
surveillance are considered not medically necessary for all indications.  
For multianalyte assays used for screening and detection (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the 
Carelon Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing.  
Metastatic prostate cancer 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing for microsatellite instability (MSI by PCR) or mismatch repair deficiency 
(dMMR by IHC) is considered medically necessary when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
• The individual has not had prior MSI or dMMR testing 
Tissue-based NGS panel testing is considered medically necessary to identify pathogenic variants in individuals 
with metastatic prostate cancer when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• The individual has biopsy-proven adenocarcinoma of the prostate 
• The individual is a candidate for ONE of the following therapies: 
o FDA-approved PARP inhibitor (olaparib, rucaparib, or another PARP inhibitor approved for use 
in this setting) 
o FDA-approved PD-1 inhibitor (pembrolizumab or another checkpoint inhibitor approved for use 
in this setting) 
• The NGS panel includes BRCA2, BRCA1, and may also include other genes encoding molecules 
involved in homologous recombination DNA damage repair (DDR), such as ATM, BARD1, BRIP1, 
CDK12, CHEK1, CHEK2, FANCL, PABLB2, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, and RAD54L  
• The individual has not had prior NGS testing in the metastatic setting 
Germline testing for pathogenic variants is considered medically necessary for all individuals with metastatic 
prostate adenocarcinoma. See Hereditary Cancer Testing guideline for further details.  
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that 
would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details.  
Rationale 
Localized prostate cancer 
Prostate cancer is usually suspected on the basis of a digital rectal exam (DRE) and/or an elevated prostate-specific antigen 
(PSA) test. Definitive diagnosis depends on histopathologic verification. Abnormal DRE is an indication for biopsy, but as an 

Somatic Tumor Testing

independent variable, PSA is a better predictor of cancer than either DRE or transrectal ultrasound.
171
 The histologic grading 
system for prostate cancer drives nearly all management decisions in localized prostate cancer, with Gleason score 6 being 
nearly universally indolent up to Gleason score 10 which is almost certainly lethal in the long run.
172
 The decision to proceed 
with a further staging workup is guided by which treatment options are available, taking into account the patient’s preference 
and comorbidity. There are currently 10 or more pretreatment risk stratification tools for use in prostate cancer care, all of 
which use clinical and/or imaging factors without incorporating somatic genetic test information. The most commonly used are 
the D’Amico-derived systems (NCCN, NICE, GUROC, EAU, AUA) which involve categorization into 5 ordinal categories of 
risk: very low, low, intermediate, high, or very high. The Memorial Sloan Kettering nomogram, Cancer of the Prostate Risk 
score, and the Cambridge Prognostic Group are other systems and these perform slightly better in predicting prostate cancer 
death.
173
 Prognostic approaches are sometimes explored using other, surrogate endpoints such as time to radiographic 
progression assessed by blinded independent central review, development of distant metastases, risk of adverse pathology 
during active surveillance, and others. Ultimately, management decisions for localized prostate cancer are typically made after 
appropriate options have been discussed with a multidisciplinary team (including urologists, radiation oncologists, medical 
oncologists, pathologists, and radiologists), and after the balance of benefits and side effects of each therapy modality has 
been considered in shared decision-making with the patient.  
Numerous molecular biomarkers, particularly tissue-based genomic biomarker tests, have been developed to improve risk 
stratification and patient management. One of the unique challenges for use of these biomarkers is the complex spatial 
heterogeneity of prostate cancer.
174
 While few of these genomic panels have undergone extensive validation, there are 
several commercially available tests (Oncotype DX prostate, Prolaris, Decipher, and ProMark) that have been shown in 
retrospective analyses to provide additional information beyond standard clinical models in prognostication or patient selection 
for therapy.
175, 176
 Given the absence of prospective clinical trial data, NCCN and ASCO guidelines do not recommend routine 
ordering of any molecular tests to guide decision-making in localized prostate cancer regarding the role of active surveillance 
or the use of post-prostatectomy adjuvant versus salvage radiation therapy. The ASCO guideline on molecular biomarkers in 
localized prostate cancer emphasizes that there is a paucity of prospective studies assessing the short and long-term 
outcomes of patients when these biomarkers are integrated into clinical decision-making.
175
 These guidelines acknowledge 
that, based on lower level evidence and expert consensus, some specific molecular profiling biomarkers may be considered in 
specific situations in which the assay result, when considered as a whole with routine clinical factors, is likely to affect 
management. The most common settings where such testing is sometimes considered on that basis is with low or favorable 
intermediate risk localized prostate cancer in men with life expectancy over 10 years. One limitation of the data regarding use 
of these tumor tissue-based genomic biomarker tests for active surveillance is that the tests were all developed in cohorts of 
patients who had already undergone primary treatment and were higher clinical risk than those typically considered for active 
surveillance.
177
 Overall, it remains uncertain what prognostic endpoints should be prioritized and what magnitude of 
association with those prognostic endpoints are important. Nevertheless, in recent years, there has been more than 10-fold 
increase in tissue-based genomic biomarker testing related to prostate cancer with striking regional variability.
178
 Practice 
patterns also vary widely within regions.
179
 Issues surrounding clinician education and awareness of these assays (also 
referred to as “relationships with industry”) may have contributed to this rising pattern of use.
177
 The relative accuracy of these 
biomarker tests compared to other standard tests is unknown.
179
 Also, while prospective trials are ongoing, the impact on key 
clinical outcomes (survival, quality of life, or need for treatment) attributable to use any of these tissue-based genomic 
biomarker tests (in any specific setting) is also uncertain.
177
  
Metastatic prostate cancer 
Patients with metastatic prostate cancer have multiple treatment options with varied mechanisms of action beyond androgen 
deprivation therapy alone. Such options include androgen-receptor-targeted agents, taxane-based chemotherapies, bone-
targeted radiopharmaceutical radium-223, and biomarker-driven therapy with the immune-checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab 
(for those with mismatch-repair deficiency (dMMR) or microsatellite instability (MSI)) and the PARP inhibitors olaparib and 
rucaparib (for those with homologous-recombination gene deficiency). Olaparib was approved by the FDA on May 31, 2023, 
for adult patients with deleterious or suspected deleterious BRCA-mutated metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer 
(mCRPC), as determined by an FDA-approved companion diagnostic test. Such tests include BRCAnalysis CDX, Foundation 
One CDX, and Foundation One Liquid CDX. This was based on data from the PROpel trial, which showed that significant 
clinical benefit for Olaparib + abiraterone was restricted to the subset of patients with BRCA mutations.
180
 Practice patterns 
vary in terms of the sequencing of therapies for both castrate-sensitive and castrate-resistant patients, and also variation in 
responses between patients with any given therapy.  
The prevalence of recurrent genomic alternations varies across various prostate cancer clinical scenarios and also by 
published cohort. Common aberrations are typically not actionable and involve the androgen receptor (observed in >50% of 
cases); TP53 (in >40% of cases); genes encoding components of the PI3K pathway, such as PTEN (in 45% of cases); loss of 
RB1, which encodes the tumor suppressor Rb (in ~20% of cases); and others.
181
 ESCAT level I molecular aberrations are 
those that the match of an alteration and a drug has been validated in clinical trials and should drive treatment decision in daily 
practice.
78
 In this category, BRCA2, BRCA1, ATM and other genes encoding molecules involved in homologous recombination 
DNA damage repair ([DDR], such as PALB2, FANCA, RAD51D, CHEK2, and CDK12) are found in 20%-25% of cases and 
may prompt consideration of PARP inhibitors. Moreover, roughly 3%–5% of prostate cancers harbor evidence of DNA 

Somatic Tumor Testing

mismatch-repair deficiency (dMMR), hyper-mutation or increased microsatellite instability which may prompt consideration of 
PD-1 inhibitors.
181
 The ESMO Precision Medicine working group recommends multi-gene NGS panel testing in metastatic 
prostate cancer to assess for ESCAT level 1 alterations.
78
 Commercially available prostate-cancer specific NGS panels 
include 11-14 genes.
182
 A metastatic biopsy for histologic and molecular evaluation is the standard of care and preferred over 
ctDNA testing, which can produce false positive biomarker signals due to potential interference from clonal hematopoiesis of 
indeterminate potential (CHIP). It is noteworthy that MSI-H status and HRD are generally mutually exclusive phenomena 
across cancer types, but may rarely co-occur, especially in prostate cancer. Most BRCA mutations coexisting with 
microsatellite instability are likely bystander events that may not result in sensitivity to poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase 
inhibitors.
183
  
The pivotal clinical trials of PARP inhibitors in metastatic castrate resistant prostate cancer are the phase III Profound trial (for 
olaparib) and the phase II Triton2 trial (for rucaparib). In the Profound trial
184, 185
, there was a randomization to olaparib versus 
enzalutamide or abiraterone for patients who had either BRCA1, BRCA2, or ATM mutations (cohort A) or alterations in any of 
12 other HRD genes (cohort B). The statistically significant benefit in progression free survival (7.4 months vs 3.6 months, HR 
0.34) and overall survival (19.1 vs 14.7 months, HR 0.69) was limited to the cohort A patients. The phase II TRITON2 study of 
rucaparib included patients with mCRPC and deleterious BRCA or non-BRCA DNA damage-repair gene alterations treated 
after 1-2 lines of next-generation androgen-receptor directed therapy and 1 prior taxane-based regimen. In the BRCA mutated 
patients, the overall response rate was 43.5%
186
, and for those with non-BRCA DNA damage-repair alterations the responses 
were much lower for PALB2, FANCA, BRIP1 and RAD51B and non-existent for ATM, CDK12, and CHEK2.
187
 Subsequent 
studies include TRITON3, which showed that testing for BRCA mutations and treating castrate-resistant patients who had 
progressed on a second-generation androgen receptor pathway inhibitor (ARPI) have median imaging-based PFS 
improvements of slightly less than 5 months, supporting the value of BRCA testing in castrate-resistant prostate cancer.
188
 The 
ongoing phase III MAGNITUDE trial has thus far shown improved radiographic progression-free survival in patients with BRCA 
1/2-altered mCRPC when treated with niraparib plus abiraterone acetate with prednisone.
189
  
Thyroid Cancer 
Testing of indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITN) 
Use of next-generation gene expression classifier testing from fine needle aspirate sampling of a thyroid nodule is 
considered medically necessary when ALL of the following criteria are met: 
• There has been no prior testing of the same thyroid nodule 
• Initial cytopathology is reported as ANY of the following (Bethesda III or IV) categories:  
o Atypia of undetermined significance (AUS) 
o Follicular lesion of undetermined significance (FLUS) 
o Suspicious for follicular neoplasm (SFN) 
o Follicular neoplasm (FN) 
• The ITN is <4 cm in size AND does NOT have findings highly suspicious for malignancy on ultrasound 
(American Thyroid Association high suspicion pattern or American College of Radiology TIRADS 5) 
• ONE of the following gene expression classifiers may be used when performed as a stand-alone 
classifier test: 
o ThyGeNEXT/ThyraMIR multiplatform test 
o ThyroSeq Genomic Classifier 
o Afirma GSC 
Somatic genetic testing of thyroid malignancy 
Tissue-based somatic tumor testing is considered medically necessary for individuals with advanced thyroid 
carcinoma that is not amenable to radioactive iodine therapy when the following criteria* are met: 
• The individual has biopsy proven unresectable, locally advanced, recurrent, or metastatic thyroid 
carcinoma or anaplastic thyroid carcinoma (any stage) 
• The testing includes assessment for pathogenic variants of BRAF V600E, ALK, NTRK, and RET 

Somatic Tumor Testing

• The individual is considered a potential candidate for FDA-approved oral targeted therapy based on the 
results of this testing 
*See additional guidelines concerning tissue agnostic somatic testing or hereditary cancer risk testing depending 
on the clinical scenario. 
Rationale 
Molecular testing of indeterminate thyroid nodules 
Roughly 4%-7% of the population have palpable thyroid nodules and as much as 30% or more have ultrasound detectable 
nodules. Indeterminate thyroid nodules (ITNs) are a challenging problem because these nodules are frequently discovered but 
usually benign and not requiring treatment.
190
 The goal of care is to reduce overtreatment of such nodules and yet to detect 
and appropriately treat the proper subset of nodules that may cause morbidity or mortality due to thyroid malignancy. 
Fortunately, the majority of patients diagnosed with thyroid cancer are low risk for recurrence (<5%) and their risk of cancer-
related death is even lower.
191
 Indeed, recent studies have explored the role of de-escalation of treatment
191
 including active 
surveillance.
192
  
When a thyroid nodule is found, the standard of care is to perform fine needle aspiration of the nodule for cytopathology. The 
American Thyroid Association (ATA) updated its guidelines for management of ITNs in 2015, recommending using the 
Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid Cytopathology. This system includes six classifications: (I) nondiagnostic/ 
unsatisfactory; (II) benign; (III) atypia of undetermined significance/follicular lesion of undetermined significance (AUS/FLUS); 
(IV) follicular neoplasm/suspicious for follicular neoplasm (FN); (V) suspicious for malignancy (SUSP); and (VI) malignant. 
Notably, the Bethesda System replaces the traditional single “indeterminate” category with three classifications, AUS/FLUS, 
FN, and SUSP.
193
  
Molecular testing is an increasingly utilized adjunct when evaluating indeterminate thyroid nodules in an effort to avoid 
unnecessary surgical or diagnostic risk to a patient.
190
 The potential use of such tests is to improve risk stratification in the 
intermediate risk subgroups such as Bethesda III and IV groups. The second edition Bethesda System for Reporting Thyroid 
Cytology estimated 6%-18% malignancy rate of category III and 10%-40% for category IV nodules.
194
 A single institution 
retrospective cohort study noted in a 5-year review that malignancy rates at their institution of Bethesda III and IV surgical 
cases were 20%-25% with a fairly large range between years.
195
 In recent years, several commercial multi-gene classifiers 
have emerged that are intended to help classify these indeterminate nodules.
196
 One example is ThyroSeq v3, a third-
generation DNA, and RNA sequencing test which identifies mutations, gene fusion, gene expression alterations, and copy 
number variations. In contrast, the Afirma GSC, another third-generation classifier, is a machine learning derived classification 
system detecting RNA transcriptome expression, mitochondrial RNA, and genomic copy number alterations including loss of 
heterozygosity. Finally, a multiplatform test (MPT) approach that combines a mutation panel test (ThyGenX) and a microRNA 
risk classifier test (ThyraMIR) has also been shown to provide both high negative predictive value (NPV) and high positive 
predictive value (PPV) for malignancy when tested in indeterminate nodules.
197, 198
 Meta-analyses of the second generation 
molecular tests to assess ITNs indicated that the high sensitivity and high NPV of these tests are similar.
199, 200
 Of note, an 
altogether different classifier Afirma Xpression Atlas (XA) detects gene variants and fusions in thyroid nodule FNA samples 
from a curated panel of 511 genes using whole-transcriptome RNA-sequencing. Its intended use is distinct from those above 
focusing on cytologically indeterminate nodules that are Afirma GSC suspicious, Bethesda V/VI nodules, or known thyroid 
metastases.
201
  The clinical utility of the Afirma XA has not been demonstrated. Afirma XA is promoted for the management of 
cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules, particularly those classified as suspicious by the Afirma Genomic Sequencing 
Classifier (GSC). The XA test is used to detect gene variants and fusions to help with risk stratification and inform clinical 
decision-making. Babazadeh et al. reported that the Afirma XA test was predictive of follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer, with 
a positive predictive value (PPV) of 83.7% for nodules that were XA-positive, which is comparable to the PPV of GSC-
suspicious results alone.
202
 This suggests that while XA adds molecular detail, its overall predictive value for malignancy is 
similar to that of the GSC. Munoz-Zuluaga et al. found that the Afirma XA test improved risk stratification for GSC-suspicious 
nodules, with a 100% risk of malignancy in XA-positive cases that underwent surgery. However, a negative XA result should 
not be used as a rule-out test, as the risk of malignancy in XA-negative nodules was still significant at 42%.
203
 
Angell et al. provided analytical and clinical validation of the XA test, demonstrating high reproducibility and accuracy in 
detecting gene variants and fusions. The study highlighted that the XA test supplements the GSC by providing additional 
genomic insights, but it is not clear what outcomes are generate by such insights and further study is needed to get beyond 
the clinical validity of this testing.
201
 
In summary, the Afirma Xpression Atlas test enhances the molecular characterization of indeterminate thyroid nodules, 
although its PPV is similar to that of the GSC alone and the clinical utility of its use has yet to be determined. 
The ATA 2015 guidelines regarding evaluation and management of ITNs addressed the role of using molecular classifiers and 
biomarkers.
193
 The guidelines indicated that an ideal ‘‘rule-in’’ test would have a positive predictive value (PPV) for 
histopathologically proven malignancy similar to a malignant cytologic diagnosis (98.6%), and an ideal ‘‘rule-out’’ test would 

Somatic Tumor Testing 
© 2025 Carelon Medical Benefits Management. All rights reserved. 30 
have a negative-predictive value similar to a benign cytologic diagnosis (96.3%). These guidelines commented on the 
limitations in the current literature, including lack of blinding of pathologists and clinicians, lack of controlled studies and direct 
comparisons of different evaluation methods, concerns about the reproducibility of findings across populations
204
, lack of 
clarity about how test results change surgical management, and lack of long-term outcome data. Overall, these ATA guidelines 
were praised by community oncologists and European specialists for more strongly emphasizing nodule and tumor 
morphology and topography and for showing less enthusiasm for molecular biomarkers for risk stratification (compared to their 
prior guideline), emphasizing the relative importance of clear, comprehensive ultrasonographic and pathology reports.
205
 
Molecular testing is thus viewed as an adjunct that may facilitate decision-making in selected patients. The ATA guideline 
rationales are that no single molecular test or combination of tests yet has proved useful in terms of clinical utility across all 
indeterminate cases and that molecular testing continues to evolve.
206
 A 2023 clinical practice guideline from the European 
Thyroid Association offers a comprehensive overview of the standard of care in management of thyroid nodules, and affirms 
the role of molecular testing in Bethesda III and IV nodules.
207
 Similarly, the risk-based approach for managing indeterminate 
nodules and the clinical utility specifically associated with molecular testing of Bethesda III/IV nodules is highlighted in a 
clinical review in Lancet by Chen and colleagues.
208
 Various contemporary studies, including a large, blinded, multicenter 
study of Thyroseq v3 showed that the testing did not meet the ATA threshold for a “rule-in” test due to the low PPV and its 
potential value as a rule-out test varied by cancer prevalence but was sufficiently high (NPV 97%) when that prevalence was 
28%.
209
 A systematic review and meta-analysis of published gene expression classifier studies in this realm observed that the 
published validation cohorts were not representative of the populations in whom these tests have been used, particularly 
because of differences in the underlying prevalence rates of cancer which affect the negative predictive value of the test.
210
  
Overall, several molecular classifiers have demonstrated analytical and clinical validity in the evaluation of ITNs, although the 
supporting studies should be interpreted in light of high levels of diagnostic review bias, verification bias, and study design 
limitations.
199
 Some molecular testing approaches involve bundling a molecular classifier with other somatic testing to identify 
expressed molecular variants and fusions.
211
 Such bundled testing approaches have not been established to have clinical 
utility as the entire platform and its use requires evaluation of the net clinical benefit. For any biomarker test to have clinical 
utility, it must also be shown to improve outcomes compared with if the biomarker test results are not known.
212
 The 
prevalence of thyroid cancer in these nodules varies considerably between studies and between sites in the multicenter 
studies.
210, 213
 Thus, to apply these molecular test results in patient management, clinicians must know the prevalence of 
cancer in their own patient population where the test would be applied. Furthermore, clinicians must be careful in deciding 
when to use the test, because for patients with an indication for surgery based on cytology alone or based on the size of the 
nodule 
214, 215
 or the risk of malignancy based on the sonographic pattern 
216
, or contraindication for surgery based on various 
reasons, there is little value in pursuing this type of testing.
213
  
There is special interest in ITNs with Hürthle cells. Hürthle cells are thyroid follicular-derived epithelial cells with oncocytic 
cytology, and accurately classifying nodules with these cells is difficult with fine-needle aspiration. There has been interest in 
the use of third generation molecular classifiers for this subset of ITNs. Although patients with advanced oncocyte carcinoma 
of the thyroid (previously known as Hürthle cell carcinoma) have a poor prognosis, patients presenting with minimally invasive, 
early disease have an excellent prognosis.
217
 The majority of these lesions have low-risk or no molecular alterations and are 
benign on follow-up. Unfortunately, no single molecular alteration defines cytologically indeterminate Hürthle cell lesions; and 
molecular testing is not definitive in determining which cases may be managed conservatively.
218
 There are ongoing efforts to 
improve classification of these nodules
219
, but thus far the accuracy of these molecular classifier tests falls short of providing 
clinical utility to guide surgical management.  
Unresectable, advanced, and anaplastic thyroid cancer 
NTRK gene fusions are reported in about 1.9% of patients with thyroid carcinoma. However, treatment of patients with this 
molecular aberration using TRK inhibitors (larotrectinib or entrectinib) shows promising results, with response rates of 60-70%. 
In addition to the importance of NTRK testing for locally advanced disease, an expert panel suggests that testing in patients 
with unresectable disease also has a role in guiding management.
220
 
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for thyroid carcinoma support molecular testing for 
anaplastic thyroid cancer regardless of stage, because of the very high risk of rapidly progressive disease for this histology.
221
 
Unknown Primary Site Cancer 
Gene expression profiling and somatic genetic testing for individuals to predict the site of tumor origin (i.e., non-
agnostic tissue testing) of cancer of unknown primary are considered not medically necessary.  
For multianalyte assays used for prognostication (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the Carelon 
Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing.  
Note: Tumor agnostic genetic testing indications may also apply, depending on the clinical scenario (e.g., there 
are no satisfactory tumor-specific standard therapies available, there are no indications for planned therapy that

would apply independent of the results of genetic testing [such as immune checkpoint inhibitor indications], and 
progression of disease). See the Tissue Agnostic Testing guideline for details.  
Rationale 
Cancer of unknown primary site (CUP) refers to a diverse set of malignancies where the tissue of origin remains unclear the 
standard set of detailed investigations (clinic, laboratory, pathology, and imaging) have been completed. These may also be 
called occult primary cancers. With the advent of modern imaging and immunohistochemistry diagnostic techniques, the 
incidence of CUP has decreased from around 3%–5% in the 1990s to 1%–2% in the current era.
222
 CUP is categorized into 
four histological types that include adenocarcinoma of good-to-moderate differentiation (50%), followed by poorly 
undifferentiated adenocarcinomas (30%), squamous cell carcinoma (15%) and undifferentiated neoplasms (5%).
223
 In most 
patients, the disease is disseminated and incurable. The majority of patients present with visceral disease, mainly to liver and 
lungs. CUP was once treated as a distinct cancer and investigated with phase 2 treatment trials response rates of 25% to 35% 
and survival ranging from 6 to 16 months. Survival has been longer for patients with nodal, pleural, or serous peritoneal 
disease (14 to 16 months) than for patients with visceral metastatic disease (6 to 9 months).
224
 Less common, presentations 
such as bone predominant CUP (with median survival around 15 months) or lymph node-only CUP (median survival over 30 
months) drive unique approaches in terms of their risk stratification and treatment.
225
 In a broad phase II trial using 
pembrolizumab to treat rare cancers, 22 patients with CUP were enrolled with no complete responses, 3 partial responses, 
and 4 patients with stable disease.
226
  
Various tissue of origin (TOO) classifiers have been developed TOO classifiers have been developed on data from a wide 
range of molecular methods including targeted DNA sequencing, whole exome and whole genome DNA sequencing, RNA 
profiling, and methylation profiling.
227
 Several whole genome sequencing (WGS) based have been developed and are able to 
discriminate between 18 and 35 cancer types but with different performance across sub-cohorts of common cancer types 
(such as breast and colorectal cancer) compared to various other types of uncommon cancers.
227-229
 There is also some 
variation based on TOO classifiers that are testing untreated versus treated metastatic cancers.
227
 Unfortunately, advances in 
diagnostics have not yielded clinical utility as yet through translation into a survival benefit, as no differences in outcome were 
reported between empirical and molecularly guided treatments.
223
 The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
recommendations for cancers of unknown primary site focus on immunohistochemical (IHC) testing and not on genomic 
profiling.
230
 The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) makes no recommendation for the use of gene expression 
profiling-based site-directed therapy (i.e., tissue of origin prediction).
231, 232
 Meanwhile, user-friendly nomograms using readily 
available clinicopathological factors (not based on molecular testing) can provide robust personalized prognostication and aid 
in decision-making and selection or stratification of patients for clinical trial enrollment.
233
 A prospective trial of 158 patients 
conducted at a single academic institution evaluated the feasibility and value of genomic profiling in cancer of unknown 
primary site and found that 4/158 (2.5%) of patients had the genomic profiling trigger a change in treatment recommendation 
and implementation.
234
 Among these 4 patients, it is unclear whether such changes in treatment would be associated with net 
clinical benefit. Likewise, a retrospective study of 578 tumor patient samples from individuals found that the most common 
molecular aberrations were KRAS (35%), CDKN2A (15%), TP53 (15%), and ERBB2 (12%).
235
 Overall, the feasibility of 
molecular profiling in this setting is not in doubt, the challenge is establishing the clinical utility of routine, initial molecular 
testing compared to standard of care approaches in CUP that include genomic profiling for selected patients after initial 
evaluation based on current, standard criteria for tumor agnostic testing.

Somatic Testing of Hematologic Malignancies 
Clinical Indications 
General Requirements  
Repeated testing of the same individual for the same indication should be limited to evaluation following an 
intervention, or when there is a change in clinical status such that additional testing is required to determine next 
steps in management. At times, it may be necessary to repeat a test using different techniques or protocols to 
clarify a finding or result of the original study. 
Repeated testing for the same indication using the same or similar technology may be subject to additional review 
or require peer-to-peer conversation in the following scenarios:  
• Repeated diagnostic testing of the same tumor site with no clinical change, treatment, or intervention 
since the previous study 
• Repeated diagnostic testing of the same individual and the same tumor by different providers over a 
short period of time 
Umbrella Criteria 
Somatic Genomic Testing (Tumor Biomarker Testing)  
Somatic genomic testing is considered medically necessary in individuals with cancer when ALL of the following 
criteria are met: 
• The genomic testing has established analytical and clinical validity (i.e., FDA-approved test, when 
available) and is performed in an appropriately certified laboratory 
• The genetic test has established clinical utility such that a positive or negative result will meaningfully 
impact the clinical management (predictive, diagnostic, prognostic, or therapeutic) of the individual and 
will likely result in improvement in net health outcomes (i.e., the health benefits of the interventions 
outweigh any medical or psychological harmful effects of the testing intervention) 
o When there are genomic biomarker-linked therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) for the individual’s specific cancer scenario and such therapies are being 
considered in the near term 
o When considering a treatment for which there are specific genomic biomarker-based 
contraindications or exclusions related therapeutic decisions being considered in the near term 
• Clinical decision making incorporates the known or predicted impact of a specific genomic alteration on 
protein expression or function and published clinical data on the efficacy of targeting that genomic 
alteration with a particular agent 
Rationale 
Nearly every malignancy will have somatic mutations that have been described, although most known mutations do not have 
clinical management implications. While various common conditions are covered by specific guideline criteria for somatic 
testing of tumors, it is not feasible to establish criteria for every clinical scenario in oncology and hematology. The general 
criteria for somatic testing (above) apply to malignancy when more specific criteria may or may not be available.

Cancer-specific Criteria 
Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia 
Tissue- (OR bone marrow-) based (OR alternatively, peripheral blood if morphologically detectable circulating 
blasts) somatic genetic testing (50 or fewer genes) is considered medically necessary for children or adults with 
acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• Testing is for the purpose of establishing the diagnosis, to stratify risk, or to identify actionable 
therapeutic targets 
• A multi-gene panel contains genes that are identified with B-ALL or T-ALL, such as ABL1, ABL2, 
CRLF2, CSF1R, FLT3, FGFR, NTRK, LYN, PTK2Br, IL7R, JAK1, JAK2, JAK3, ETV6, RUNX1, TCF3, 
TCF4, PBX1, DUX4, PAX5, KMT2A, HLF, ZNF384, MEF2D, ZNF384, MYC, PDGFRB, SH2B3, TP53, 
IKZF1, NUTM1, MEF2D, ZNF384, RAS, PTEN, NOTCH1, and FBXW7 
Chromosomal analyses of bone marrow specimens (or alternatively, peripheral blood if morphologically 
detectable circulating blasts), which may also include FISH testing, to detect and characterize clonal 
chromosomal abnormalities that have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications are 
considered medically necessary for children and adults with ALL. 
The use of NGS testing on bone marrow specimen is considered medically necessary in children or adults with 
ALL to measure minimal residual disease (MRD) at the end of initial treatment induction and end of initial 
consolidation and at similar defined points over the course of sequential therapies. 
BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutation analysis is considered medically necessary in the evaluation of 
individuals with BCR-ABL (Philadelphia chromosome) positive ALL to evaluate treated individuals who manifest 
suboptimal response to initial tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy or loss of response to tyrosine kinase inhibitor 
therapy. 
PCR testing for BCR-ABL1 quantification on bone marrow specimen is considered medically necessary in the 
monitoring of Philadelphia chromosome-positive ALL. 
Rationale 
Acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) has a bimodal age distribution, the first peak occurring at approximately 5 years of age 
and the second at approximately 50 years. ALL may be of B-cell precursor or T-cell lineage. In the United States, ALL is the 
most common cancer among children and the most frequent cause of death from cancer before 20 years of age.
236
 The cure 
rate of pediatric ALL is at least 80%, in adults closer to 30% to 40%.
237
 Several genetic factors (such as Down’s syndrome) are 
associated with an increased risk of ALL, but most patients have no recognized inherited factors.  
On average, childhood ALL genomes contain 10 to 20 non-silent coding mutations at the time of diagnosis and about twice as 
many at the time of relapse. Many mutations the transcriptional regulation of lymphoid development and differentiation; cell-
cycle regulation; the TP53–retinoblastoma protein tumor-suppressor pathway; growth factor receptor, Ras, 
phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase, and JAK-STAT signaling; nucleoside metabolism; and epigenetic modification.
236
 Adult patients 
have been found to have more gene mutations, especially IKZF1, MLL2, and JAK3, but fewer alterations of PTPN11 
compared with pediatric patients.
238
 The precise contribution of these genetic or epigenetic abnormalities to leukemogenesis, 
the development of drug resistance and leukemic clone evolution remains to be defined.
238
  
Quantification of measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) detected by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow 
cytometry, or next generation sequencing (NGS). The risk of ALL treatment failure and death is 3 to 5 times as high among 
children with levels of minimal residual disease that are 0.01% or higher at the end of induction therapy and at later time points 
than among those with levels that are lower than 0.01%.
236
 Overall, MRD testing has prognostic implications in various 
subsets of both pediatric and adult ALL across therapies, methods of and times of MRD assessment, cutoff levels, and 
disease subtypes based on a meta-analysis of 39 publications comprising over 13,000 patients.
239
 There are caveats with this 
testing. Although MRD is a direct measure of disease burden and treatment response in ALL, there may be sanctuary sites in 
the body that contribute to relapse but are not measurable by conventional methods. Also, technical difficulties can give 
misleading results, and standardized methods for MRD determination are not widely available outside of specialized 
centers.
239
 A randomized clinical trial of intensification of therapy for patients with higher levels of minimal residual disease has 
been conducted showing non-significant improvement in survival but demonstrating the promise of this method of patient 
selection for clinical trials.
240
 MRD monitoring has become integral to clinical trials developed by the St. Jude Consortium, the 
Children’s Oncology Group, and the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute ALL Consortium, and has also been recognized as an 

Somatic Tumor Testing

essential component of patient evaluation over the course of sequential therapy in consensus-based guidelines.
241
 Several 
more recent studies also confirm the role of MRD testing in B-cell precursor ALL
242
, in young adult T-cell ALL
243
, and in mixed 
cohorts of ALL patients treated on investigational protocols.
244
 Regarding the timing of MRD monitoring, Carelon guidelines 
are in concordance with the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline recommendations.
245
  
Acute Myelogenous Leukemia 
Tissue-based (OR alternatively, peripheral blood if morphologically detectable circulating blasts) somatic genetic 
testing (50 or fewer genes) is considered medically necessary for individuals with acute myelogenous leukemia 
(AML) when BOTH of the following criteria are met: 
• Testing is for the purpose of establishing the diagnosis, to stratify risk, or to identify actionable 
therapeutic targets 
• A multi-gene panel contains genes that are identified with AML, such as FLT3, IDH1, IDH2, NPM1, CBFB, 
MYH1, CEBPA, MLLT3, KMT2A, DEK, NUP214, KAT6A, CREBBP, GATA2, EVI1, DDX41, TP53, 
ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, U2AF1, and ZRSR2 
Chromosomal analyses of preferred bone marrow specimens, which may also include FISH testing, to detect and 
characterize clonal chromosomal abnormalities that have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
implications are considered medically necessary for individuals with AML.  
The use of multi-gene panel NGS testing on peripheral blood or bone marrow specimens is considered not 
medically necessary in members with AML to measure minimal residual disease (MRD).  
The use of focused testing of peripheral blood or bone marrow using RT-qPCR is considered medically 
necessary to measure minimal residual disease (MRD) in acute promyelocytic leukemia, or NPM1 or core 
binding factor AML when used at appropriate defined points over the course of therapy such as at the end of 
initial treatment induction, at the end of initial consolidation, or at the completion of other sequential therapies.  
Rationale 
Acute myelogenous leukemia (AML) is a disease characterized by infiltration of the bone marrow, blood, and other tissues by 
proliferative, clonal, abnormally differentiated hematopoietic cells. Most cases of AML are characterized by clonal 
heterogeneity at the time of diagnosis. Leukemic relapse invariably arises from a pre-existing—or at least a closely genetically-
related—clone.
246
 Various patterns of dynamic clonal evolution that occur at relapse probably contribute to resistance to 
therapy.
247
 Adults under age 60 years are cured with intensive leukemia treatment around 40% of the time.
247
 However, this is 
generally a disease of older adults with a median age at diagnosis of 68 years and escalating incidence with increasing age, 
with older adults having a much worse prognosis and cure rate closer to 10%.
248
  
The World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours 5th edition was updated in 2022 wherein the classification of 
AML emphasizes recent breakthroughs in how this disease is understood and managed. Foremost is the separation of AML 
with defining genetic abnormalities from AML defined by differentiation.
249
 The defining genetic abnormalities include the 
following:  fusions of PML::RARA, RUNX1::RUNX1T1CBFB::MYH11, DEK::NUP214, RBM15::MRTFA, and BCR:ABL1, 
rearrangements of KMT2A, MECOM, NUP98, NPM1, or CEBPA, and mutations of NPM1 or CEBPA. Genomic evaluation of 
patients with AML has been demonstrated to have a higher diagnostic yield compared to conventional cytogenetic analysis.
250
  
The most widely used consensus risk stratification guidelines in AML are those from the European LeukemiaNet (ELN), an 
international working group of several dozen AML experts. The 2022 ELN recommendations are for screening for the following 
specific gene mutations required for establishing the diagnosis and to identify actionable therapeutic targets: FLT3, IDH1, 
IDH2, NPM1 CEBPA,DDX41, TP53; ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, U2AF1, ZRSR2.
251
 The ELN 
acknowledges that additional genes are investigational in this rapidly evolving field and are not currently required for 
establishing the diagnosis or for the identification of actionable therapeutic targets. Leukemia experts have advocated for the 
principle that risk groups are dynamic as newer therapies emerge for specific disease subsets and updated approaches may 
be recognized and widely adopted by nationally and internationally.
252
  
Measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) can be detected by polymerase chain reaction (PCR), flow cytometry, or next 
generation sequencing (NGS). MRD testing has prognostic implications in various subsets of AML and at various times 
throughout treatment.
253, 254
 This testing may define molecular persistence after intensive chemotherapy, molecular 
progression or relapse after intensive chemotherapy, or molecular relapse, progression, or persistence post stem cell 
transplantation.
255
 Testing is often pursued to assess eligibility in MRD-directed clinical trials. The proven therapeutic 
implications of MRD remain mostly unresolved.
246, 251
 Recent expert reviews emphasize that multiparametric flow cytometry is 
the gold standard for serial monitoring of patients with AML, but there are certain subsets of AML (acute promyelocytic

leukemia, or NPM1 or core-binding-factor associated AML are exceptions that can be monitored with focused NGS testing, 
and the poor prognosis and limited treatment options for relapsed, refractory AML have stimulated the emerging literature that 
relates to MRD testing to drive specific therapeutic approaches.
256, 257
 
Chronic Myeloid Leukemia 
Bone marrow tissue-based OR peripheral blood somatic genetic testing (i.e., 50 or less genes) is considered 
medically necessary for establishing the diagnosis of suspected chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) when the 
following criterion is met: 
• PCR or FISH testing includes the evaluation of the BCR-ABL1 fusion gene  
BCR-ABL kinase domain point mutation analysis is considered medically necessary in the monitoring of CML in 
the following circumstance: 
• Evaluation of individuals with CML to evaluate treated individuals who manifest suboptimal response to 
tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy indicated by ANY of the following: 
o Lack of a partial hematologic or cytogenetic response at 3 months or greater after treatment 
onset 
o Less than a complete hematologic and cytogenetic response at 12 months 
o Disease progression to accelerated or blast phase 
Chromosomal analyses of bone marrow specimens to detect and characterize clonal chromosomal abnormalities 
that have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications are considered medically necessary for 
individuals with CML.  
PCR testing for BCR-ABL1 quantification is considered medically necessary for response assessment every 3 
months during active treatment with tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy. 
PCR testing for BCR-ABL1 quantification is considered medically necessary for monitoring patients who have 
undergone discontinuation of tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy with assessment not more frequent than the 
following schedule: monthly for the first 6 months after discontinuation, bimonthly for months 7 to 12, and every 3 
months thereafter. 
Myeloproliferative Neoplasms  
Bone marrow tissue-based OR peripheral blood somatic genetic testing (50 or fewer genes) is considered 
medically necessary for initial evaluation of suspected myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN) (e.g., essential 
thrombocytosis, polycythemia vera, chronic neutrophilic leukemia, and primary myelofibrosis) when BOTH of the 
following criteria are met: 
• PCR, FISH, or NGS testing is targeting applicable JAK2, CALR, CSF3R, and MPL genes for diagnostic 
workup and (if applicable) a focused set of additional genes for initial risk stratification in the event that a 
specific myeloproliferative neoplasm is diagnosed 
• ONE of the following clinical scenarios (for MPNs other than primary or secondary myelofibrosis): 
o Hemoglobin ≥16.5 g/dL in male and hemoglobin ≥16.0 g/dL in female 
o Hematocrit greater than 49% in male and hematocrit greater than 48% in female 
o Platelet count ≥450 X 10
9
/L 
o Leukocytosis (white blood cell) ≥11 X 10
9
/L 
Rationale 
Elevated peripheral blood cell counts, such as leukocytosis, thrombocytosis, and polycythemia, are often the presenting 
symptom in patients with myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPN), and their thresholds are further defined by the World Health 
Organization. These diseases include chronic myeloid leukemia (CML), polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocytosis 
(ET), primary myelofibrosis (PM), chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL), and several other less common subtypes.
249
 PMNs are

characterized by the abnormal proliferation of mature bone marrow cell lineages and a clinical course that is usually 
prolonged, but ultimately leads to marrow fibrosis and acute leukemia. These are hematopoietic stem-cell disorders that share 
mutations that constitutively activate the physiologic signal-transduction pathways responsible for hematopoiesis.
258
 Likewise, 
CML is a disease of hematopoietic stem cells arising from a translocation t(9;22)(q34;q11) with the shortened chromosome 22. 
The translocation leads to a juxtaposition of the ABL1 gene from chromosome 9 and the BCR gene from chromosome 22, 
resulting in a BCR-ABL1 fusion gene that codes for BCR-ABL1 transcripts and fusion proteins with high tyrosine kinase 
activity.
259
 Like MPN, patients with CML typically present with elevated peripheral blood counts, particularly excessive 
granulocytes and a left shift of granulopoiesis, and common signs and symptoms include fatigue, weight loss and 
splenomegaly.  
Patients with signs and symptoms consistent with CML or MPN are typically evaluated with review of the peripheral blood 
smear review and BCR-ABL1 analysis undertaken for consideration of CML. In the absence of BCR-ABL1 translocation and 
lack of dysplasia, molecular characterization of JAK2, CALR, CSF3R, and MPL are pursued as well as bone marrow 
morphologic review for an accurate diagnosis.
260
 A positive finding for a mutation established the presence of a hematopoietic 
stem cell disorder and rules out myelodysplasia, but none of these mutations are disease-defining.
258
 Distinction between the 
MPN types is based on integrating peripheral blood findings with molecular data and bone marrow morphologic evaluation 
findings, as none of these parameters alone provide sufficient diagnostic specificity.
249
 Several other somatic mutations have 
been reported in persons with JAK2, MPL or CALR mutations including epigenetic modifiers (ASXL1, TET2, EZH2, IDH1, 
IDH2, DNMT3A), RNA splicing factors (SRSF2, U2AF1, SF3B1) and transcriptional regulators (TP53, IKZF1, NF-E2, CUX1). 
These mutations do not cause myeloproliferation.
261
 The cytogenetic landscape of MPNs is limited and does not differ 
substantially according to the type of neoplasm. Moreover, driver mutation status is not associated with the time to leukemic 
transformation or survival after transformation.
258
 While identification of additional somatic mutations has been incorporated 
into some prognostic scoring tools 
262, 263
, more research is needed to establish the clinical utility of expanded prognostic 
testing along with other clinical considerations to guide patient management.
264
 
For CML specifically, the diagnosis must be confirmed by cytogenetics showing t(9;22)(q34;q11) and by multiplex RT-PCR 
showing BCR-ABL1 transcripts. At baseline, neither quantitative RT-PCR measuring BCR-ABL1 transcripts level nor BCR-
ABL1 mutation analysis are advised at baseline since these data are not necessary for decision-making.
259
 Tyrosine kinase 
inhibitor therapy (such as imatinib and other agents) and careful disease monitoring has reduced the incidence of progression 
to advanced phase and the 10-year overall survival rate for CML is now 80%-90%.
265
 A principal goal of CML therapy with 
TKIs is the achievement of a stable molecular remission which accords successful discontinuation of therapy, a concept now 
known as ‘treatment-free remission.
261
 Monitoring of treatment is now almost exclusively done molecularly by quantitative PCR 
measurement of BCR-ABL1 transcripts according to the International Scale with optimal response, warning category, and 
treatment failure defined.
266
 BCR-ABL1 ≤1% has been determined to be equivalent to complete cytogenetic remission; greater 
than 10% BCR-ABL1 at 3 months indicates treatment failure when confirmed. Response milestones are the same for first and 
second-line therapy and include measurements at baseline and every 3 months thereafter with more intense monitoring (every 
4-6 weeks) for the first year after treatment discontinuation.
259
 Achieving specific time-dependent molecular milestones, as 
defined by global therapeutic guidelines, has been established as critical in maximizing optimal outcomes while identifying 
patients at risk of therapy failure.
267
  
More than 100 different kinase domain mutations of BCR-ABL1 that impair TKI binding have been reported in patients who 
develop TKI resistance.
265
 Resistance to imatinib occurs in 10%–15%, and to second generation TKIs in <10% of patients in 
first-line treatment. Mutations account for resistance in about one-third of resistant patients in chronic phase, and in about two-
thirds of resistant patients in accelerated or blast phase.
268
 A prospective multicenter study has demonstrated that NGS 
provides a more accurate picture of BCR-ABL1 mutation status compared to standard Sanger sequencing and demonstrated 
the clinical relevance of low level mutations
269
, thus NGS is the recommended technology for detecting BCR-ABL1 resistance 
mutations in patients not adequately responding to TKI therapy.
268
  
Myelodysplastic Syndrome 
Somatic testing (i.e., 50 or fewer genes) of bone marrow tissue OR peripheral blood is considered medically 
necessary for individuals with clinically diagnosed or suspected myelodysplastic syndrome when BOTH of the 
following criteria are met: 
• Testing is for the purpose of establishing the diagnosis, to stratify risk, or to identify actionable 
therapeutic targets 
• A multi-gene panel contains genes that are identified with MDS, such as ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, 
NRAS, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, ZRSR2, and UBA1 

Somatic Tumor Testing

Chromosomal analyses of preferred bone marrow specimens to detect and characterize clonal chromosomal 
abnormalities that have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications are considered medically 
necessary for individuals with myelodysplastic syndrome. 
Rationale 
Myelodyplastic syndromes (MDS) are clonal hematopoietic neoplasms defined by cytopenias and morphologic dysplasia. MDS 
occurs mainly, but not exclusively in older adults, with the median age being 70 years. MDS evolves to AML through a process 
of clonal selection, with the pattern of transformation occurring in different patterns depending on the subtype and mutation 
drivers.
270
 In subtypes of MDS at lower risk of transformation, treatment is focused mainly on improving anemia and other 
cytopenias. In higher risk disease, the focus is more on delaying disease progression and prolonging survival. Allogeneic stem 
cell transplantation is the only potentially curative therapy, but it is rarely applicable since most patients are older adults.
271
 The 
World Health Organization (WHO) Classification of Tumours 5th edition was updated in 2022 wherein the classification of 
MDS now features genetically defined disease types rather than risk-based grouping based on features such as blast 
percentage, ring sideroblasts, and number of lineages with dysplasia.
249
 Somatic mutations with an overall incidence of 5% or 
greater in MDS include ASXL1, DNMT3A, EZH2, NRAS, RUNX1, SF3B1, SRSF2, STAG2, TET2, TP53, U2AF1, and 
ZRSR2.
272
  
Vacuoles, E1 enzyme, X-linked, autoinflammatory, somatic (VEXAS) syndrome is caused by somatic mutations in UBA1. 
VEXAS-associated myelodysplastic syndrome is a distinct entity from classical MDS, both in presentation and clinical course, 
highlighting the role of UBA1 testing.
273
  
To meet the challenge of the heterogeneity in clinical course and outcomes for MDS, the International Prognostic Scoring 
System–Revised (IPSS-R), was developed by the International Working Group for Prognosis in MDS and set the course for 
risk stratification, clinical trial design, and treatment recommendations.
274
 More recently, a clinical-molecular prognostic model 
(IPSS-Molecular [IPSS-M]) has been validated.
275, 276
 In multivariable analysis, the top genetic mutations found to be 
predictors of adverse outcomes were identified in TP53, FLT3, and KMT2A (MLL), while SF3B1 mutations were associated 
with favorable outcomes. Moreover, mutations in ASXL1, BCOR, EZH2, NRAS, RUNX1, STAG2, and U2AF1 were 
significantly associated with adverse risk for several key outcomes as well. The IPSS-M model has also been explored to 
improve MDS prognostication for selection of candidates for hematopoietic stem cell transplantation.
277
 
Multiple Myeloma  
Gene expression profile tests  
Gene expression profile tests for diagnostic evaluation, risk stratification, or management of multiple myeloma are 
considered not medically necessary. 
For multianalyte assays used for prognostication (often combined with algorithmic analyses), see the Carelon 
Guidelines for Predictive and Prognostic Polygenic Testing.  
 
Chromosomal analyses of bone marrow specimens 
Chromosomal analyses of bone marrow specimens to detect and characterize clonal chromosomal abnormalities 
that have important diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic implications are considered medically necessary for 
individuals with multiple myeloma. 
The use of NGS testing of tumor DNA from bone marrow specimens to detect or quantify minimal residual 
disease (MRD) in individuals with myeloma is considered medically necessary under EITHER of the following 
circumstances: 
• MRD testing used prior to initiating new treatment intended to induce myeloma remission 
• MRD testing used to assess depth of response after a cycle of treatment intended to induce myeloma 
remission 
Rationale 
Multiple myeloma is the second most common hematological malignancy, accounting for about 2% of cancer deaths in the 
United States. Almost all patients with multiple myeloma evolve from an asymptomatic pre-malignant stage termed monoclonal 
gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), and the rate of progression is influenced by the underlying cytogenetic

findings.
278
 The diagnosis requires the presence of clonal plasma cells in the bone marrow or in a biopsy-proven bone or 
extramedullary plasmacytoma. The majority of patients with myeloma present with symptoms related to organ involvement 
(hypercalcemia, renal insufficiency, anemia, and bone lesions). Less commonly, patients may be diagnosed based on 
abnormal blood or urine tests.
279
  
Multiple myeloma is increasingly recognized as more than one disease, characterized by marked cytogenetic, molecular, and 
proliferative heterogeneity. Risk stratification is important for prognostication, patient selection for clinical trials, and 
comparison of treatment approaches. Risk stratification is complex and involves cytogenetic classification combined with 
disease stage, host factors, and other prognostic factors.
278
 The revised ISS(R-ISS) was introduced in 2015 and has been 
widely validated.
280
 More recently, additional cytogenetic abnormalities have been found and newer, validated models are 
available such as the Mayo Additive Staging System
281
 and evolving tools such as the Mayo Clinic mSMART risk stratification 
method (www.msmart.org).

Given the high rates of complete response seen in patients with multiple myeloma with new treatment approaches, new 
response categories have emerged that focus on detection of residual tumor cells in the bone marrow using modern flow 
cytometry or next-generation sequencing (NGS) techniques. The clinical utility of peripheral blood-based evaluation of minimal 
residual disease remains unknown.
282
 For circulating cell-free DNA testing, the data show that this approach lacks sensitivity 
compared to bone marrow assessment for measurable/minimal residual disease (MRD) evaluation.
283
 Testing for circulating 
tumor cells in the peripheral blood is also being explored, but the establishment of appropriate cut-off levels associated with 
clinical utility is not yet clear.
284, 285
 Bone marrow testing is the evidence-based standard for MRD testing, with MRD negativity 
defined as the absence of tumor plasma cells within 1,000,000 bone marrow cells, a threshold that indicates the best results 
for the prediction of both progression-free and overall survival.
286
 Detailed aspects of this approach to detecting MRD were 
outlined in 2016 by the International Myeloma Working Group (IMWG)
282
, and guidelines from the American Society and 
Cancer Care Ontario
279
 and from the European Society of Medical Oncology and the European Hematology Association
286
 
have since endorsed routine use of MRD testing for response assessment. The ASCO guideline makes a strong 
recommendation that the quality and depth of response should be assessed by IMWG criteria, with the recommendation 
based on high-quality evidence. MRD is recommended to test the depth of response after each cycle of therapy intended to 
induce remission. The use of MRD to assess disease status during maintenance therapy is being explored but is not yet 
established.
287
 For example, it is unclear whether maintenance therapy in MRD-negative patients can be stopped or whether 
treatment needs to be changed in MRD-positive patients.
286
 ASCO considers the evidence strength low and recommendation 
weak for MRD testing during maintenance therapy, and makes a moderate strength recommendation not to modify 
maintenance therapy based on depth of response information.
