Policy Guidelines</h2>\r\n<p>The science of noninvasive disease monitoring has advanced greatly since circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) was first reported in body fluids by Mandel and Metais. Since then, the evolution of sensitive cfDNA detection technologies has enabled the development of liquid biopsies with many clinical applications. For example, in oncology, the use of liquid biopsy allows for patient stratification (companion diagnostics), screening, monitoring treatment response and detection of minimal residual disease after surgery/recurrence. Liquid biopsies have grown in importance because, the genetic profile of tumors can affect how well they respond to a certain treatment. However, this characterization is currently achieved through a biopsy despite the inherent problems in procurement of tissue samples and the limitations of tumor analyses. For example, the invasive nature of a biopsy poses a risk to patients and can have a significant cost.</p>\r\n<p>Tumor sampling from some cancer types also remains difficult resulting in inadequate amount of tissue for genetic testing. In the case of advanced or metastatic non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC) as many as 69% of cases do not have accessible tissue. Even when tissue can be collected, preservation methods such as formalin fixation can cause false positive for results for genetic tests. Finally, due to tumor heterogeneity, biopsies often suffer from sample bias.&nbsp; Liquid biopsies are becoming more popular as they provide an opportunity to genotype in a less invasive and expensive manner. However, the low sensitivity (between 60-80%) and higher number of false negative cases compared to traditional tissue biopsy are limitations associated with liquid biopsies.</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Approaches to Liquid Biopsy Analysis</span></h3>\r\n<h4><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Circulating tumor cells (CTCs)</span></h4>\r\n<p>According to Brock et al. (2015), CTCs are cells shed into the vasculature from a primary tumor and may constitute seeds for subsequent growth of additional tumors (metastasis) in distant organs. CTCs generally confer the advantage of containing RNA, DNA, and protein from tumor cells including both nuclear and cytoplasmic biomarkers, which is not attainable from&nbsp;ctDNA&nbsp;or exosomes. They have been detected in various metastatic carcinomas for example breast, prostate, lung, and colorectal cancer but are extremely rare in healthy subjects and patients with nonmalignant diseases. Clinical evidence indicates that patients with metastatic lesions are more likely to have CTCs amenable to isolation but their frequency is low, often ~1-10 CTCs per mL of whole blood. As 1 mL of blood contains ~7×10e6 white blood cells and ~5×10e9 red blood cells, technologies capable of reproducibly isolating a single CTC from the background of all other blood components are fundamental. While such levels of sensitivity are challenging, there are several novel developments in this area. These include positive selection, negative selection, physical properties or even enrichment-free assays to efficiently isolate these rare CTCs. However,&nbsp;Bettegowda&nbsp;et al.&nbsp;(2014) stated that an advantage of&nbsp;ctDNA&nbsp;is that it can be analyzed from bio-banked bio-fluids, such as frozen plasma.</p>\r\n<p>Typically, CTCs are defined as cells with an intact viable nucleus, cytokeratin positive, epithelial cell adhesion molecule (EpCAM) positive and with the absence of CD45. Unfortunately EpCAM and other markers are not always expressed on CTCs and are down-regulated by processes such as epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In addition, non-tumor epithelial cells are known to circulate in the blood of patients with prostatitis or patients undergoing surgery. The heterogeneity of CTCs is a major challenge from a technical standpoint. This has led to alternative strategies of CTC enrichment, such as the CTC-iChip which does not rely on tumor antigen expression.</p>\r\n<p>Sequencing the genetic material from CTCs has demonstrated that the majority are not cancer cells, even when the isolated cell(s) fit the phenotypic criteria of being a CTC. One study by Marchetti et al. (2014) developed a protocol to recover the CTC enriched samples from the cartridge of the Veridex platform and found that from 37 NSCLC patients, the EGFR mutation allele abundance ranged between 0.02% and 24.79% with a mean of 6.34%. Brock et al. (2015) concluded that the number of CTCs found in the blood is therefore highly dependent on how the platform defines a cell as a CTC. The CellSearch CTC test, a Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved actionable CTC test, requires that samples are processed within 96 hours of collection after being drawn into the Cellsave preservative tube. This test does not analyze the molecular genetics of the tumor; rather Cellsave is a platform for CTC numeration. A positive test (more than five detected CTCs for metastatic breast and prostate cancer and more than three CTCs for metastatic colorectal cancer per 7.5 mL of blood) is associated with decreased progression-free survival and decreased overall survival in these patients.</p>\r\n<p>Overall, although CTCs have produced some promising results in evaluating prognosis of patients with varying cancers, further studies are needed to assess the clinical utility of these biomarkers.</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Cell free DNA (cfDNA)</span></h4>\r\n<p>There is currently an intensive research effort to understand the utility of cfDNA in various clinical fields such as cancer research, non-invasive prenatal testing and transplant rejection diagnostics. In a systematic review and meta-analysis of 20 studies and 2012 cases covering assessment of EFGR mutational status in NSCLC, Luo et al.(2014) found a sensitivity of 0.674, a specificity of 0.935, and area under the curve of 0.93. The authors concluded that detection of EGFR mutation by cfDNA is of adequate diagnostic accuracy and cfDNA analysis could be a promising screening test for NSCLC.</p>\r\n<p>In a study Jiang et al (2015) observed that most cfDNA in plasma is reportedly fragmented, around 150-180 bp in length with a higher prevalence of tumor associated mutations in the shorter fragments. Per authors, when analyzing the mutation abundance with massively parallel sequencing a significant correlation was found between mutations and fragments less than 150 bp. Notably, the size of the majority of cfDNA fragments overlaps well with the size of histone DNA.</p>\r\n<p>A direct comparison of mutation detection on cfDNA vs. CTCs showed a higher abundance of the mutation on the cfDNA from the same patient; moreover, recent large studies comparing the effectiveness of cfDNA analysis to tissue biopsy in NSCLC showed the clinical value of the liquid biopsy approach (Douillard et al., 2014). This positive result led to an approval to use cfDNA analysis for EGFR mutation analysis for IRESSA in Europe (in patients where a tumor sample was not evaluable), making it the first EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor for which cfDNA testing is included in the label. Although promising, challenges remain when using cfDNA to characterize the mutation status of a tumor. In addition to the low copy number of mutant alleles, the median half-life of cfDNA in circulation ranges from 15 minutes to a few hours.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Brock et al, (2015) in their review observed that the total concentration of cfDNA in the blood of cancer patients varies considerably with tumor specific mutations ranging from undetectable (less than one copy per five mL of plasma) to patients with over a hundred thousand copies of the mutation per mL of plasma. The authors note that “the challenge of how to maximize the yield of the cfDNA and pair this with a platform sensitive enough to detect rare variants in the background of wild-type DNA remains. Optimally, the ability to detect mutations in plasma should not be limited to a subpopulation of patients with very high mutant copy numbers in circulation.” This has been proven to be challenging in early stage cancers.</p>\r\n<p>While many analytical platforms report the mutation load with an allelic frequency compared to the wild-type DNA platforms relying solely on the allelic frequency without recording the number of mutations have limitations. This is because the allelic frequency of a gene is affected by the amount of wild-type DNA not related to the tumor. Therefore, it is important to consider the processes that affect the amount of wild-type DNA in circulation. For example, exercise increases cfDNA levels almost 10-fold. Other pre-analytical variables such as blood collection, the cellular process leading to its release, and extraction protocols affect the amount and size range of cfDNA fragments in a sample.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Exosomes</span></h4>\r\n<p>In the last few years, the exosome field has grown exponentially impacting various areas of research. Studies demonstrating that exosomes are actively released vesicles (carrying RNA, DNA and protein) and can function as inter-cellular messengers, have contributed to their elevated recognition in the scientific community. Yáñez-Mo&nbsp; et al, (2015) in a review outlining the biological properties of exosomes and other extracellular vesicles (EV’s) highlights these developments. However, Gould andRaposo (2013) observed that the exosome field still lags behind as the standardization of extracellular vesicle (EV) types are not yet firmly established. The majority of exosomes range in size from 30-200 nanometer in diameter and are isolated from all bio-fluids, including serum, plasma, saliva, urine and cerebrospinal fluid.</p>\r\n<p>Due to the size of an exosome, on average just over 100 nanometers, the entire transcriptome cannot be packaged inside every vesicle. By way of comparison, retrovirus particles with a similar size can package only around 10 kb, so it is likely that a single vesicle of that size carries only a limited number of transcripts. However, exosomes are extremely abundant (10e11 per mL of plasma) and when isolating the vesicle fraction, most of the transcriptome can be detected. Per Huang et al. (2013), and Kahlert et al. (2014), exosomal RNA can be used for mutation detection as well as global profiling of most types of RNA, and the profile alone (without mutation characterization) can be utilized for diagnostics. In the study ‘Immune modulation of T-cell and NK (natural killer) cell activities by TEXs (tumour-derived exosomes)’ Whiteside (2013) observed that exosome investigations have focused on the important physiologic and pathophysiologic functions of these vesicles in micro-metastasis, angiogenesis and immune modulation and as a means for detection of tumor specific mutations in bio-fluids. Consequently, in 2012, interest in this new field increased when the National Institute of Health (NIH) dedicated the large strategic Common Fund to study these new entities of extracellular RNA. The goal of this effort is to better understand how exosomes can be utilized for biomarkers and therapeutics as well as understanding this new mechanism of intercellular communication.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Mutation detection and RNA profiling</span></h4>\r\n<p>Analysis of nucleic acids present in bodily fluids can provide a better understanding of the disease, as summarized in the Table below.</p>\r\n<p>Comparison of the analysis capability of CTC’s, cfDNA and exosomes from: (Brock et al., 2015)</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-6bdf932609"> Policy Guidelines The science of noninvasive disease monitoring has advanced greatly since circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) was first reported in body fluids by Mandel and Metais.

(Brock et al., 2015) Ribonucleic acid (RNA) profiling from bio-fluids also poses numerous challenges. However, the discovery that exosomes&nbsp; contained RNA made it possible to separate the fragile RNA from the large amounts of RNases and PCR inhibitors that are present in most bio-fluids. As cell-free RNA in blood is immediately degraded, RNAs in serum and plasma are either protected inside vesicles like an exosome, in protein complexes with the Ago2 protein or associated with HDL particles. The levels of these microRNAs are tightly regulated in normal cells and dysregulation has been implicated in several human diseases, e.g., cardiovascular and neurological and is strongly linked to cancer development and progression. However, microRNAs represent only a minor fraction of the transcriptome. By contrast, the nucleic acids in exosomes can be isolated and the entire transcriptome examined.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The most significant hurdle for all forms of liquid biopsy remains the relative rarity of nucleic acid derived from a tumor against the background of normal material found in most patient samples. In fact, the majority of cell, cell-free nucleic acids, microRNAs and exosomes in a liquid biopsy will have originated from normal cells with numbers fluctuating as a consequence of biological variations.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Furthermore, although liquid biopsy was first introduced with serum, other liquid media, such as urine and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), have been used to evaluate other conditions.

An example of this is&nbsp;SelectMDX.&nbsp;SelectMDX&nbsp;evaluates two mRNA cancer-related biomarkers (HOXC6 and DLX1 with&nbsp;KLK3&nbsp;as a reference gene) to assist a clinician in deciding to continue routine screening or to order a prostate biopsy. This test is considered a “non-invasive urine test”&nbsp;(a liquid biopsy)&nbsp;and reports a binary result of “increased risk” or “very low risk.”&nbsp; Van Neste et al.&nbsp;evaluated this test at a 0.90 area under curve in a validation cohort. The authors concluded that the mRNA signature was one of the most significant components of the validation results. Shore et al assessed the effect of&nbsp;SelectMDX&nbsp;results on clinical decision making and found that out of 253 patients&nbsp;SelectMDX&nbsp;evaluated as “negative,” only 12% underwent a biopsy.</p>\r\n<p>Xu et al. (2021) assessed the diagnostic value of urinary exosomes for urological tumors. The authors performed a systematic review and meta-analysis of 16 studies with a total of 3224 patients. Diagnostic value was calculated based on the number of true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives. The sensitivity of using urinary exosomes for the diagnosis of urological tumors was 83% and the specificity was 88%. Sensitivity and specificity results were similar regardless of urinary exosome content type and tumor type. The authors conclude that “urinary exosomes may serve as novel non-invasive biomarkers for urological cancer detection.”</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)</span></h4>\r\n<p>Cerebrospinal Fluid (CSF)&nbsp;is a colorless, clear liquid produced by the choroid plexus.&nbsp;CSF acts to control flow of molecules&nbsp;to&nbsp;the central nervous system&nbsp;(CNS). Due to the tight control of the CSF, it may play a significant role in assessing several conditions. CSF is traditionally used to evaluate conditions such as meningitis, but&nbsp;it&nbsp;has also been used to assess central nervous system cancers, such as&nbsp;leptomeningeal metastases.&nbsp;In addition to widely-known measures of pathology in CSF (opening pressure, total protein, glucose, cell count with differential), circulating tumor cells in CSF have also been proposed as markers for epithelial tumors.</p>\r\n<p>Lin et al.&nbsp;(2017) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of circulating tumor cells in CSF (CSF-CTC) in patients with&nbsp;leptomeningeal metastasis (LM). There were 30 of 95 total patients diagnosed with LM based on a combination of CSF cytology and MRI. CSF-CTCs were detected in 43 patients (median 19.3 CSF-CTC/mL). Based on receiver operating curve analysis, the optimal cutoff was found to be 1 CSF-CTC/mL, identifying patients at a rate of 93% sensitivity, 95% specificity, positive predictive value 90%, and negative predictive value 97%.&nbsp;Diaz et al. (2022) studied the clinical utility of CSF-CTC by evaluating how CSF-CTC quantification was able to predict the outcome of LM. The authors performed a single institution retrospective study of 101 LM patients with solid tumors. The CSF-CTC count significantly predicted survival continuously (p=0.0027). The authors conclude that “CSF-CTCs quantification predicts survival in newly diagnosed LM, and outperforms neuroimaging” and suggest CSF-CTC can be used for LM prognosis and to assess disease burden.</p>\r\n<p>Mathios and Phallen (2022) published a review paper noting “significant strides” towards understanding the molecular mechanisms of brain cancer. Research advances in the field include a focus on the “tumor microenvironment” and identifying molecular biomarkers with liquid-based analyses (such as CSF in liquid biopsy). While it is a rapidly advancing area of research, clinical utility is currently limited, that is, there are currently “no approved noninvasive tests that are clinically useful” for gliomas. The authors point to Cristiano et al. (2019) as an example of a study that analyzed genome-wide cfDNA fragment features (in a variety of cancers); the authors were able to distinguish patients with cancer from non-cancer patients (as well as isolate the tissue of origin). In another glioma-specific study, Mouliere et al. (2018) detected five of 13 patients’ brain tumors (38%) using a cfDNA fragmentation-based approach to analyze cfDNA fragments and copy number alterations in CSF. In conclusion, the authors note that, despite recent excitement over promising studies, liquid biopsy approaches to brain cancer are still “in their infancy.”</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Proprietary Testing</span></h3>\r\n<p>The FDA approval of use of Roche&nbsp;Cobas&nbsp;EGFR&nbsp;Mutation Test in plasma was based&nbsp;on&nbsp;evaluation of plasma samples from the ENSURE study, a multicenter,&nbsp;open-label,&nbsp;randomised, Phase III study of stage IIIB/IV NSCLC patients. A total of 98.6% of the patients enrolled (214/217) had a plasma sample available for testing. The agreement between the&nbsp;cobas&nbsp;EGFR&nbsp;Mutation Test in plasma and tissue was evaluated for detection of&nbsp;EGFR&nbsp;mutations. In 76.7% of tissue-positive specimens, plasma was also positive for an&nbsp;EGFR&nbsp;mutation.&nbsp; Plasma was negative for&nbsp;EGFR&nbsp;mutation in 98.2% (95.4%, 99.3%) of tissue-negative cases. The patients whose plasma results were positive for exon 19 deletion and/or an L858R mutations treated with erlotinib had improved progression-free survival (PFS) compared to those treated with chemotherapy.</p>\r\n<p>Another commercially available, FDA-approved test is&nbsp;Guardant360&nbsp;by Guardant Health Inc. Guardant360 is a gene panel&nbsp;that sequences 74&nbsp;genes&nbsp;(including 18 amplifications and six fusions)&nbsp;associated with NSCLC and reports the percentage of&nbsp;cfDNA. The manufacturer purports that this genetic test will allow providers to make better treatment decisions based on the mutations present in the patient.&nbsp;The gene panel was analytically validated, with 99.8% accuracy on 1000 consecutive samples.</p>\r\n<p>FoundationOne&nbsp;has&nbsp;also created proprietary FDA-approved test that examines cell-free DNA. Foundation One’s liquid CDx test evaluates 324 genes using circulating cell-free DNA and is FDA-approved to report short variants in 311 genes. A prior version of this test (covering 62 genes) was evaluated based on 2666 reference samples. The assay reached >99% sensitivity of short variants of allele frequencies&nbsp;of >0.5%, >95% sensitivity of&nbsp;allele frequencies 0.25%-0.5%, and >70% sensitivity of allele frequencies 0.125%-0.25%. Out of 62 healthy volunteers, no false positives were detected.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Biodesix&nbsp;is another laboratory that offers a liquid biopsy panel. Biodesix offers two tests; one &nbsp;called&nbsp;GeneStrat, tests&nbsp;EGFR,&nbsp;ALK,&nbsp;ROS1,&nbsp;RET,&nbsp;BRAF, and&nbsp;KRAS. Sensitivities of 78%-100% for&nbsp;EGFR,&nbsp;ALK, and&nbsp;KRAS&nbsp;with the GenStrat test were shown in multiple validation studies. GeneStrat also &nbsp;detected over 88% of&nbsp;RET&nbsp;or&nbsp;ROS1-positive patients.&nbsp;&nbsp;Biodesix also offers GeneStrat NGS, a broad 52 gene panel also evaluated through blood-based liquid biopsy technology.</p>\r\n<p>Other firms that offer liquid biopsy testing include&nbsp;ResolutionBio&nbsp;(now part of Agilent) which offers Agilent Resolution ctDx FIRST(“companion diagnostic to KRAZATI™&nbsp;adagrasib) for the detection of KRAS G12C in non-small cell lung cancer [NSCLC]”) and Agilent Resolution ctDx LUNG, which focuses on actionable genes for lung cancer such as EGFR and ALK; Circulogene&nbsp;(tests&nbsp;BRAF, EGFR, KRAS, ALK, ROS1,&nbsp;PD-L1, and MSI),&nbsp;Neogenomics (InvisionFirst, 37-gene panel including 10 actionable genes), and Biocept&nbsp;(CNSide™). As liquid biopsy is a rapidly emerging&nbsp;field,&nbsp;it is possible that many more tests will find their way into the clinical setting.</p>\r\n<p>In addition to panels designed to target cancer or cancer type specific mutations, tests are beginning to emerge that perform the role of a genetic screen in asymptomatic individuals. One such test includes the GRAIL-Galleri multi-cancer early detection (MCED) test, which claims to look for a signal shared by at least 50 types of cancer with a single blood test.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>According to Turnbull C. (2024) the Galleri-MCED test has an overall sensitivity of only 27.5% for early-stage cancer. The test sensitivity improves to 52.8% by restricting analysis to 12 cancers that the Galleri authors specified as being of high unmet need. However, for several of these 12 cancers, including pancreatic, oesophageal, biliary, and liver, the mortality gains from population screening may be low because these cancers are mainly diagnosed in individuals older than 70 years and prognosis is poor regardless of stage.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>Klein et al. (2021) held a Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas substudy including 4077 participants in an independent validation set of Galleri (cancer: n=2823; non-cancer: n=1254, non-cancer status confirmed at year-one follow-up). Specificity for cancer signal detection was 99.5%. Overall sensitivity for cancer signal detection was 51.5% with the sensitivity increasing with stage. Stage I-III sensitivity was 67.6% in the 12 pre-specified cancers and was 40.7% in all cancers. Cancer signals were detected across more than 50 cancer types. Overall accuracy of cancer signal origin prediction in true positives was 88.7%. The study concluded that “The MCED test demonstrated high specificity and accuracy of cancer signal origin prediction and detected cancer signals across a wide diversity of cancers. These results support the feasibility of this blood-based MCED test as a complement to existing single-cancer screening tests.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<h3><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>Clinical Validity and Utility</span></h3>\r\n<p>Seeberg&nbsp;et al.&nbsp;(2015) conducted a prospective study to assess the prognostic and predictive value of CTCs in 194 patients with colorectal liver metastasis referred to surgery.&nbsp;A total of 153 patients underwent a resection (41 patients had an unresectable tumor), and CTCs were detected in 19.6% of patients.&nbsp;Patients with unresectable tumors had a 46% CTC positivity rate compared to 11.7% for&nbsp;resectable&nbsp;tumors.&nbsp;&nbsp;Patients with two or more CTCs experienced reduced time to relapse/progression. Two or more CTCs was a strong predictor of progression and mortality in all subgroups of patients. The authors concluded that “CTCs predict&nbsp;nonresectability&nbsp;and impaired survival.

The overall survival and progression-free survival were worse in patients with CTCs, with hazard ratios of 2.47 for overall survival rate and 2.07 for progression-free survival.&nbsp;The authors concluded that “the detection of CTCs in peripheral blood of patients with&nbsp;resectable&nbsp;colorectal liver metastases or widespread metastatic CRC is associated with disease progression and poor survival.”</p>\r\n<p>Zhang et al.&nbsp;(2012) conducted a meta-analysis of published literature on the prognostic value of CTC in breast cancer. Forty-nine eligible studies enrolling 6,825 patients were identified. The presence of CTC was significantly associated with shorter survival in the total population&nbsp;and the prognostic value of CTC was significant in both early and metastatic breast cancer.

With respect to the independent cancers, Cabel et al. (2017) summarizes the clinical validity of CTC detection in Figure 1 . On the clinical utility of CTC, Cabel et al. (2017) initially stated “the clinical utility of CTC detection (i.e. does it improve patient outcome) has yet to be demonstrated before it can be implemented in routine clinical practice.” In recent time, it was seen that specific CTC features may have clinical utility in “[predicting] the sensitivity to specific immunotherapies,” and in the case of ER&#43; MBCs, ER-CTCs can develop and reflect “acquisition of therapy resistance by the primary tumor.” <strong>Figure 1.&nbsp;</strong>Clinical validity of circulating tumor cells (CTC): level of evidence according to clinical settings&nbsp;(Cabel et al., 2017).&nbsp;</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-f1737a9012"> Figure 1. Clinical validity of circulating tumor cells (CTC): level of evidence according to clinical settings (Cabel et al., 2017). Oxnard et al.&nbsp;(2016) found that: “Sensitivity of plasma genotyping for detection of T790M was 70%. Of 58 patients with T790M-negative tumors, T790M was detected in plasma of 18 (31%).

Although patients with T790M-negative plasma had overall favorable outcomes (ORR, 46%; median PFS, 8.2 months), tumor genotyping distinguished a subset of patients positive for T790M who had better outcomes (ORR, 69%; PFS, 16.5 months) as well as a subset of patients negative for T790M with poor outcomes (ORR, 25%; PFS, 2.8 months).”&nbsp;The authors concluded that “upon availability of validated plasma T790M assays, some patients could avoid a tumor biopsy for T790M genotyping.”</p>\r\n<p>A review by&nbsp;Sacher et al.&nbsp;(2016) genotyped 180 patients with NSCLC using plasma droplet PCR&nbsp;(plasma&nbsp;ddPCR).

In one study, a high sensitivity (92%) for EGFR mutations was found for utilizing exosomal RNA and ctDNA together and remained high in a subpopulation that’s been difficult for ctDNA assays to detect (88% sensitivity).

The authors compared EGFR analysis results between tissue DNA (tDNA) and ctDNA from 554 NSCLC cases. ctDNA analysis detected EGFR mutation in 57.3% of cases. ctDNA detection correlated with metastatic stage and disease progression (p<0.001). The authors followed up after an average of 41.09 month and found that, “survival analysis revealed ctDNA status and M stage (p < 0.001) to be independent predictors of overall survival in the multivariate analysis.” The authors conclude that ctDNS is clinically useful for EGFR analysis, but note the possibility of false negatives and recommend using tDNA to confirm ctDNA results in some situations.

Despite this, the figure below details their understanding of positive benefits in the potential utility of ctDNA across the cancer spectrum. Guidelines and Recommendations</h2>\r\n<h3><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN)</span></h3>\r\n<p>The NCCN guidelines for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) &nbsp;strongly advise “broader molecular profiling with the goal of identifying rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available, or to appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical trials. Broad molecular profiling is considered a key component of improving &nbsp;care for patients with NSCLC”. Furthermore, the NCCN states that “plasma or tissue-based testing via broad molecular profiling should be considered at progression for the T790M mutation and other genomic resistance mechanisms. If plasma-based testing is negative, tissue-based testing with re-biopsy material is strongly recommended.&nbsp;Practitioners may want to consider scheduling the biopsy concurrently with plasma testing referral.”</p>\r\n<p>However, the NCCN goes on to state that cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used in lieu of&nbsp;histologic&nbsp;tissue diagnosis. The NCCN notes that specificity is generally very high for cell-free tumor testing but is lacking in sensitivity&nbsp;(up to 30% false-negative rate)&nbsp;and that standards for analytic performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have not been well established. The use of cell-free or circulating tumor DNA may be considered in specific clinical situations, such as if a patient is medically unfit for an invasive tissue sampling&nbsp;or&nbsp;if there is insufficient material for a molecular analysis&nbsp;following pathologic confirmation of an NSSCLC diagnosis&nbsp;in the initial diagnostic setting (but “follow-up tissue-based analysis for all patients in which&nbsp;an oncogenic driver is not identified should be planned).” The NCCN notes that&nbsp;“data suggest that plasma ctDNA testing is a useful minimally invasive test that can be used to identify&nbsp;ALK, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, ROS1 and other oncogenic biomarkers that would not otherwise be identified in patients with metastatic NSCLC.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For NSCLC, the NCCN provides the following specific recommendations for liquid biopsy:&nbsp;“plasma ctDNA testing can be used in specific circumstances if 1) the patient is not medically fit for invasive tissue sampling or 2) there is insufficient tissue for molecular analysis and follow-up tissue-based analysis will be done if an oncogenic driver is not identified.</p>\r\n<p>The NCCN lists “comprehensive germline and somatic profiling to identify candidates for additional targeted therapies” as part of the workup for recurrent stage IV (M1) breast cancer.” They go on to specifically note that “tumor tissue or plasma-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays may be used and each of these have benefits and limitations for diagnosis and disease progression. Tissue-based assays have greater sensitivity, but ctDNA may reflect tumor heterogeneity more accurately. If one specimen is negative for actionable biomarkers, testing on the alternative specimen can be considered.” The NCCN also states that assessment of the PIK3CA mutation may be performed through liquid biopsy if the tumor is HR-positive, HER2 negative, and if therapy with alpelisib plus fulvestrant is being considered. Finally, for the management of breast cancer with liquid biopsy techniques, the NCCN states that “the clinical use of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) or circulating DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer is not yet included in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer for disease assessment and monitoring”, though the sentence that follows would indicate that this statement refers to a count of CTCs, not their use for genotyping: “Patients with persistently increased CTC after three weeks of first-line chemotherapy have a poor PFS and OS.”</p>\r\n<p>The NCCN states that AR-V7 testing in CTCs “can be considered to help guide selection of therapy in the post-abiraterone/enzulamide&nbsp;metastatic CRPC [castration-resistant prostate cancer] setting”. The NCCN does not comment on any particular liquid medium over another (e.g.&nbsp;urine, CSF, serum). However, the NCCN does specify&nbsp;the use of circulating DNA&nbsp;for&nbsp;rucaparib treatment, stating that “the preferred method of selecting patients for rucaparib treatment is somatic analysis of&nbsp;BRCA1&nbsp;and&nbsp;BRCA2&nbsp;using a circulating tumor DNA sample.”&nbsp;&nbsp;SelectMDx&nbsp;is also&nbsp;acknowledged&nbsp;by the NCCN; “the panel believes that&nbsp;SelectMDx&nbsp;score is potentially informative in patients who have never undergone biopsy, and it can therefore be considered in such individuals.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>With regards to circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in&nbsp;colon cancer, the NCCN “panel believes that there are insufficient data to recommend the use of multigene assays,&nbsp;Immunoscore, or post-surgical&nbsp;ctDNA&nbsp;to estimate risk of recurrence or determine adjuvant therapy.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For neuroendocrine tumors, NCCN notes that CTCs have been studied as prognostic markers, but state that more research is required.&nbsp;There is no single biomarker available that is satisfactory as a diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive marker.</p>\r\n<p>For&nbsp;a primary CNS lymphoma, the NCCN remarks that cerebrospinal fluid&nbsp;analysis&nbsp;may “possibly” include gene rearrangement&nbsp;evaluation.&nbsp;For leptomeningeal metastases, the NCCN notes that assessment of ctDNA&nbsp;or CTCs in CSF&nbsp;“increases sensitivity of tumor cell detection and assessment of response to treatment.”&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For pancreatic adenocarcinomas, the NCCN acknowledges that circulating cell-free DNA is being investigated as a biomarker for screening. The NCCN also notes that if tumor tissue is not available, cell-free DNA testing may be considered.</p>\r\n<p>For esophageal,&nbsp;esophagogastric&nbsp;junction&nbsp;cancers,&nbsp;and gastric cancers,&nbsp;the NCCN states&nbsp;“testing using a validated&nbsp;NGS-based [next generation sequencing] genomic profiling assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be considered. A negative result should be interpreted with caution, as this does not exclude the presence of tumor mutations or amplifications.</p>\r\n<p>For&nbsp;acute myeloid leukemia, the NCCN notes that&nbsp;“morphologically detectable,”&nbsp;circulating leukemic blasts from peripheral blood may be used to detect molecular abnormalities.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>For bladder cancer, the NCCN&nbsp;mentions&nbsp;RT-PCR&nbsp;testing for&nbsp;FGFR2/3&nbsp;gene&nbsp;alterations, but&nbsp;does not specify whether this can be done through a liquid biopsy&nbsp;or cell-free DNA.&nbsp;The only comment made is that the laboratory should be CLIA-approved.&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>The NCCN guidelines for small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma do not address use of CTCs, ctDNA, or liquid biopsy for patient management. In biliary tract cancers, the NCCN states that “a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) test may also be considered for identifying gene mutations. This technique may not reliably identify gene fusions or rearrangements depending on the panel used and the specific partner gene.”</p>\r\n<h4><span class=\&#34;rte--heading--xs\&#34;>American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)</span></h4>\r\n<p>In 2016, ASCO published updated recommendations for the use of tumor markers in treatment of&nbsp;metastatic&nbsp;breast cancer. ASCO found that although CTCs may be prognostic, they are not predictive for clinical benefit when used to guide or influence decisions on systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer. ASCO recommends clinicians to not use these markers as adjunctive assessments.&nbsp;Similarly, ASCO recommended against use of CTCs&nbsp;to guide decisions about adjuvant systemic therapy&nbsp;for individuals with early stage invasive breast cancer.&nbsp;In the 2022 update, ASCO states that there are insufficient data to recommend routine use of ctDNA and CTCs to monitor response to therapy among patients with metastatic breast cancer.</p>\r\n<p>However, in a 2023 rapid recommendation update ASCO adds the following:</p>\r\n<p style=\&#34;margin-left: 40.0px;\&#34;>“To aid in treatment selection, the Expert Panel recommends routine testing for emergence of ESR1 mutations at recurrence or progression on ET (with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative MBC. Testing should be performed on blood or tissue obtained at the time of progression, as ESR1 mutations develop in response to selection pressure during treatment and are typically undetectable in the primary tumor; blood-based ctDNA is preferred owing to greater sensitivity. If not performed earlier, testing for PIK3CA mutations should also be performed to guide further therapy. Patients whose tumor or ctDNA tests remain ESR1 wild-type may warrant retesting at subsequent progression(s) to determine if an ESR1 mutation has arisen.”</p>\r\n<p>In 2019, ASCO stated that clinicians “should not use circulating biomarkers as a surveillance strategy for detection of recurrence in patients who have undergone curative-intent treatment of stage I-III NSCLC or SCLC”. ASCO states that further data is required to validate this approach.</p>\r\n<p>In 2018, ASCO and the&nbsp;College of American Pathologists&nbsp;(CAP) released a joint review on&nbsp;“circulating&nbsp;tumor DNA&nbsp;analysis in&nbsp;patients&nbsp;with&nbsp;cancer”. In it, they note that apart from the assays that have received “regulatory appeal”, most assays have “insufficient evidence” for both clinical validity and clinical utility. They note discordant results between circulating DNA assays and tissue genotyping.

Where plasma NGS is not available owing to technical and economic constraints, single-gene or low multiplex-based approaches may represent appropriate alternatives. Use of limited PCR analysis for EGFR mutations as the initial step in molecular assessment, for example, remains highly relevant in areas of the world where the EGFR mutation rate is high.

S. Food and Drug Administration has not approved or cleared this test; however, FDA clearance or approval is not currently required for clinical use.</p>\r\n&#34;}}" id="text-880b2133fe"> Guidelines and Recommendations National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) The NCCN guidelines for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) strongly advise “broader molecular profiling with the goal of identifying rare driver mutations for which effective drugs may already be available, or to appropriately counsel patients regarding the availability of clinical trials. Broad molecular profiling is considered a key component of improving care for patients with NSCLC”. Furthermore, the NCCN states that “plasma or tissue-based testing via broad molecular profiling should be considered at progression for the T790M mutation and other genomic resistance mechanisms. If plasma-based testing is negative, tissue-based testing with re-biopsy material is strongly recommended. Practitioners may want to consider scheduling the biopsy concurrently with plasma testing referral.” However, the NCCN goes on to state that cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used in lieu of histologic tissue diagnosis. The NCCN notes that specificity is generally very high for cell-free tumor testing but is lacking in sensitivity (up to 30% false-negative rate) and that standards for analytic performance characteristics of cell-free tumor DNA have not been well established. The use of cell-free or circulating tumor DNA may be considered in specific clinical situations, such as if a patient is medically unfit for an invasive tissue sampling or if there is insufficient material for a molecular analysis following pathologic confirmation of an NSSCLC diagnosis in the initial diagnostic setting (but “follow-up tissue-based analysis for all patients in which an oncogenic driver is not identified should be planned).” The NCCN notes that “data suggest that plasma ctDNA testing is a useful minimally invasive test that can be used to identify ALK, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, MET exon 14 skipping, RET, ROS1 and other oncogenic biomarkers that would not otherwise be identified in patients with metastatic NSCLC.” For NSCLC, the NCCN provides the following specific recommendations for liquid biopsy: “plasma ctDNA testing can be used in specific circumstances if 1) the patient is not medically fit for invasive tissue sampling or 2) there is insufficient tissue for molecular analysis and follow-up tissue-based analysis will be done if an oncogenic driver is not identified. The NCCN lists “comprehensive germline and somatic profiling to identify candidates for additional targeted therapies” as part of the workup for recurrent stage IV (M1) breast cancer.” They go on to specifically note that “tumor tissue or plasma-based circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays may be used and each of these have benefits and limitations for diagnosis and disease progression. Tissue-based assays have greater sensitivity, but ctDNA may reflect tumor heterogeneity more accurately. If one specimen is negative for actionable biomarkers, testing on the alternative specimen can be considered.” The NCCN also states that assessment of the PIK3CA mutation may be performed through liquid biopsy if the tumor is HR-positive, HER2 negative, and if therapy with alpelisib plus fulvestrant is being considered. Finally, for the management of breast cancer with liquid biopsy techniques, the NCCN states that “the clinical use of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) or circulating DNA (ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer is not yet included in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer for disease assessment and monitoring”, though the sentence that follows would indicate that this statement refers to a count of CTCs, not their use for genotyping: “Patients with persistently increased CTC after three weeks of first-line chemotherapy have a poor PFS and OS.” The NCCN states that AR-V7 testing in CTCs “can be considered to help guide selection of therapy in the post-abiraterone/enzulamide metastatic CRPC [castration-resistant prostate cancer] setting”. The NCCN does not comment on any particular liquid medium over another (e.g. urine, CSF, serum). However, the NCCN does specify the use of circulating DNA for rucaparib treatment, stating that “the preferred method of selecting patients for rucaparib treatment is somatic analysis of BRCA1 and BRCA2 using a circulating tumor DNA sample.” SelectMDx is also acknowledged by the NCCN; “the panel believes that SelectMDx score is potentially informative in patients who have never undergone biopsy, and it can therefore be considered in such individuals.” With regards to circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in colon cancer, the NCCN “panel believes that there are insufficient data to recommend the use of multigene assays, Immunoscore, or post-surgical ctDNA to estimate risk of recurrence or determine adjuvant therapy.” For neuroendocrine tumors, NCCN notes that CTCs have been studied as prognostic markers, but state that more research is required. There is no single biomarker available that is satisfactory as a diagnostic, prognostic, or predictive marker. For a primary CNS lymphoma, the NCCN remarks that cerebrospinal fluid analysis may “possibly” include gene rearrangement evaluation. For leptomeningeal metastases, the NCCN notes that assessment of ctDNA or CTCs in CSF “increases sensitivity of tumor cell detection and assessment of response to treatment.” For pancreatic adenocarcinomas, the NCCN acknowledges that circulating cell-free DNA is being investigated as a biomarker for screening. The NCCN also notes that if tumor tissue is not available, cell-free DNA testing may be considered. For esophageal, esophagogastric junction cancers, and gastric cancers, the NCCN states “testing using a validated NGS-based [next generation sequencing] genomic profiling assay performed in a CLIA-approved laboratory may be considered. A negative result should be interpreted with caution, as this does not exclude the presence of tumor mutations or amplifications. For acute myeloid leukemia, the NCCN notes that “morphologically detectable,” circulating leukemic blasts from peripheral blood may be used to detect molecular abnormalities. For bladder cancer, the NCCN mentions RT-PCR testing for FGFR2/3 gene alterations, but does not specify whether this can be done through a liquid biopsy or cell-free DNA. The only comment made is that the laboratory should be CLIA-approved. The NCCN guidelines for small cell lung cancer and hepatocellular carcinoma do not address use of CTCs, ctDNA, or liquid biopsy for patient management. In biliary tract cancers, the NCCN states that “a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) test may also be considered for identifying gene mutations. This technique may not reliably identify gene fusions or rearrangements depending on the panel used and the specific partner gene.” American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) In 2016, ASCO published updated recommendations for the use of tumor markers in treatment of metastatic breast cancer. ASCO found that although CTCs may be prognostic, they are not predictive for clinical benefit when used to guide or influence decisions on systemic therapy for metastatic breast cancer. ASCO recommends clinicians to not use these markers as adjunctive assessments. Similarly, ASCO recommended against use of CTCs to guide decisions about adjuvant systemic therapy for individuals with early stage invasive breast cancer. In the 2022 update, ASCO states that there are insufficient data to recommend routine use of ctDNA and CTCs to monitor response to therapy among patients with metastatic breast cancer. However, in a 2023 rapid recommendation update ASCO adds the following: “To aid in treatment selection, the Expert Panel recommends routine testing for emergence of ESR1 mutations at recurrence or progression on ET (with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative MBC. Testing should be performed on blood or tissue obtained at the time of progression, as ESR1 mutations develop in response to selection pressure during treatment and are typically undetectable in the primary tumor; blood-based ctDNA is preferred owing to greater sensitivity. If not performed earlier, testing for PIK3CA mutations should also be performed to guide further therapy. Patients whose tumor or ctDNA tests remain ESR1 wild-type may warrant retesting at subsequent progression(s) to determine if an ESR1 mutation has arisen.” In 2019, ASCO stated that clinicians “should not use circulating biomarkers as a surveillance strategy for detection of recurrence in patients who have undergone curative-intent treatment of stage I-III NSCLC or SCLC”. ASCO states that further data is required to validate this approach. In 2018, ASCO and the College of American Pathologists (CAP) released a joint review on “circulating tumor DNA analysis in patients with cancer”. In it, they note that apart from the assays that have received “regulatory appeal”, most assays have “insufficient evidence” for both clinical validity and clinical utility. They note discordant results between circulating DNA assays and tissue genotyping. Furthermore, they remark on the lack of evidence for use in monitoring therapy effectiveness, diagnosing early-stage cancer, or cancer screening. However, they point to evidence that well-validated assays may support initiation of targeted therapy. National Academy of Clinical Biochemistry (NACB) now known as the American Association for Clinical Chemistry (AACC) In 2010, the NACB issued practice guidelines for the use of tumor markers in liver, bladder, cervical, and gastric cancers. It found that CTCs had “questionable” clinical utility in the assessment of liver cancer and did not recommend their use. The NACB published an updated guideline in 2020. For liver cancer, they note circulating cell-free serum DNA as “undergoing evaluation” for “predictive marker for distant metastasis of hepatitis C virus–related HCC.” The plasma proteasome is also undergoing evaluation for “assessment of early HCC in patients with chronic viral chronic hepatitis; assessment of metastatic potential of HCC.” Finally, circulating methylated DNA is undergoing evaluation for HCC screening, detection, and prognosis. No other circulating tumor markers for bladder, cervical, and gastric cancers were mentioned. College of American Pathologists (CAP), the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer (IASLC), and the Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP) An expert panel was convened to review and update the CAP-IASLC-AMP Molecular Testing Guideline for Selection of Lung Cancer Patients for EGFR and ALK Tyrosine Kinase Inhibitors. This panel consists of practicing pathologists, oncologists, and a methodologist. The panel states there is “insufficient evidence to support the use of circulating cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) molecular methods for the diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma”. According to the panel, there is also “insufficient evidence to support the use of circulating tumor cell (CTC) molecular analysis for the diagnosis of primary lung adenocarcinoma, the identification of EGFR or other mutations, or the identification of EGFR T790M mutations at the time of EGFR TKI-resistance.” However, the panel acknowledges that “In some clinical settings in which tissue is limited and/or insufficient for molecular testing, physicians may use a cell-free plasma DNA (cfDNA) assay to identify EGFR mutations.” In 2021, the IASLC published an updated consensus statement on liquid biopsy testing.

As noted previously, bTMB is an emerging biomarker, pending completion of ongoing prospective randomized trials and refinement of methodology. American Society for Clinical Pathology, College of American Pathologists, Association for Molecular Pathology, and American Society of Clinical Oncology These joint guidelines from these societies were published regarding molecular biomarkers for colorectal cancer. Despite the potential of liquid biopsy for assessment of tumor recurrence and treatment resistance, the technique “awaits robust validation and further studies to determine their clinical utility.” European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) and Chinese Society of Clinical Oncology (CSCO) These guidelines state that liquid biopsy can be used as “the initial test for the detection of a T790M mutation [for EGFR in NSCLC], and if tests are negative, a re-biopsy should be attempted if feasible.” The European Association of Urology (EAU), European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO), European Society of Urogenital Radiology (ESUR), and the International Society of Geriatric Oncology (SIOG) The joint guidelines on prostate cancer state that “In asymptomatic individuals with a prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level between three and ps.

The guidelines state that “the use of multigene assays, CDX2 expression analysis, and ctDNA may be used to complement multidisciplinary decision-making for patients with stage II or III colon cancer.” State and Federal Regulations, as applicable Food and Drug Administration (FDA) There are four FDA-approved liquid biopsy tests as of January 10, 2023.
