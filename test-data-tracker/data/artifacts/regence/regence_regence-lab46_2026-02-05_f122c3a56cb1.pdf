services that the members are likely to be financially responsible for the cost of these services. 
 
DESCRIPTION 
Liquid biopsy refers to the analysis of circulating tumor/cell-free DNA (ctDNA or cfDNA) or 
circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as methods of noninvasively characterizing tumors and tumor 
genome from the peripheral blood.

BACKGROUND 
CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA 
Normal and tumor cells release small fragments of DNA into the blood, which is referred to as 
cell-free DNA (cfDNA). Cell-free DNA from nonmalignant cells is released by apoptosis. Most 
cell-free tumor DNA is derived from apoptotic and/or necrotic tumor cells, either from the 
primary tumor, metastases, or CTCs.
[1]
 Unlike apoptosis, necrosis is considered a pathologic 
process and generates larger DNA fragments due to incomplete and random digestion of 
genomic DNA. The length or integrity of the circulating DNA can potentially distinguish 
between apoptotic and necrotic origin. Circulating tumor DNA can be used for genomic 
characterization of the tumor. 
CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS 
Intact CTCs are released from a primary tumor and/or a metastatic site into the bloodstream. 
The half-life of a CTC in the bloodstream is short (1-2 hours), and CTCs are cleared through 
extravasation into secondary organs.
[1]
 Most assays detect CTCs through the use of surface 
epithelial markers such as EpCAM and cytokeratins. The primary reason for in detecting CTCs 
is prognostic, through quantification of circulating levels. 
DETECTING CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA AND CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS 
Detection of ctDNA is challenging because ctDNA is diluted by nonmalignant circulating DNA 
and usually represents a small fraction (<1%) of total cfDNA. Therefore, more sensitive 
methods than the standard sequencing approaches (e.g., Sanger sequencing) are needed. 
Highly sensitive and specific methods have been developed to detect ctDNA, for both single 
nucleotide variants (e.g. BEAMing [which combines emulsion polymerase chain reaction with 
magnetic beads and flow cytometry] and digital polymerase chain reaction) and copy-number 
variants. Digital genomic technologies allow for enumeration of rare variants in complex 
mixtures of DNA. 
Approaches to detecting ctDNA can be considered targeted, which includes the analysis of 
known genetic mutations from the primary tumor in a small set of frequently occurring driver 

LAB46 |  6 
mutations, which can impact therapy decisions or untargeted without knowledge of specific 
variants present in the primary tumor, and include array comparative genomic hybridization, 
next-generation sequencing, and whole exome and genome sequencing. 
CTC assays usually start with an enrichment step that increases the concentration of CTCs, 
either by biologic properties (expression of protein markers) or physical properties (size, 
density, electric charge). CTCs can then be detected using immunologic, molecular, or 
functional assays.
[1]
 
TARGETED TREATMENTS FOR SOLID TUMORS 
There are many targeted treatments available for various solid tumor cancers. A list of some 
that have been approved by the FDA can be found in at their website listing the tests and 
associated companion diagnostics. 
BLOOD-BASED MULTI-CANCER SCREENING 
Cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US following heart disease. Many cancers 
appear to have a better prognosis if diagnosed early in their natural history. This has led to 
efforts to detect preclinical cancers in asymptomatic persons through screening. However, 
screening tests have associated benefits and harms that must be considered when evaluating 
whether a test should be used in a population.  
Cancer screening tests such as ‘liquid biopsies’ that are minimally invasive and can 
simultaneously detect multiple types of cancer have been called multicancer early detection 
(MCED) tests. The primary benefit of screening for cancer is the potential to diagnose cancer 
at an earlier stage or detect precursor lesions that can be treated with less aggressive or more 
effective treatment, thereby theoretically improving the length or quality of life. Thus, cancer-
specific mortality and quality of life are the primary outcomes of interest for assessing benefit. 
However, mortality is a demanding outcome that requires long follow-up times and a large 
number of participants in order to produce reliable and precise estimates. 
Longitudinal examination of the population-based, age-standardized stage distribution of all 
cancers may give early information on the likelihood of a survival benefit. However, it is 
possible for screening to increase the proportion of early-stage cancers that are detected 
without reducing the absolute incidence of advanced cancer because of overdiagnosis. 
Population-based screening is applied to asymptomatic people without signs of disease. The 
prevalence of any given cancer is generally low. Therefore, the majority of those screened for 
a particular cancer are not destined to develop clinically significant cancer that needs 
treatment and therefore do not benefit from screening. However, all persons screened are at 
risk of harm from either the screening test or the cascade of events following from a positive 
screening test. 
The majority of harms from cancer screening come from downstream cascading events. The 
harms may arise from the diagnostic work-up of false positive screens, from diagnosis and 
treatment of overdiagnosed cancers, and from false negative screens for those cancers where 
screens are already part of standard care. 
The harms from the diagnostic work-up of false positives depends on the false positive rate 
and on the nature of the work-up. The false positive rate per screening test may be low, but 
given that many screening strategies include repeated screening tests over many years or a 

LAB46 |  7 
lifetime, the absolute number of people with complications as a result of a false-positive 
diagnostic work-up can be considerable. In addition, in the context of a test for multiple 
cancers, false positives can occur across several diseases. 
Additionally, overdiagnosis of cancer that would not have become burdensome during an 
individual’s lifetime leads to unnecessary treatments along with their associated risks. 
There is also the potential for false-negative test results to cause harm. For example, for those 
cancers that already have established screening recommendations as part of standard care 
(e.g., breast, prostate), the new cancer screening test might alter individuals’ adherence to 
existing recommendations which could lead to missed early diagnoses. 
REGULATORY STATUS 
The CellSearch® System (Janssen Diagnostics, formerly Veridex) is the only FDA-approved 
device for monitoring patients with metastatic disease and CTCs. In 2004, the CellSearch® 
System was cleared by FDA for marketing through the 510(k) process for monitoring 
metastatic breast cancer, in 2007 for monitoring metastatic colorectal cancer, and in 2008 for 
monitoring metastatic prostate cancer. The system uses automated instruments manufactured 
by Immunicon for sample preparation (CellTracks® AutoPrep) and analysis (CellSpotter 
Analyzer®), together with supplies, reagents, and epithelial cell control kits manufactured by 
Veridex. FDA product code: NQI. 
Signatera® (Natera) is a laboratory developed test regulated under CLIA. The test has not 
been cleared or approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), but has received 3 
Breakthrough Device Designations from FDA. 
No blood-based multi-cancer screening tests have been approved or cleared by the U.S. Food 
and Drug Administration (FDA). Several tests, including Galleri® (GRAIL), CanScan™ 
(Geneseeq), OverC™ Multi-Cancer Detection Blood Test (Burning Rock) have been granted 
breakthrough device designation by the FDA. 
EVIDENCE SUMMARY 
Validation of the clinical use of any diagnostic test focuses on three main principles: 
1.  Analytic validity of the test;  
2.  Clinical validity of the test (i.e., sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative 
predictive values in relevant populations of patients and compared to the gold 
standard); and  
3.  Clinical utility of the test (i.e., how the results of the diagnostic test will be used to 
improve the management of the patient). 
The context of this literature search focuses on treatment selection, monitoring treatment 
response, risk prediction, and screening in asymptomatic individuals. Validation studies are 
limited;  therefore, this review is predominately focused on studies that correlate survival and 
risk of disease progression.  
SELECTING TREATMENT IN ADVANCED CANCER 
Treatment selection is informed by tumor type, grade, stage, patient performance status and 
preference, prior treatments, and the molecular characteristics of the tumor such as the 
presence of driver mutations. One purpose of liquid biopsy testing of patients who have 

LAB46 |  8 
advanced cancer is to inform a decision regarding treatment selection (e.g., whether to select 
a targeted treatment or standard treatment).  
Liquid biopsies are easier to obtain and less invasive than tissue biopsies. True-positive liquid 
biopsy test results lead to the initiation of appropriate treatment (e.g., targeted therapy) without 
tissue biopsy. False-positive liquid biopsy test results lead to the initiation of inappropriate 
therapy, which could shorten progression-free survival. 
In patients able to undergo tissue biopsy, negative liquid biopsies reflex to tissue testing. In 
patients unable to undergo tissue biopsy, a negative liquid biopsy result would not change 
empirical treatment. Therefore, health outcomes related to negative test results do not differ 
between liquid biopsy and tissue biopsy. 
CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists jointly 
convened an expert panel to review the current evidence on the use of ctDNA assays.
[2]
 The 
literature review included a search for publications on the use of ctDNA assays for solid tumors 
in March 2017 and covers several different indications for the use of liquid biopsy. The search 
identified 1,338 references to which an additional 31 references were supplied by the expert 
panel. Seventy-seven articles were selected for inclusion. The summary findings are discussed 
in the following sections, by indication. 
Merker (2018) concluded that while a wide range of ctDNA assays have been developed to 
detect driver mutations, there is limited evidence of the clinical validity of ctDNA analysis in 
tumor types outside of lung cancer and colorectal cancer (CRC). Preliminary clinical studies of 
ctDNA assays for detection of potentially targetable variants in other cancers such as BRAF 
variants in melanoma
[3]
 and PIK3CA and ESR1 variants in breast cancer were identified.
[4, 5]
 
Since the end date of the searches conducted by Merker  (2018), a number of observational 
studies have been published for various ctDNA tests. For example, two observational studies 
of the clinical validity of FoundationOne® Liquid (formerly FoundationACT®) in patients with 
various cancers compared liquid biopsy to tissue biopsy with FoundationOne®    comprehensive 
genomic testing.
[6, 7]
 Additional studies have assessed the validity of other tests, including the 
Guardant360 test
[8, 9]
 and OncoBEAM™ CRC assay
[10-13]
. Given the breadth of molecular 
diagnostic methodologies available to assess ctDNA, the clinical validity of each commercially 
available test must be established independently. Multiple high-quality studies are needed to 
establish the clinical validity of a test. 
Direct evidence of clinical utility is provided by studies that have compared health outcomes for 
patients managed with and without the test. Because these are intervention studies, the 
preferred evidence would be from randomized controlled trials. Merker (2018) concluded that 
no such trials have been reported for ctDNA tests.
[2]
 
CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS 
In breast cancer, observations that estrogen receptor−positive tumors can harbor estrogen 
receptor−negative CTCs,
[14, 15]
 that overt distant metastases and CTCs can have discrepant 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) status compared with the primary tumor,
[16-
18]
 and that the programmed death-ligand 1 is frequently expressed on CTCs in patients with 

LAB46 |  9 
hormone receptor–positive, HER2-negative breast cancer
[19]
 have suggested that trials 
investigating whether CTCs can be used to select targeted treatment are needed. 
The clinical validity of each commercially available CTC test must be established 
independently.
 Indirect evidence on clinical utility rests on clinical validity. If the evidence is 
insufficient to demonstrate test performance, no inferences can be made about clinical utility. 
The evidence is insufficient to demonstrate test performance for currently available CTC tests; 
therefore, no inferences can be made about clinical utility. 
MONITORING TREATMENT RESPONSE IN CANCER 
Monitoring of treatment response in cancer may be performed using tissue biopsy or imaging 
methods. Another proposed purpose of liquid biopsy testing in patients who have advanced 
cancer is to monitor treatment response, which could allow for changing therapy before clinical 
progression and potentially improve outcomes. Standard monitoring methods for assessing 
treatment response are tissue biopsy or imaging methods. 
CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA 
Merker (2018) identified several proof-of-principle studies demonstrating correlations between 
changes in ctDNA levels and tumor response or outcomes as well as studies demonstrating 
that ctDNA can identify the emergence of resistance variants.
[2]
 However, authors reported a 
lack of rigorous, prospective validation studies of ctDNA-based monitoring and concluded that 
clinical validity had   not been established. Additionally, the authors concluded that there is no 
evidence that changing treatment before clinical progression, at the time of ctDNA progression, 
improves patient outcomes. T herefore, no inferences can be made about clinical utility. 
CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS 
Two randomized controlled trials have evaluated the clinical utility of using CTC to guide 
treatment decisions in patients with metastatic breast cancer. 
Bidard (2021) reported on a noninferiority trial comparing CTC-driven and clinician-driven first-
line therapy choice in patients with metastatic breast cancer.
[20]
 Median PFS was 15.5 months 
(95% confidence interval [CI]  12.7 to 17.3) in the CTC arm and 13.9 months (95% CI 12.2 to 
16.3) in the standard arm. The primary end point was met, with a hazard ratio (HR) of 0.94 
(90% CI 0.81 to 1.09). 
Smerage (2014) reported on the results of a randomized controlled trial of patients with 
metastatic breast cancer and persistently increased CTC levels to test whether changing 
chemotherapy after one cycle of first-line therapy could improve overall survival (OS; the 
primary study outcome).
[21]
 Patients who did not have increased CTC levels at baseline 
remained on initial therapy until progression (arm A), patients with initially increased CTC 
levels that decreased after 21 days of therapy remained on initial therapy (arm B), and patients 
with persistently increased CTC levels after 21 days of therapy were randomized to continue 
initial therapy (arm C1) or change to an alternative chemotherapy (arm C2). There were 595 
eligible and evaluable patients, 276 (46%) of whom did not have increased CTC levels (arm 
A). Of patients with initially increased CTC levels, 31 (10%) were not retested, 165 were 
assigned to arm B, and 123 were randomized to arms C1 or C2. There was no difference in 
median OS between arms C1 (10.7 months) and C2 (12.5 months,  p=0.98). CTC levels were 
strongly prognostic, with a median OS for arms A, B, and C (C1 and C2 combined) of 35 

LAB46 |  10 
months, 23 months, and 13 months, respectively (p<0.001). This trial showed the prognostic 
significance of CTCs in patients with metastatic breast cancer receiving first-line 
chemotherapy, but also that there was no effect on overall survival if patients with persistently 
increased CTC levels after 21 days of first-line chemotherapy were switched to alternative 
cytotoxic therapy. 
Trials demonstrating that use of CTCs to monitor treatment for the purpose of making 
treatment changes are needed to demonstrate clinical utility.
 Indirect evidence on clinical utility 
rests on clinical validity. If the evidence is insufficient to demonstrate test performance, no 
inferences can be made about clinical utility. The evidence is insufficient to demonstrate test 
performance for currently available CTC tests; therefore, no inferences can be made about 
clinical utility through a chain of evidence. 
PREDICTING RISK OF RELAPSE 
Monitoring for relapse after curative therapy in patients with cancer may be performed using 
imaging methods and clinical examination. Another proposed purpose of liquid biopsy testing 
in patients who have cancer is to detect and monitor for residual tumor, which could lead to 
early treatment that would eradicate residual disease and potentially improve outcomes.
 
Standard monitoring methods for detecting relapse are imaging methods and clinical 
examination. 
CIRCULATING TUMOR DNA AND CIRCULATING TUMOR CELLS 
Chidambaram (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of the clinical utility of 
circulating tumor DNA testing in esophageal cancer.
[22]
 Four retrospective studies (n=233, 
range 35 to 97) provided data to assess ctDNA for monitoring for recurrence after treatment. 
The pooled sensitivity was 48.9% (range 29.4% to 68.8%) and specificity was 95.5% (range 
90.6% to 97.9%). 
Merker (2018) identified several proof-of-principle studies demonstrating an association 
between persistent detection of ctDNA after local therapy and high risk of relapse.
[2]
 However, 
current studies are retrospective and have not systematically confirmed that ctDNA is being 
detected before the metastatic disease has developed. They concluded that the performance 
characteristics had not been established for any assays. 
Rack (2014) published results of a large multicenter study in which CTCs were analyzed in 
2026 patients with early breast cancer before adjuvant chemotherapy and in 1492 patients 
after chemotherapy using the CellSearch System.
[23]
 After chemotherapy, 22% of patients 
were CTC-positive, and CTC positivity was negatively associated with prognosis. 
Smaller studies demonstrating associations between persistent CTCs and relapse have been 
published in prostate cancer,
[24]
 CRC,
[25]
 bladder cancer,
[26, 27]
 liver cancer,
[28]
 and esophageal 
cancer.
[29]
 
Merker (2018) concluded that there is no evidence that early treatment before relapse, based 
on changes in ctDNA, improves patient outcomes.
[2]
 Similarly, no trials were identified 
demonstrating that treatment before relapse based on changes in CTCs improves patient 
outcomes. 
Signatera® 

LAB46 |  11 
Colorectal Cancer 
Chidharla (2023) published a systematic review and meta-analysis of 23 studies (n=3,568) 
investigating the use of ctDNA as a biomarker for minimal residual disease in patients with 
CRC after curative-intent surgery; only three of the included studies used the Signatera® 
ctDNA assay.
[30]
 Loupakis (2021) evaluated the association of Signatera® on survival 
outcomes in 112 individuals who had undergone resection for metastatic CRC, and the 
sensitivity of Signatera testing was compared to digital droplet polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) testing, but not to standard methods to identify recurrence, such as CEA and 
imaging.
[31]
   Henriksen (2022) assessed the added benefit of serial ctDNA analysis; with 
samples taken at diagnosis, following surgery, during adjuvant therapy, and at follow up.
[32]
 
Kotani (2023) analyzed presurgical and postsurgical ctDNA levels in a large (n=1,039) 
prospective study that included patients with stage II to IV resectable CRC, and found that 
postsurgical ctDNA positivity at four weeks after surgery was associated with a significantly 
higher risk of recurrence (HR 10.0, 95% CI 7.7 to 14, p<0.0001), and identified patients who 
derived a benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy.
[33]
 The results of the meta-analysis 
demonstrated that ctDNA positivity (including all tests, not just Signatera®) after surgery was 
associated with a significantly higher risk of recurrence, with a pooled HR of 7.27 for all stages 
of CRC. Furthermore, post-adjuvant chemotherapy ctDNA positivity was associated with an 
even higher risk of recurrence (pooled HR 10.59). 
Several additional non-randomized studies have evaluated CTC tests for colon cancer 
recurrence. For example, Reinert (2019) enrolled 125 patients with stage I to III colon cancer in 
a validation study of the Signatera® assay.
[34]
 Plasma samples were collected before surgery, 
at 30 days following surgery, and every three months for up to three years. The recurrence 
rate at three years was 70% in patients with a positive ctDNA test (7 of 10) compared to 11.9% 
(10 of 84) of those with a negative ctDNA test. In multivariate analyses, ctDNA status was 
associated with recurrence after adjusting for clinicopathological risk factors including stage, 
lymphovascular invasion, and microradical resection status. 
Fakih (2022) directly compared Signatera® testing to other surveillance strategies in 
individuals with resected colorectal cancer in a retrospective observational study.
[35]
 This study 
was unique in that it used NCCN recommended guidelines for surveillance and ctDNA testing 
was performed at the same interval as standard surveillance with CEA and imaging. Test 
characteristics for Signatera® were not significantly different from standard imaging 
techniques. Estimates were imprecise, with wide confidence intervals. 
Altogether, five nonrandomized studies, for of which were noncomparative, examined the 
association of Signatera® testing to prognosis in individuals with CRC. They differed in their 
study designs, populations (e.g., stage of disease), frequency and timing of standard care, 
outcome measures, and timing of follow up. Three studies evaluated the association between 
positive ctDNA results and prognosis in CRC. These studies did not provide comparisons of 
ctDNA testing to standard methods of risk stratification for therapy selection, monitoring 
response to therapy, or early relapse detection. One retrospective study compared Signatera® 
testing to other surveillance strategies in individuals with resected colorectal cancer. There are 
no randomized controlled trials, and no studies in which Signatera®    testing was used to guide 
treatment decisions. 
Signatera® for Breast Cancer 

LAB46 |  12 
Two noncomparative studies reported the association of Signatera® testing with survival 
outcomes in breast cancer. There are no randomized controlled trials, and no studies in which 
Signatera® testing was used to guide treatment decisions. Coombes (2019) evaluated 
Signatera® for disease surveillance in 49 individuals who had received surgery and adjuvant 
therapy for stage I to III breast cancer of various subtypes.
[36]
 In this study, the test detected 
ctDNA in 16 of 18 individuals who subsequently relapsed, and the presence of ctDNA test was 
associated with poorer prognosis. Magbanua (2021) evaluated the test as a predictor of 
response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in 84 individuals with nonmetastatic breast cancer who 
were enrolled in the I-SPY2 trial.
[37]
 In this population, ctDNA positivity decreased during the 
course of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, from 73% before treatment, to 35% at three weeks, to 
14% at the inter-regimen time point, and down to 9% after chemotherapy. HRs for recurrence 
indicate that positive predictive value increased over time. Major limitations of both studies 
include a lack of comparison to standard methods of monitoring, and heterogeneity in the 
study populations. 
Signatera® for Bladder Cancer 
Two nonrandomized studies have reported an association between Signatera®    testing and 
prognosis in bladder cancer. 
Christensen (2019) assessed the association of ctDNA with prognosis in 68 individuals with 
localized advanced bladder cancer.
[38]
 The presence of ctDNA at diagnosis, after 
chemotherapy but before cystectomy, and after cystectomy were significantly associated with 
recurrence (HR 29.1, p=0.001; HR 12.0, p<0.001, and HR 129.6, p<0.001, respectively). Data 
from
 a 68-month follow-up of this cohort were reported by Lindskrog (2023), who additionally 
reported on the association of ctDNA with prognosis in a separate cohort of 102 patients who 
did not receive neoadjuvant chemotherapy and had ctDNA testing before and after cystectomy 
(median follow-up of 72 months).
[39]
 Results demonstrated that ctDNA was prognostic 
regardless of whether or not patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy before cystectomy. 
Powles (2021) reported the association of a positive Signatera® test with treatment response 
in 581 individuals who had undergone surgery for urothelial cancer and were enrolled in a trial 
of atezolizumab versus observation.
[40]
 Study participants who were positive for ctDNA had 
improved disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival in the atezolizumab arm versus the 
observation arm (DFS HR 0.58,  95% CI 0.43 to 0.79, p=0.0024; overall survival HR, 0.59, 95% 
CI 0.41 to 0.86). No difference in DFS or overall survival between treatment arms was noted 
for patients who were negative for ctDNA. At two-year follow up, ctDNA status remained 
prognostic and no relapses were observed in the ctDNA-negative patients at baseline and after 
neoadjuvant therapy. 
Study limitations, including a lack of comparison to tests used for the same purpose preclude 
drawing conclusions about clinical validity and usefulness. No study reported management 
changes made in response to ctDNA test results. There is no direct evidence that the use of 
the test improves health outcomes, and indirect evidence is not sufficient to draw conclusions 
about clinical validity. 
Signatera® for Additional Indications 
The evidence for the use of Signatera® to detect relapse in non-small cell lung cancer 
(NSCLC) following surgery is limited to a subgroup analysis of 24 individuals enrolled in 
TRACERx, a longitudinal cohort study of tumor sampling and genetic analysis in individuals 

LAB46 |  13 
with NSCLC.
[41]
 Of 14 individuals with confirmed relapse, 13 (93%) had a positive ctDNA test 
(defined as at least two single-nucleotide variants detected). Of 10 individuals with no relapse 
after a median follow up of 775 days (range 688 to 945 days), one had a positive ctDNA test 
(10%). Major limitations include no comparison to standard surveillance methods and 
imprecise estimates due to the small sample size. Additionally, the commercially available 
Signatera® has been updated since this publication. 
One noncomparative retrospective study reported the association of Signatera® testing 
measured before and after surgery with relapse and recurrence in 17 individuals with 
esophageal adenocarcinoma.
[42]
 Patients who were ctDNA-positive before surgery had 
significantly poorer DFS (p=0.042), with a median DFS of 32.0 months vs. 63.0 months in 
ctDNA-negative preoperative patients. This study was limited by the very small number sample 
size, and its retrospective design. 
Bratman (2020) evaluated the use of Signatera® to predict treatment response in 106 
individuals receiving pembrolizumab for solid tumors, including squamous cell cancer of head 
and neck, triple negative breast cancer, high-grade serous ovarian cancer, malignant 
melanoma, and mixed solid tumors.
[43]
 Lower-than-median ctDNA levels at baseline were 
associated with improved overall survival (adjusted HR 0.49, 95% CI 0.29 to 0.83) and PFS 
(adjusted HR 0.54; 95% CI, 0.34 to 0.85). Among participants with at least two ctDNA 
measurements, any rise in ctDNA levels during surveillance above baseline was associated 
with rapid disease progression and poor survival (median overall survival of 13.7 months), 
whereas among 12 patients whose ctDNA cleared during treatment, overall survival was 100% 
at a median follow up of 25.4 months (range 10.8 to 29.5 months) following the first clearance. 
This single-center study is limited by its small sample size and variability in results across 
different tumor types. The study did not include a comparison of monitoring with ctDNA to 
standard methods of monitoring response such as repeat imaging. 
Colvera® 
Murray (2018) enrolled 172 patients with invasive colorectal cancer with plasma samples 
collected within 12 months after surgery.
[44]
 In this study, multivariate analysis found that risk of 
recurrence was increased among patients who had positive Colvera® tests following surgery. 
Risk of colorectal cancer-related death was also increased among patients who had a positive 
ctDNA test following surgery, but multivariate analysis could not be performed for this outcome 
due to the low number of events. 
Symonds (2020) examined the association between a positive Colvera® test result and 
recurrence of colorectal cancer in 144 patients who had no evidence of residual disease after 
surgical resection and/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy.
[45]
 Blood samples were also tested for 
carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), and the association between a positive CEA test and 
recurrent colorectal cancer was assessed. A positive Colvera® test was an independent 
predictor of recurrence, while a positive CEA test was not found to be a significant predictor of 
recurrence after adjusting for other predictors of recurrence (e.g., stage at primary diagnosis). 
Sensitivity of the Colvera® assay for detecting recurrence was significantly greater than the 
sensitivity of CEA (66% vs. 31.9%, p=0.001), but specificity was not significantly different 
(97.9% vs. 96.4%, p=1.00). The positive predictive value was not significantly different for 
Colvera®    and CEA (94.3% vs. 83.3%, p=0.262), but the negative predictive value was 
significantly greater for Colvera® (84.4% vs. 71.7%, p<0.001). 

LAB46 |  14 
Musher (2020) conducted an additional prospective cross-sectional observational study in 
patients undergoing surveillance after definitive therapy for stage II or III colorectal cancer.
[46]
 
Samples were collected within six months of planned radiologic surveillance imaging and 
tested using the Colvera® assay and a CEA assay. A total of 322 patients were included, with 
27 experiencing recurrence and 295 not experiencing recurrence. The sensitivities of Colvera® 
and CEA for detecting colorectal cancer recurrence using a single time-point blood test were 
63% (17/27) and 48.1% (13/27), respectively (p=0.046). The specificities of single time-point 
Colvera®    and CEA were 91.5% and 96.3%, respectively (p=0.012). 
While several non-randomized studies have shown   an association between Colvera® ctDNA 
results and risk of recurrence, they are limited by their observational design and relatively 
small numbers of patients. Management decisions were not based on test results. There are 
no controlled studies of management changes made in response to Colvera®    test results 
compared to other risk factors, and no studies showing whether testing improved outcomes. 
SCREENING FOR CANCER IN ASYMPTOMATIC INDIVIDUALS 
It has been proposed that liquid biopsy tests, such as the Galleri® test (Grail), could be used to 
screen asymptomatic patients for early detection of cancer, which could allow for initiating 
treatment at an early stage, potentially improving outcomes. The outcome of primary interest is 
progression-free survival. Diagnosis of cancer that is not present or would not have become 
clinically important (false-positives and overdiagnosis) would lead to unnecessary treatment 
and treatment-related morbidity. 
GALLERI® 
Schrag (2023) reported results of the PATHFINDER prospective study of the Galleri®    test. 
PATHFINDER enrolled 6,662 adults aged 50 years or older without signs or symptoms of 
cancer from oncology and primary care outpatient clinics at seven U.S. health networks 
between 2019 and 2020.
[47]
 A total of 6,621 participants had analyzable results and were 
included in the analysis; 64% of participants were women and 92% were White. The reference 
standard was a cancer diagnosis established by pathological, laboratory, or radiographic 
confirmation. Diagnostic assessments were coordinated by, and at the discretion of, the 
participant's doctor. Participants were followed for 12 months. A cancer signal was detected by 
the Galleri®    test in 92 (1.4%) participants. In two of those participants, diagnostic assessments 
began before Galleri test results were reported. Thirty-five of the participants with a positive 
Galleri® test were diagnosed with cancer; 57 of the participants with a positive Galleri®    test 
had no cancer diagnosis. The median time to diagnostic resolution was 79 days (interquartile 
range [IQR] 37 to 219). A total of 76 of the 90 participants with positive Galleri®    test results 
had laboratory tests, 83 (92%) had at least one imaging test, 44 (53%) had more than one 
imaging study, and 44 (49%) had at least one procedure. Within 12 months of enrollment, 122 
cancers were diagnosed in 121 participants: 35 (29%) detected by Galleri®; 38 (31%) detected 
through other screening tests; 48 (40%) clinically detected. Overall positive predictive value 
(PPV) was 35/92 (38%,  95% CI 29 to 48). Negative predictive value (NPV) was 
6,  235/6,321(99%,  95% CI 98 to 99). Specificity was 6,235/6,290 (99%,  95% CI 99 to 99). 
Sensitivity was not reported in the publication but is 35/121 (29%,  95% CI 21 to 38) based on 
the values provided. A correct first or second prediction of tissue of origin was returned for 33 
(97%) of 34 true positives. 
There are no studies demonstrating clinical utility of the Galleri test. A randomized controlled 
trial is underway in the United Kingdom, conducted within the National Health Service, to test 

LAB46 |  15 
whether Galleri®    can reduce the number of late-stage cancers.
[48]
 The trial has enrolled over 
140,000 people from the general population of England ages 50 to 77 years who did not have 
or were not being investigated for cancer. Participants were randomized to have their blood 
tested using Galleri®    or to the control group who will have their blood stored. Blood is being 
collected up to three times annually. Follow-up is underway. The study registration indicates 
that the estimated study completion date is in 2026. 
A systematic review by Wade (2025) evaluated the evidence for blood-based multi-cancer 
early detection testing as screening tests.
[49]
 Thirty-six studies met the inclusion criteria, 
including one ongoing randomized controlled trial; other studies were cohort or case-control 
studies. According to the authors, “None of the studies were of good quality, mainly because 
they did not properly check whether the test result might have been incorrect and whether 
participants with a negative test result actually had cancer.” Additional limitations were noted 
regarding study populations and lack of patient-relevant outcomes such as mortality, harms, or 
health-related quality of life. 
The review by Merker (2018) reported that there is no evidence of clinical validity for the use of 
ctDNA in asymptomatic individuals.
[2]
  
Systematic reviews with meta-analyses have evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of CTCs in 
patients with gastric and bladder/urothelial cancer.
[50, 51]
 Reported sensitivity was low in both 
cancers (42% and 35%) overall. Sensitivity was lower in patients with early-stage cancer, 
suggesting that the test would not be useful as an initial screen. 
The evidence is insufficient to demonstrate test performance for currently available ctDNA and 
CTC tests as a screening test for cancer; therefore, no inferences can be made about clinical 
utility through a chain of evidence. 
PRACTICE GUIDELINE SUMMARY 
AMERICAN SOCIETY OF CLINICAL ONCOLOGY 
The American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 2022 guideline update on biomarkers for 
systemic therapy in metastatic breast cancer (MBC) does not recommend the use of ctDNA as 
a biomarker to monitor the response to therapy (Type of recommendation: informal consensus-
based; Quality of evidence: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate).
[52]
 The guidelines 
also provide the following recommendations: 
• Patients with locally recurrent unresectable or metastatic hormone receptor-positive and 
human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2)-negative breast cancer who are 
candidates for a treatment regimen that includes a phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase 
inhibitor and hormonal therapy should undergo testing for PIK3CA mutations using next-
generation sequencing of tumor tissue or circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in plasma to 
determine their eligibility for treatment with the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase inhibitor 
alpelisib plus fulvestrant. If no mutation is found in ctDNA, testing in tumor tissue, if 
available, should be used as this will detect a small number of additional patients with 
PIK3CA mutations (Type: evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms; Evidence quality: 
high; Strength of recommendation: strong). 
• There are insufficient data at present to recommend routine testing for ESR1 mutations 
to guide therapy for hormone receptor-positive, HER2-negative MBC. Existing data 
suggest reduced efficacy of aromatase inhibitors (AIs) compared with the selective 

LAB46 |  16 
estrogen receptor degrader fulvestrant in patients who have tumor or ctDNA with ESR1 
mutations (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: insufficient; Strength of 
recommendation: moderate). 
• There are insufficient data to recommend routine use of ctDNA to monitor response to 
therapy among patients with MBC (Type: informal consensus; Evidence quality: low; 
Strength of recommendation: moderate). 
NATIONAL COMPREHENSIVE CARE NETWORK 
There is no general National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guideline on the use of 
liquid biopsy. Refer to treatment recommendations by cancer type (see examples below). 
The National Comprehensive Care Network (NCCN) Clinical Practice Guidelines for colon 
cancer (v.4.2025) does not include circulating tumor cells or circulating tumor DNA in the 
treatment algorithms and states that “Circulating tumor (ctDNA) is a prognostic marker; 
however,  there is currently insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of ctDNA assays 
outside of a clinical trial. De-escalation of care and treatment decision-making are not 
recommended based on ctDNA results.”
[53]
 
The NCCN guidelines for breast cancer (v.4.2025) state that “tumor tissue or plasma-based 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) assays may be used and each of these have benefits and 
limitations for diagnosis and disease progression. Tissue-based assays have greater 
sensitivity for some alterations, but ctDNA may reflect tumor heterogeneity more accurately.” 
They also state that the “clinical use of circulating tumor cells or ctDNA in metastatic breast 
cancer is not yet included in algorithms for disease assessment and monitoring. Patients with 
persistently increased CTC after 3 weeks of first-line chemotherapy have a poor PFS and 
OS.”
[54]
 
For NSCLC (v.8.2025), the NCCN guidelines state that cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing 
should not be used in lieu of a histological tissue diagnosis, and that “ctDNA is not routinely 
recommended in settings other than advanced/metastatic disease. For stages I–III, tissue-
based testing is preferred. Metastatic disease confined to the thorax may have a higher yield 
with tissue-based testing.”
[55]
 The guidelines state that limitations of ctDNA testing include: 
• Low tumor fraction/ctDNA; some assays include a measure of ctDNA fraction, which 
can aid in identification of situations in which low ctDNA fraction might suggest 
compromised sensitivity 
• The presence of mutations from sites other than the target lesion, most commonly 
clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP) or postchemotherapy marrow 
clones. KRAS and TP53 can be seen in either of these circumstances 
• The inherent ability of the assay to detect fusions or other genomic variation of 
relevance 
NCCN Guidelines on Genetic/Familial High-risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, and Pancreatic 
(v.1.2026) make the following statement regarding screening with ctDNA tests:
[56]
 
“For individuals at increased hereditary risk for cancer, use of pre-symptomatic ctDNA cancer 
detection assays should only be offered in the setting of prospective clinical trials, because the 
sensitivity, false-positive rates, and positive predictive value of ctDNA tests for early-stage 
disease, which are needed to derive clinical utility and determine clinical validity, are not fully 
defined. The psychological impact of ctDNA testing remains unknown. For these reasons 

LAB46 |  17 
ctDNA should not be used, outside of the clinical trial setting, to replace well-established 
methods of cancer screening (eg, mammography)” 
SUMMARY 
Although there is limited evidence regarding the clinical utility of circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) testing in patients with cancer, this testing may help to determine eligibility for FDA-
approved targeted cancer treatments for advanced or metastatic breast cancer that is 
estrogen receptor (ER)-positive and HER2-negative, and for other solid tumors when tumor 
tissue is not available. Therefore, this testing may be considered medically necessary when 
policy criteria are met. 
There is not enough research to show that testing for variants in circulating tumor DNA 
(ctDNA) to select targeted treatment improves health outcomes when policy criteria are not 
met. This includes ctDNA testing as an adjunct to, or replacement for tumor tissue testing, 
when tumor tissue is possible, or testing when there is no FDA-approved targeted treatment 
for the indication. Plasma-based ctDNA testing is generally less sensitive than tumor tissue 
testing and may identify changes that are not associated with the tumor.  Therefore, this 
testing is considered investigational when medical necessity criteria are not met. Note that 
expanded tumor tissue panels to select targeted treatment are addressed in a separate 
policy and may not be covered for some indications. 
There is not enough research to show that testing for circulating tumor/cell-free DNA (ctDNA 
or cfDNA) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) for purposes other than targeted treatment 
selection can improve overall health outcomes for patients.  Various ctDNA and CTC tests 
have been proposed to detect the presence or recurrence of solid tumor cancers. However, 
the impact such testing on health outcomes has not been clearly demonstrated in 
prospective studies. In addition, no clinical practice guidelines based on research 
recommended routine use of this type of testing in patient management. Therefore, CTC and 
ctDNA testing that is not for the purpose of selecting a targeted treatment, including but not 
limited to measurable residual disease (MRD) testing or cancer screening in asymptomatic 
individuals, is considered investigational.
