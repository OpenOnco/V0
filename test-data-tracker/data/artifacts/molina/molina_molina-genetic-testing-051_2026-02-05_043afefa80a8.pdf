DISCLAIMER  
This Molina Clinical Policy (MCP) is intended to facilitate the Utilization Management process. Policies are not a supplementation or recommendation 
for treatment; Providers are solely responsible for the diagnosis, treatment, and clinical recommendations for the Member. It expresses Molina's 
determination  as  to  whether  certain  services  or  supplies  are  medically  necessary,  experimental,  investigational,  or  cosmetic  for  purposes  of 
determining  appropriateness  of  payment.  The  conclusion  that  a  particular  service  or  supply  is  medically  necessary  does  not  constitute  a 
representation or warranty that this service or supply is covered (
e.g., will be paid for by Molina) for a particular Member. The Member's benefit plan 
determines coverage – each benefit plan defines which services are covered, which are excluded, and which are subject to dollar caps or other 
limits.  Members  and  their  Providers  will  need  to  consult  the  Member's  benefit  plan  to  determine  if  there  are  any  exclusion(s)  or  other  benefit 
limitations applicable to this service or supply. If there is a discrepancy between this policy and a Member's plan of benefits, the benefits plan will 
govern. In addition, coverage may be mandated by applicable legal requirements of a State, the Federal government or CMS for Medicare and 
Medicaid Members. CMS's Coverage Database can be found on the CMS website. The coverage directive(s) and criteria from an existing National 
Coverage Determination (NCD) or Local Coverage Determination (LCD) will supersede the contents of  this MCP and provide the directive for all 
Medicare members. References included were accurate at the time of policy approval and publication. 
OVERVIEW        
Genetic  testing  is  defined  by  the  National  Human  Genome  Research  Institute  (NHGRI)  as  an  array  of  laboratory 
techniques to examine an individual’s DNA (DeoxyriboNucleic  Acid). There are 4 “types” or letters of DNA. The 
sequence of these letters “code” for information required for health. These letters are repeated in long sequences. 
These  long  sequences  are  packaged  into  chromosomes  much  like  books  of  information.  The  total  number  of  DNA 
letters making up a complete set of instructions is about 6.4 billion letters (3.2 billion form the mother and 3.2 from the 
father). The complete set of genetic instructions for a person is called the genome. The genetic code or genome is a 
type of blueprint that tells cells when to grow and when not to grow and how to function to maintain health. A copy of 
the genome is in just about every cell in the human body. The genetic code is also linked to clinical appearances of a 
trait or disease (phenotype). 
 
Genetic testing determines a person's genotype (the order and number of DNA letters of a small part of the genome). 
Genotyping can help diagnose certain conditions and provide information about certain treatments.  Genotyping does 
this by comparing a portion of the person’s genetic code or genotype to a reference code. The reference code is what 
is thought to be a “healthy” code or typical genetic code. When there are differences between a person’s genetic code 
and the reference code an interpretation is required to determine  if the change  (variant)  is meaningful or  not. Most 
changes  from  the  reference  genetic  code  do  not  affect  health  (benign  variants),  but  when  variants  are  potentially 
disease causing, we call them pathogenic variants.  
Genotyping can be determined for germline cells (cells that contain the genetic information inherited form our parents 
and copied to all the cells we are born with) or for certain somatic cells (cells that may or may not represent the original 
genetic information inherited from our parents because of changes to the genetic code since birth). For example, cells 
that “acquire” genetic changes after we are born that alter or remove instructions for stopping  cell  growth  may  be 
considered tumor cells.  
Germline variants are changes in the DNA letters (nucleotide sequence) you are born with. Genetic changes that occur 
to a person’s DNA after they are born are called somatic variants or changes. Somatic changes can happen because 
of exposure to certain chemicals or ultraviolet radiation from the sun or just changes to DNA that sometimes occur as 
we grow and become older.  
Genetic tests are used as a health care tool to detect gene variants associated with a specific disease or condition, as 
well  as  for  non-clinical  uses  such  as  paternity  testing  and  forensics.  In  the  clinical  setting,  genetic  tests  can  be 
performed to determine the genetic cause of a disease, confirm a suspected diagnosis, predict future illness, detect 
when an individual might pass a genetic mutation to his or her children, and predict response to therapy. They can be 
used to screen newborns and fetuses which may help diagnose and treat disease before symptoms develop. Genetic 
testing of embryos can also occur as part of the in vitro fertilization process (NHGRI 2020; NHGRI 2019).   
There are many types of genetic tests. A very brief look at the types of genetic tests is as follows:  
• Whole genome sequence: the broadest genetic test examining all the letters of the genome 
• Whole exome sequence: a broad test that looks at just the important coding portions of the genome 
• Karyotype: a test that looks at a low level of resolution of all the chromosomes

• Chromosomal microarray: a test that looks at chromosomes in greater detail (multiple types of microarrays) 
• Panel: a genetic test that looks at a smaller number of genes focused on 1 or multiple conditions 
• Single gene test: a genetic test of just one gene 
• Targeted testing: a genetic test that looks at a few DNA letters (or small subsets of other genetic segments) 
• Pharmacogenomic test: a type of targeted testing looking at genes involved in drug metabolism 
• Tumor marker genotyping: a panel test looking for genes that drive tumor growth &/or identify a tumor type 
 
Genetic testing also has ethical, legal, and psychosocial  implications. These include psychosocial consequences of 
testing; disclosure to family members; testing children; undisclosed familial relationships; and genetic discrimination. 
Protections  for  discrimination  are  covered  under  the  Americans  with  Disabilities  Act,  the  Genetic  Information 
Nondiscrimination Act, and the Affordable Care Act (Kohlmann & Slavotinek 2022). 
 
Genetic Counseling 
 
The  National  Society  of  Genetic  Counselors  defines  genetic  counseling  as  the  process  of  aiding  individuals  to 
understand and acclimate to the medical, psychological, and familial implications of genetic contributions to disease. 
Genetic counseling includes the compilation of a  detailed family  history;  interpretation  of the family history  with the 
medical  history  to  assess  the  chance  of  disease  occurrence  or  recurrence;  patient  and  family  education  about  the 
inheritance, testing, management, risk reduction, resources, and research regarding the individual’s specific condition; 
and  counseling  to  help  the  individual  make  informed  choices  to  provide  appropriate  interventions.  Indications  for 
referral can include, but are not limited to, personal or family history of a confirmed clinical diagnosis with a known 
genetic etiology (e.g., hemophilia, neurofibromatosis, Marfan syndrome). Genetic testing may also be warranted when 
an individual has an increased risk due to genetic or environmental factors or uncertainty about genetic risks (Raby & 
Kohlmann 2022). 
 
Federal regulation of genetic tests is conducted by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), the Centers for Medicare 
and  Medicaid  Services  (CMS),  and  the  Federal  Trade  Commission  (NHGRI  2020).  The  FDA  regulates  medical 
products and devices while the CMS Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments of 1988 (CLIA) provides regulation 
of  clinical  laboratories  and  testing  services.  Additional  regulation  exists  for  laboratories  that  develop  laboratory-
developed tests – this includes tests developed for use only in one laboratory. While largely federally regulated, some 
laboratories are also regulated at the State-level (
ADLM 2024; ADLM 2020; HHS 2008). 
 
Access to Genetic Testing Information 
 
 
 
The Genetic Testing Registry (GTR) provides a central location for voluntary submission of genetic test information by 
providers. This includes the purpose of a given test, laboratory contact information and credentials, as well as the test’s 
methodology, validity, and evidence of usefulness. Overall, the aim of the GTR is to advance public health and research 
into the genetic basis of health and disease (National Center for Biotechnology Information, n.d.). 
 
GeneReviews  is  a  searchable  database  of  summaries  of  genetic  disorders,  their  diagnosis,  management,  and  key 
points in  genetic counseling. Experts on the specific  condition write the individual chapters; GeneReviews  contains 
over 800 chapters. Chapters are reviewed every four to five years or as necessary (Adam et al. 2025). 
 
 
 
 
 
 
COVERAGE POLICY  
 
 
For ALL requests, Molina uses this clinical policy as a baseline overarching policy where specific criteria do 
not exist.  Where specific MCG criteria exist those criteria explicit to the test should be followed. Please note 
mandatory biomarker coverage and state legal requirements may supersede this policy. 
Genetic testing is considered medically necessary and may be authorized when the following criteria are met:  
1. The genetic test is ordered by a practitioner within the scope of their practice or a medical geneticist 
2.    One  of  the  following  applies  based  on  the  type  of  genetic  testing  (broad  vs  narrow  scope,  non-cancer  vs 
cancer, carrier screening, predictive testing or pharmacogenomics) requested: 

       
Molina Clinical Policy 
Genetic Testing: Policy No. 051 
Last Approval: 02/12/2025   
Next Review Due By: February 2026 
 
Molina Healthcare, Inc. ©2025 – This document contains confidential and proprietary information of Molina Healthcare   
and cannot be reproduced, distributed, or printed without written permission from Molina Healthcare.                                                   page 3 of 38 
 
a. For inherited conditions with a broad scope of testing (e.g., whole exome, chromosomal microarray or 
karyotype) not related to carrier screening or cancer, documentation of the following is a necessary first step: 
(If condition specific guidelines are available in MCG, please see the more specific guideline for a complete 
list of criteria.) 
i. Clinical history, physical examination, pedigree analysis and completion of conventional diagnostic 
testing AND a definitive diagnosis remains uncertain AND an inherited condition is suspected based 
on the presence of documented key risk factors, for example:  
(1) Major congenital anomalies unexplained by teratogenic or environmental exposures 
(2) Three or more minor anomalies 
(3) Autism 
(4) Intellectual disability not explained by trauma, teratogen or environmental exposures (including 
maternal exposures) 
(5) Global developmental delay 
(6) Developmental regression not related to autism or epilepsy 
(7) Severe psychological disturbances such as self-injurious behavior, sleep-wake cycle reversal, 
schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, Tourette Syndrome 
(8) Complex    neurodevelopmental    disorders    (ataxia,    dystonia,    alternating    hemiplegia, 
neuromuscular disorder) 
(9) Evidence of a metabolic disorder 
(10) Unexplained growth retardation or failure to thrive or asymmetry 
(11) History of 3 or more miscarriages or still-births 
(12) Epilepsy  with  a  suspected  genetic  cause  (not  due  to  tumor,  trauma,  teratogen  or  other 
environmental exposures) 
 
b. For inherited conditions with a narrow scope of testing (condition specific panels): documentation of a 
major   feature   or   multiple   minor   features   of   the   syndrome   is   required   (e.g.,   neurofibromatosis-1:  
neurofibroma or multiple café au lait macules and inguinal freckling) 
c. For  inherited cancer risk  syndromes (for  example Lynch syndrome, Hereditary Breast Ovarian Cancer 
syndrome and others): documentation of relevant personal history (e.g., early onset cancer, multiple colon 
polyps  or  rare  pathologic  findings),  and/or  family  history  (inheritance  pattern  of  early  onset  cancers  – 
pedigree), as well as relevant ancestral background is required 
d. For cancer marker testing (somatic or tumor marker testing), carrier screening and pharmacogenomics: 
At a minimum such testing should have:  
i. Analytical and clinical validity (validation that the test measures what it says it measures and that 
measurement is linked to clinical disease or drug metabolism) 
ii. Clinical utility (results  of the test can meaningfully change clinical management  e.g.,  surgery, the 
extent  of  surgery,  a  change  in  surveillance,  hormonal  manipulation,  or  a  change  from  standard 
therapeutic or adjuvant chemotherapy) 
iii. Please note guidelines specific to diagnose or monitor cancer conditions, carrier screening, or tests 
to determine drug metabolism (pharmacogenomics) may be available 
e. For predictive testing of known familial variants, documentation confirming a causative genetic change 
has been identified in an affected family member and that genetic change is actionable for the member e.g., 
could  change  medical  management  (see  also  special  considerations  below  regarding  minors  not  being 
tested  for  adult-onset  conditions).  This  type  of  testing  is  used  only  when  there  is  a  previously  identified 
variant  in  a  family  member  and  that  variant  causes  a  serious  condition.  This  testing  is  used  when  an 
asymptomatic  family  member  who  has  not  had  testing  would  like  to  know  if  they  inherited  that  familial 
pathogenic variant and it would change medical management 
3. Pre-test  genetic  counseling  must  be  performed  by  a  board-certified  medical  geneticist,  certified  genetic 
counselor,  or  provider experienced  in  delivering genetic information (e.g., OB/GYN,  neuro-geneticist) when a 
genetic  condition  is  suspected.  Exception:  genetic  counseling  is  not  necessary  for  genetic  tests  aimed  at 
understanding drug metabolism for medication choice, dosing, or non-inherited cancers (“acquired” cancers)

4. Clinical documentation supports the validity and clinical utility of test results.  The results have the potential to 
significantly alter the management or treatment of disease 
5. The testing ordered is reasonable in scope, and the risks of testing do not outweigh its benefits. For example, it 
is not reasonable to order a whole exome sequence (looks at the coding sequences for approximately 20,000 
genes) when looking for a single point mutation in one gene 
6. The clinical testing laboratory must be accredited by the Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) 
or a CLIA waiver is in place or accredited by the State and/or other applicable accrediting agencies
 
 
 
 
Limitations and Exclusions 
 
 
 
Frequency Limitations: 
 
1. Testing is allowed once during the member’s lifetime per disease for diagnostic purposes
 
2. A second genetic test may be authorized in one of the following circumstances: 
 
a. The genetic test identifies other mutations not previously tested and is different from the original test 
 
b. The genetic test measures gene expressions or  identifies somatic mutations which can vary over  time, 
when clinically appropriate
 
Genetic testing is NOT considered medically necessary under the following circumstances: 
1. Criteria other than those outlined under the “Coverage Criteria” section above 
2. Testing  for  conditions  or  purposes  where  the  test  results  would  not  directly  influence  the  management  or 
treatment of the disease or condition (e.g., disease without known treatment). Refer to the  Corporate / Health 
Plan experimental and investigational policy as appropriate 
3. Testing for informational purposes or management of a member’s family member 
4. For cases of carrier testing when there is no meaningful impact on health outcomes 
5. Minors under the age of 18 for adult-onset conditions that have no preventative or therapeutic options 
6. Population screening in individuals without a personal or family history (except for State mandated or required 
newborn screening or prenatal screening for certain conditions) 
7. More than one lifetime test for each disease or condition except as defined above
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS. Molina Healthcare reserves the right to require that additional documentation be made available as part of 
its coverage determination; quality improvement; and fraud; waste and abuse prevention processes. Documentation required may  include, but is 
not limited to, patient records, test results and credentials of the provider ordering or performing a drug or service. Molina Healthcare may deny 
reimbursement or take additional appropriate action if the documentation provided does not support the initial determination that the drugs or services 
were medically necessary, not investigational, or experimental, and otherwise within the scope of benefits afforded to the member.
