V. Additional Definitions 
Medical  Necessity  or  Medically  Necessary  means  Covered  Services  rendered  by  a  Health  Care  Provider  that  the  Plan 
determines are: 

 
a. appropriate for the symptoms and diagnosis or treatment of the Member's condition, illness, disease or 
injury; 
b. provided for the diagnosis, and the direct care and treatment of the Member's condition, illness disease or 
injury; 
c. in accordance with current standards of good medical treatment practiced by the general medical 
community. 
d. not primarily for the convenience of the Member, or the Member's Health Care Provider; and 
e. the most appropriate source or level of service that can safely be provided to the Member.  When applied 
to hospitalization, this further means that the Member requires acute care as an inpatient due to the nature 
of the services rendered or the Member's condition, and the Member cannot receive safe or adequate care 
as an outpatient. 
 
Medicaid Business Segment 
Medically Necessary — A service, item, procedure, or level of care that is necessary for the proper treatment or 
management of an illness, injury, or disability is one that: 
• Will, or is reasonably expected to, prevent the onset of an illness, condition, injury or disability. 
• Will, or is reasonably expected to, reduce or ameliorate the physical, mental or developmental effects of an 
illness, condition, injury or disability. 
• Will assist the Member to achieve or maintain maximum functional capacity in performing daily activities, taking 
into account both the functional capacity of the Member and those functional capacities that are appropriate for 
Members of the same age 
 
DESCRIPTION:  
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) refers to a subclinical measure of cancer burden that remains during and following 
treatment.  MRD status is a reliable indicator of clinical outcome and response to therapy such as drug resistance. Results 
can be used for risk stratification and to guide treatment options when used in conjunction with other clinical and 
molecular data in multiple malignancy types. MRD detection can identify patients at risk of recurrence earlier and is a 
practical addition to disease monitoring, following intervention. 
 
MRD testing is recommended at a regular intervals over a specific time period. MRD testing often requires two types of 
assays to be performed as part of the service. First, a sample is taken from tumor diagnostic material to establish a 
baseline (solid and/or liquid) tumor signature as defined by the test methodology. This is followed by a series of assays 
run on a minimally invasive specimen (i.e., liquid biopsy or bone marrow aspirate) to detect the presence or recurrence of 
tumor based on the measured biomarkers, expression, or other analytes over various timepoints. This series of assays 
comprises a single test when the patient is known to have cancer. 
 
ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS 
 
Signatera (Natera) 0340U  The Signatera test is personalized and tumor-informed, tailored to fit the unique 
signature of clonal mutations found in that individual's tumor.  Signatera is offered for bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, 
melanoma, ovarian, and malignancies of unknown origin.  This test can be performed as a standalone test, or as a tumor-
informed test.

• Recurrence monitoring after curative-intent procedure 
 
Colorectal Cancer 
• Stage II and III colorectal cancer 
• Recurrence monitoring after curative-intent treatment procedure

NavDx Test 0356U    
 
NavDx test is considered to be medically necessary for the surveillance of recurrence in members with a personal history 
of documented HPV-driven oropharyngeal cancer, who presently have no evidence of disease, starting three months 
following completion of any regimen of curative intent therapy, with a frequency of: 
• not more often than every three months for the first 24 months thereafter, 
• not more often than every six months for the next 36 months thereafter, 
• not more often than annually thereafter until if and when a positive test result is detected 
 
TruSight Oncology Comprehensive (0543U)  
TruSight Oncology Comprehensive is considered medically necessary for the following indications: 

• Members with solid malignant tumors that have specific RNA changes in the NTRK1, NTRK2, and NTRK3 genes 
detected by the test may benefit from personalized treatment with VITRAKVI (larotrectinib). 
• Members with non-small cell lung cancer who have certain RNA mutations in the RET gene may benefit from 
personalized treatment with RETEVMO (selpercatinib).

For the Medicare and Medicaid Business Segments 
Although there is no National Coverage Determination issued for this service, CMS directives may allow MRD testing to 
be considered for coverage when used to predict risk of recurrence risk in members with personal history of cancer where 
treatment intent is curative. 
 
Effective 12/26/2021 Palmetto GBA established a formal coverage policy for all Medicare patients. This local carrier 
determination is applicable nationally. Please refer to policy numbers L38779 and A58376 on Centers for Medicare & 
Medicaid Services website.   Coverage criteria under the policy have been met for (1) the diagnosis of disease 
progression, recurrence, or relapse for colon cancer and (2) monitoring of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy for any solid tumor.  
 
Coverage of ClonoSeq (baseline assay and multiple follow-up assays) is indicated for Acute lymphoblastic leukemia 
(ALL), Multiple myeloma (MM), and Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL). Since Adaptive Biotechnologies is located in 
Seattle Washington, Noridian Healthcare Solutions, LLC policy A58997 applies. 
 
EXCLUSIONS: 
The use of MRD NGS tests not specified in this policy will be considered unproven and therefore, NOT COVERED. 
 
Note: A complete description of the process by which a given technology or service is evaluated and determined 
to be experimental, investigational or unproven is outlined in MP 15 - Experimental Investigational or Unproven 
Services or Treatment. 
 
Medicaid Business Segment: 
Any requests for services, that do not meet criteria set in the PARP, may be evaluated on a case by case basis. 
 
CODING ASSOCIATED WITH:  
The following codes are included below for informational purposes and may not be all inclusive. Inclusion of a 
procedure or device code(s) does not constitute or imply coverage nor does it imply or guarantee provider 
reimbursement.  Coverage is determined by the member specific benefit plan document and any applicable laws 
regarding coverage of specific services. Please note that per Medicare coverage rules, only specific CPT/HCPCS 
Codes may be covered for the Medicare Business Segment.  Please consult the CMS website at www.cms.gov or 
the local Medicare Administrative Carrier (MAC) for more information on Medicare coverage and coding 
requirements.
