MP360 Minimal Residual Disease NGS Testing – Revised – Add Indications 
 
DESCRIPTION:  
Minimal Residual Disease (MRD) refers to a subclinical measure of cancer burden that remains during 
and following treatment.  MRD status is a reliable indicator of clinical outcome and response to therapy 
such as drug resistance. and Results can be used for risk stratification and to guide treatment options 
when used in conjunction with other clinical and molecular data in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), 
acute myeloid  leukemia (AML), and multiple myeloma (MM). multiple malignancy types. MRD detection 
can identify patients at risk of recurrence earlier and is a practical addition to disease monitoring, 
following intervention. 
 
MRD testing is recommended at a regular intervals over a specific time period. MRD testing often 
requires two types of assays to be performed as part of the service. First, a sample is taken from tumor 
diagnostic material to establish a baseline (solid and/or liquid) tumor signature as defined by the test 
methodology. This is followed by a series of assays run on a minimally invasive specimen (i.e., liquid 
biopsy or bone marrow aspirate) to detect the presence or recurrence of tumor based on the measured 
biomarkers, expression, or other analytes over various timepoints. This series of assays comprises a 
single test when the patient is known to have cancer. 
 
Signatera (Natera) 0340U is a personalized molecular residual disease assay (MRD) using 
circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA), custom designed for each patient to help identify relapse of disease. The 

Signatera test is personalized and tumor-informed, tailored to fit the unique signature of clonal mutations 
found in that individual's tumor.  Signatera is offered for bladder, breast, colorectal, lung, melanoma, 
ovarian, and malignancies of unknown origin.  This test can be performed as a standalone test, or as a 
tumor-informed test. 
INDICATIONS: 
 
Colorectal Cancer:  
• Stage II-IV and oligometastatic colorectal cancer (CRC) in the adjuvant and recurrence 
monitoring setting 
 
Breast Cancer:  
• Stage II-IV breast cancer in the neoadjuvant setting, regardless of subtype 
• Stage IIb and higher breast cancer in the adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings 
 
Muscle invasive bladder cancer (MIBC): 
• in the adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings 
 
Ovarian / Fallopian Tube / Peritoneal Cancer: 
• Stage II-IV in the adjuvant and recurrence monitoring settings 
 
Any Solid Tumor: 
• For monitoring of response to immune-checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy 
 
ClonoSeq  0364U 
 
INDICATIONS: 
MRD testing (e.g., clonoSEQ) is considered to be medically necessary when performed in members with: 
 
Multiple myeloma: 
• During surveillance after response to primary treatment 
• After each treatment phase (e.g. after induction therapy, high-dose therapy/autologous stem-cell 
transplantation, 
consolidation, and maintenance) 
 
Acute myeloid leukemia:

Guardant Reveal 
 
INDICATIONS:  
MRD testing  (ctDNA Guardant Reveal) is a tissue-free test. It is considered to be medically necessary 
when performed in members with: 
 

Breast Cancer 
• Stage I, II, or III breast cancer 
• Recurrence monitoring after curative-intent procedure 
 
Colorectal Cancer 
• Early-stage Stage II and III colorectal cancer 
• Recurrence monitoring after curative-intent treatment procedure  
 
Lung Cancer 
• Stage II and III lung cancer 
 
This test is not yet validated in other tumor types. 
 
 
For the Medicare and Medicaid Business Segments 
Although there is no National Coverage Determination issued for this service, CMS directives may allow 
MRD Signatera ClonoSeq and/or Guardant Reveal testing to be considered for coverage when used to 
predict risk of recurrence risk in patients members with colon personal history of cancer where treatment 
intent is curative. 
 
Effective 12/26/2021 Palmetto GBA established a formal coverage policy for all Medicare patients. This 
local carrier determination is applicable nationally. Please refer to policy numbers L38779 and A58376 on 
Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services website.   Coverage criteria under the policy have been met for 
(1) the diagnosis of disease progression, recurrence, or relapse for colon cancer and (2) monitoring of

insufficient evidence in the peer-reviewed published medical literature to establish the effectiveness of 
these digital applications on health outcomes when compared to established tests or technologies.  
*NOTE: Natural Cycles is currently the only FDA-cleared fertility app (A9293) 
 
The Plan does NOT provide coverage for direct to consumer devices to monitor personal biometrics,
