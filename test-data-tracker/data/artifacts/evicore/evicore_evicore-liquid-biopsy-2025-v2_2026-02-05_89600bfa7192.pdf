Criteria
Introduction
Requests for liquid biopsy testing are reviewed using the following criteria.
Companion Diagnostic (CDx) Liquid Biopsy Assay
Liquid biopsy-based companion diagnostic assays are considered medically necessary
when the member meets ALL of the following criteria:
• Member has a diagnosis of cancer, AND
• Treatment with a medication for which there is a liquid biopsy-based FDA-approved
companion diagnostic is being considered, AND
• FDA approval for the CDx being requested must include the member's specific
cancer type as an approved indication, AND
• FDA label for the drug and indication being considered states companion diagnostic
testing is necessary for member selection, AND
• Member has not had previous somatic and/or germline testing that would
have identified the genetic change required to prescribe the medication under
consideration, AND
• Family history:
◦ Member does not have a close (1st or 2nd degree) biological relative with a known
germline mutation in a gene that is a target of the requested companion diagnostic
test (e.g. known familial mutation in BRCA1/2 and requested test is myChoice
CDx), or
◦ Member has a close (1st or 2nd degree) biological relative with a known germline
mutation in a gene that is a target of the requested companion diagnostic test (e.g.
known familial mutation in BRCA1/2 and requested test is myChoice CDx), and the
member’s germline test was negative, AND
• Rendering laboratory is a qualified provider of service per the Health Plan policy.
Note:
Not all indications for medications with an FDA-approved companion diagnostic liquid
biopsy test require the results of that test prior to prescribing. Testing would not be

Lab Management GuidelinesV2.0.2025
considered medically necessary when prescribed for indications that do not require the
companion diagnostic.
Guardant360 LDT
When Guardant360 LDT (laboratory developed test) is being requested for indications
that are outside the scope of a companion diagnostic (i.e.: non-CDx), the panel will be
considered medically necessary when the following criteria are met:
• The member has a diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent non-small cell lung cancer
(NSCLC), AND
• NSCLC diagnosis has been confirmed based on a histopathologic assessment of
tumor tissue, AND
• No previous multi-gene panel testing has been performed for NSCLC, AND
• Insufficient tumor tissue is available for broad molecular profiling and member is
unable to undergo an additional standard tissue biopsy due to documented medical
reasons (i.e., invasive tissue sampling is contraindicated due to the member’s clinical
condition)
ESR1 Liquid Biopsy Test
• The member has a diagnosis of metastatic or recurrent hormone receptor positive
(ER+ or PR+) and human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) negative breast
cancer, AND
• The member's cancer has progressed following endocrine therapy, AND
• Breast cancer diagnosis has been confirmed based on a histopathologic assessment
of tumor tissue, AND
• No previous testing has identified a somatic ESR1 mutation*, AND
• Rendering laboratory is a qualified provider of service per the Health Plan policy.
Note:
Repeat testing may be warranted for individuals with ESR1 wild-type results from prior
somatic testing whose cancer has progressed following treatment.
Other Non-CDx Liquid Biopsy Tests and Tests for Other Indications
These tests are considered Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven.
• Experimental, Investigational, or Unproven (E/I/U) refers to tests, or uses of tests, that
have insufficient data to demonstrate an overall health benefit. This typically means
there is insufficient data to support that a test accurately assesses the outcome of
interest (analytical and clinical validity) and significantly improves patient health
outcomes (clinical utility). Such tests are also not generally accepted as the standard
of care in the evaluation or management of a particular condition.

• In the case of laboratory testing, FDA approval or clearance is not a reliable
standard given the number of laboratory developed tests that currently fall outside
of FDA oversight. In addition, FDA approval or clearance often does not include an
assessment of clinical utility.
Billing and Reimbursement
Introduction
This section outlines the billing requirements for tests addressed in this guideline. These
requirements will be enforced during the case review process whenever appropriate.
Examples of requirements may include specific coding scenarios, limits on allowable
test combinations or frequency and/or information that must be provided on a claim for
automated processing. Any claims submitted without the necessary information to allow
for automated processing (e.g. ICD code, place of service, etc.) will not be reimbursable
as billed. Any claim may require submission of medical records for post service review.
When otherwise reimbursable, the following will apply:
• When a panel is being performed, it is only reimbursable when billed with a single,
appropriate panel procedure code (e.g., 81462, 81463, 81464*).
Note:
*The panel code(s) listed here may not be all-inclusive. For further discussion of what is
considered an appropriate panel code, please refer to the guideline Laboratory Billing
and Reimbursement.
What is liquid biopsy testing?
The use of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) to identify genetic mutations present in a
tumor is also referred to as a liquid biopsy.
• The National Cancer Institute defines a liquid biopsy as "[a] laboratory test done on
a sample of blood, urine, or other body fluid to look for cancer cells from a tumor or
small pieces of DNA, RNA, or other molecules released by tumor cells into a person's
body fluids. Liquid biopsy allows multiple samples to be taken over time, which may
help doctors understand what kind of genetic or molecular changes that are taking
place in a tumor."
1
• Circulating tumor DNA is released into circulation by tumors.
2 
It can be found in
various substances, including blood, urine, saliva, etc.

Lab Management GuidelinesV2.0.2025
• Analysis of ctDNA can be performed to help identify indicators of disease recurrence
or disease progression. It can also help to determine if a specific treatment is
indicated.
• Liquid biopsies can be used to more easily obtain serial sampling of a tumor. This
is particularly useful since somatic mutations that are used in treatment decisions
can change as the tumor progresses.
2
 ctDNA is also thought to provide a more
representative sample of the entire tumor genome as well as any metastases that
may be present.
2
• Traditional methods of performing biopsies on tumor tissue pose the following
problems:
2,3
◦ Biopsies are invasive, involve risks, are typically costly, and are typically difficult to
obtain.
◦ Treatment decisions often rely on one single biopsy, while tumors are usually
heterogeneous in nature, tumor characteristics can evolve, and information
regarding metastases may not be known.
2
• The use of liquid biopsies can help overcome some of the above problems with
traditional biopsies since they can be completed in a noninvasive manner.
• This guideline will only address the use of ctDNA as a liquid biopsy in solid tumors
and hematologic malignancies. Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) can be used to help
obtain information about an individual's cancer prognosis and treatment options. CTC
assays are not addressed by this guideline.
Test information
Introduction
Liquid biopsy testing is an assay that utilizes ctDNA to assist with monitoring disease
status and potentially determining sensitivity to certain treatments.
Liquid biopsy methodology
Testing methodology relies on the presence of ctDNA in circulation, which is typically
analyzed by one of the following methods:
• Standard testing methodologies, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) or
sequencing, are used to identify targeted mutations commonly present in tumors of a
specific type.
• Methodologies such as next-generation sequencing (NGS) or array comparative
genomic hybridization (aCGH) are used to identify both novel and recurrent
mutations. These include whole genome sequencing or whole exome sequencing.
These approaches analyze single genes, panels of genes, exomes, or genomes. Use

Lab Management GuidelinesV2.0.2025
of these approaches allows testing with no prior knowledge of genetic mutations that
are present in the individual's tumor.
• Several liquid biopsy tests have been designated by the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) as companion diagnostic (CDx) assays deemed necessary
for the effective use of a specific medication in the context of a specific clinical
indication. Within this guideline, liquid biopsy tests that do not have the designation of
companion diagnostics are referred to as non-CDx assays.
Note:
Tests that extract DNA from nucleated cells in the blood or bone marrow for hematologic
malignancies are not considered liquid biopsies. For information on these assays,
please refer to the guideline Somatic Mutation Testing, as this testing is not addressed
here.
Guidelines and evidence
American Society of Clinical Oncology
A rapid recommendation on testing to guide therapy for metastatic breast cancer
from the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO, 2023) included the following
statement:
4
• "To aid in treatment selection, the Expert Panel recommends routine testing for
emergence of ESR1 mutations at recurrence or progression on [endocrine treatment]
(given with or without CDK4/6 inhibitor) in patients with ER-positive, HER2-negative
MBC. Testing with a Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments-certified assay
should be performed on blood or tissue obtained at the time of progression, as
ESR1 mutations develop in response to selection pressure during treatment and are
typically undetectable in the primary tumor. Blood-based ctDNA is preferred owing to
greater sensitivity. If not performed earlier, testing for PIK3CA mutations should also
be performed to guide further therapy. Patients whose tumor or ctDNA tests remain
ESR1 wild-type may warrant retesting at subsequent progression(s) to determine
if an ESR1 mutation has arisen (Type: Evidence-based, benefits outweigh harms;
Evidence quality: High; Strength of recommendation: Strong)."
A provisional clinical opinion for somatic genomic testing in individuals with metastatic or
advanced cancer (ASCO, 2022) stated:
5
• "There is a growing body of evidence on the clinical utility of genomic testing on
cfDNA [cell-free DNA] in the plasma, so-called liquid biopsies. Studies have shown
substantial concordance between cfDNA-based testing and tumor testing, with the
caveat that copy-number changes may be more difficult to assess in cfDNA, and
fusion testing may be more limited in common cfDNA tests used currently. However,

Lab Management GuidelinesV2.0.2025
cfDNA has the advantage of being noninvasive and expediting testing because of
the lack of need to retrieve archival blocks or arrange for a new biopsy. There are
already FDA approvals on the basis of cfDNA-based genomic testing (eg, osimertinib
for EGFR T790M mutation in lung cancer). Therefore, in patients without tissue-based
genomic test results, treatment may be based on actionable alterations identified in
cfDNA. Genomic testing on cfDNA is most helpful when genomic testing is indicated,
archival tissue is unavailable, and new tumor biopsies are not feasible. cfDNA is more
commonly reported with mutant allelic fractions of individual mutations, compared
with solid tumor panels, thus facilitating assessment of clonality. cfDNA testing has
the additional advantage of capturing tumor heterogeneity because of pooling in the
blood of DNA from throughout the tumor or from multiple tumors and is a promising
tool for assessing genomic mechanisms of acquired resistance. Furthermore, cfDNA
levels themselves may be prognostic, and early cfDNA dynamics may serve as an
early predictor of therapy response or resistance. Ongoing studies are expected to
better delineate the clinical utility of serial liquid biopsies."
American Society of Clinical Oncology and College of American Pathologists
Based on a comprehensive systematic review of 77 scientific studies on ctDNA assays
for solid tumors, an expert panel assembled by the American Society of Clinical
Oncology (ASCO, 2018) and the College of American Pathologists (CAP, 2018)
concluded that there is currently insufficient evidence of clinical validity and clinical utility
for most ctDNA assays being used in advanced cancer.
 6 
There are some ctDNA assays
that have demonstrated clinical validity and clinical utility with certain types of cancers,
such as non-small cell lung cancer. There is no evidence for use in early stage cancer,
treatment monitoring, or residual disease detection. They also stated that there is no
evidence of clinical value for cancer screening outside of a clinical trial.
To establish clinical validity and clinical utility of ctDNA analyses, the expert panel
recommended the following:
• “Future research studies to establish clinical validity and utility of ctDNA assays
should include a patient cohort that matches the intended-use population as closely
as possible and samples collected from a prospective study with defined entry
criteria. Data will most frequently come from a phase II or phase III study in the
patient population where it is anticipated the assay would be used in subsequent
clinical practice, with the frequency of the variant under study approximately equal to
that in an unselected clinical population. In prospective studies of targeted therapies,
the entry criteria should allow inclusion of patients in which the variant under study
is observed in the plasma, but not in the tissue analysis, to evaluate the treatment
response of this population with discordant genotyping results."

Lab Management GuidelinesV2.0.2025
European Society for Medical Oncology
The European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO, 2022) stated the following
regarding liquid biopsies (LBs) for testing in individuals with advanced cancer:
7
• "LB assays with very high analytical and clinical specificity, and therefore positive
predictive values, may be used in routine practice when the results will affect
standard treatment options. The limitations of ctDNA assays, however, must be taken
into account."
• "...the clinical utility of ctDNA is very much context-dependent, contingent on disease
types and stages, available treatment that could effectively eradicate MRD [minimal
residual disease] and intended use..."
• Tissue-based testing is the most appropriate test for the majority of individuals, while
clinical scenarios exist where ctDNA assays are recommended. These include certain
aggressive tumors or when tumor tissue is insufficient or not appropriate.
The guidelines also stated that insufficient evidence exists for implementing use of
ctDNA assays for cancer screening, monitoring of treatment response, or detection of
molecular relapse or MRD.
International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer
A consensus statement from the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer
(IASLC, 2021) on usage of liquid biopsy for advanced NSCLC made the following
recommendations:
8
• For treatment-naive individuals with advanced NSCLC, tumor genotyping with a
tissue sample should be performed first if available. If the tumor tissue is of uncertain
adequacy or there is concern for incomplete tumor genotyping, ctDNA genotyping can
be performed concurrently or as reflex testing. When a tissue sample is unavailable
for these individuals, plasma ctDNA genotyping is the recommended test.
• Usage of plasma ctDNA is recommended "[a]t the time of acquired resistance after
tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy in an oncogene-driven NSCLC."
National Comprehensive Cancer Network
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, 2025) stated the following
regarding liquid biopsies for testing in individuals with non-small cell lung cancer:
9
• "ctDNA testing should not be used in lieu of a histologic tissue diagnosis."
• "ctDNA is not routinely recommended in settings other than advanced/metastatic
disease. For stages I-III, tissue-based testing is preferred. Metastatic disease
confined to the thorax may have a higher yield with tissue-based testing."
• "Studies have demonstrated ctDNA and tissue testing to have very high specificity.
Both ctDNA and tissue testing have appreciable false-negative rates, supporting the
complementarity of these approaches, and data support complementary testing to
reduce turnaround time and increase yield of targetable alteration detection."

Lab Management GuidelinesV2.0.2025
• "...the panel feels that plasma ctDNA testing should not be used to diagnose NSCLC;
tissue should be used to diagnose NSCLC. Standards and guidelines for plasma
ctDNA testing for somatic variants/mutations have not been published, there is up to
a 30% false-negative rate, and variants can be detected that are not related to the
tumor....careful consideration is required to determine whether ctDNA findings reflect
a true oncogenic driver or an unrelated finding."
• "...plasma ctDNA testing can be used in specific circumstances if 1) the patient is not
medically fit for invasive tissue sampling; or 2) there is insufficient tissue for molecular
analysis and follow-up tissue-based analysis will be done if an oncogenic driver is
not identified. Data suggest that plasma ctDNA testing is a useful minimally invasive
test that can be used to identify ALK, BRAF, EGFR, HER2, MET exon 14 skipping,
RET, ROS1, and other oncogenic biomarkers that would not otherwise be identified in
patients with metastatic NSCLC."
• "The NCCN Guidelines for NSCLC provide recommendations for individual
biomarkers that should be tested and recommend testing techniques but do not
endorse any specific commercially available biomarker assays or commercial
laboratories."
The National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN, 2024) guidelines for breast
cancer stated that "comprehensive germline and somatic profiling" utilizing tumor
tissue or ctDNA assays should be performed in individuals with recurrent or stage IV
disease.
10
 They also stated that "[t]issue-based assays have greater sensitivity, but
ctDNA may reflect tumor heterogeneity more accurately." This guideline does state that
liquid biopsy is the preferred methodology for the identification of ESR1 mutations in
individuals with hormone receptor positive/HER2 negative recurrent unresectable or
stage IV breast cancer.
Selected Relevant Publications
Many laboratories are developing liquid biopsy assays. For many of these assays,
analytical validity studies have been performed; however, data regarding the clinical
validity and clinical utility of these tests is still emerging.
3,11-51
The TRACERx study (Tracking Non-small cell lung cancer evolution through therapy
(Rx)) is a large, prospective clinical trial being conducted to evaluate "the relationship
between intra-tumour heterogeneity and clinical outcome following surgery and adjuvant
therapy."
52
 Researchers plan to analyze the individual's tumors before surgery and
multiple times after surgery during their treatment regimen. Tumor tissue and ctDNA in
individual's blood will be examined in approximately 840 individuals with NSCLC. This
trial is expected to continue until 2026.
52
Limited evidence suggests that liquid biopsy with Guardant360, in individuals with
advanced NSCLC, may be a reasonable non-invasive alternative to tumor biopsy,

particularly in individuals unable to undergo standard tissue biopsy or in cases where
tumor tissues are lacking or insufficient for proper mutation analysis.
53-68
Several systematic reviews and meta-analyses have synthesized the findings of multiple
studies to evaluate the clinical validity and clinical utility of cell-free circulating tumor
DNA (ctDNA) to detect a variety of advanced cancer (excluding non-small cell lung
cancer and hematological malignancies).
6,11-15,19-43,69-72
 With the exception of FDA-
approved ctDNA assays, the majority of assays have limited evidence of clinical validity
and very limited-to-no evidence of clinical utility for use in individuals with advanced
cancer.
6 
Some studies have also reported relatively high rates of discordance between
ctDNA assays and tissue-based testing. There is even less evidence regarding the
validity of ctDNA testing in early stage disease, during treatment monitoring, or minimal
residual disease (MRD) detection.
6
 Additional well-designed prospective studies are
needed to establish the clinical validity and clinical utility of ctDNA assays before ctDNA
assays (liquid biopsy) can be widely adopted in clinical practice.
Note:
This benefit/harm statement only applies to those jurisdictions that do not have Medicare
guidance. Based upon the guidelines and evidence provided in the clinical policy,
following EviCore's criteria for liquid biopsy testing will ensure that testing will be
available to those members most likely to benefit from the information provided by the
assays. For those not meeting criteria, it ensures alternate diagnostic/management
strategies are considered. However, it is possible that some members who would benefit
from the testing, but do not meet clinical criteria, will not receive an immediate approval
for testing.
