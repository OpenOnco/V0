Definitions 
 
Comparative Genome Hybridization (CGH): CGH is a technology that can be used to detect genomic copy number 
variations (CNVs). Tests can use a variety of probes or single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPS) to provide copy number 
and gene differentiating information. All platforms share that tumor (patient), and reference DNA are labeled with dyes or 
fluorescing probes and hybridized on the array, and a scanner measures differences in intensity between the probes, and 
the data is expressed as having greater or less intensity than the reference DNA (Cooley et al., 2013). 
 
Comprehensive Genomic Profiling (CGP): A type of next-generation sequencing test that is able to detect all classes of 
genomic alterations, including cancer biomarkers, with a single sample (Singh et al., 2020). 
 
Favorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Clinical/pathological features must include all of the following: No high- 
or very high-risk group features, Grade Group 1 or 2, less than 50% of biopsy cores are positive (e.g., < 6 of 12 cores) 
and has one intermediate risk factor (T2b-T2c, PSA 10-20 ng/mL, Grade Group 2 or 3) (NCCN Prostate Cancer, v1.2025). 
 
Gene Expression Profiling (GEP): A laboratory test that analyzes messenger RNA (mRNA) patterns to determine gene 
activity (Kim et al., 2010). Also referred to as gene expression testing, gene expression classifier testing or gene 
expression assay. 
 
High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Clinical/pathological features must include all of the following: Does not meet criteria for very 
high risk but has one or more of the following high-risk features: T3-cT4, Grade Group 4 or 5, PSA greater than 20 ng/mL 
(NCCN Prostate Cancer, v1.2025). 
 
Liquid Biopsy: Testing performed on a sample of bodily fluid to identify cancer cells from a tumor or pieces of DNA, RNA 
or other molecules that have been released from tumor cells and are circulating in an individual’s body fluids. Liquid 
Biopsy may be used for early detection of cancer, to help identify effective treatments or to monitor for return of cancer 
[National Cancer Institute (NCI), Liquid Biopsy, 2023]. 
 
Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Clinical/pathological features must include all of the following, but cancer does not qualify for 
very low-risk: PSA is less than 10 ng/mL, Grade Group 1, and T1-T2a disease (NCCN Prostate Cancer, v1.2025). 
 
Measurable Residual Disease (MRD): Also known as minimal residual disease, MRD is a term used to describe a very 
small number of cancer cells or cell contents detectable in the body during and after cancer treatment, even though the 
affected individual may have no signs or symptoms of disease. These cells or genetic material are not detectable through 
routine screening techniques or cellular morphology assessment. Residual evidence of cancer in the body of an individual 
that has undergone cancer treatment can be associated with earlier relapse or recurrence of disease. MRD measurement 
is most often used for blood cancers and can help providers form treatment plans and determine if the treatment is 
effective. Current assessments of MRD use real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (PCR), multiparametric flow 
cytometry and/or NGS [National Cancer Institute (NCI) Dictionary of Cancer Terms, 2024; Yu et al., 2023]. 
 
Next Generation Sequencing (NGS): New sequencing techniques that can quickly analyze multiple sections of DNA at 
the same time. Older forms of sequencing could only analyze one section of DNA at once (Kamps et al., 2017). 
 
Unfavorable Intermediate-Risk Prostate Cancer: Clinical/pathological features must include: No high- or very high-risk 
group features and one or more of the following: Grade Group 3, at least 50% biopsy cores are positive (e.g., ≥ 6 of 12 
cores), and 2 or 3 intermediate risk factors (T2b-T2c disease, Grade Group 2 or 3, PSA 10-20 ng/mL) (NCCN Prostate 
Cancer, v1.2025). 
 
Very High-Risk Prostate Cancer: Clinical/pathological features must include at least two of the following:, T3-T4 
disease, Grade Group 4 or 5, and PSA greater than 40 ng/mL (NCCN Prostate Cancer, v1.2025). 
 
Very Low-Risk Prostate Cancer: Clinical/pathological features must include all of the following: PSA is less than 10 
ng/mL, Grade Group 1, less than 3 biopsy fragments/cores positive with no more than 50% cancer in each core, T1c 
disease and PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/g (NCCN Prostate Cancer, v1.2025). 
 
Whole Exome Sequencing (WES): About 1% of a person’s DNA makes protein. These protein-making sections are 
called exons. All the exons together are called the exome. WES is a DNA analysis technique that looks at all the exons in 
a person, or a tissue type such as a tumor, at one time, rather than gene by gene (MedlinePlus, 2021).

Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS): WGS determines the sequence of the entire DNA in a person, or a tissue type, 
such as a tumor, which includes the protein-making (coding) as well as non-coding DNA elements (MedlinePlus, 2021).

Description of Services 
 
Technologies used for molecular profiling of solid tumor cancers vary and can include but are not limited to tests that 
evaluate variations in the genes, such as chromosome microarray analysis and Next Generation Sequencing, as well as 
others that assess the gene products, such as gene expression arrays and microRNA analysis. The amount of genetic 
material evaluated can range from a single gene to the Whole Exome or Genome of a tumor. For the purposes of this 
policy, multi-gene analysis generally refers to a gene panel containing five or more genes, though some exceptions may 
apply as noted specifically in the policy. In some tests, expression patterns of certain genes are combined in a defined 
manner to provide an expression signature, a score, or a classifier for potential diagnosis and or prognosis of disease or 
to predict impact of intervention. Results of molecular profiling may assist individuals and healthcare providers with 
determining prognosis and selection of more effective and targeted cancer therapies (Chantrill et al., 2015). 
 
Clinical Evidence 
 
Breast Cancer 
There are many laboratory tests developed to detect genetic variation in breast tumor tissue, particularly gene expression 
tests. These results may be used to predict distant recurrence (DR) risk for women with early-stage breast cancer (BC). In 
turn, this may help with the decision of whether to include adjuvant chemotherapy. 
 
Hyams et al. 2024 conducted an assessment and systematic review of the leading commercially available gene 
expression assays (GEAs) for early-stage BC. The systematic review was intended to build upon prior reviews focusing 
on the following GEAs: Breast Cancer Index (BCI), EndoPredict, MammaPrint, Oncotype DX, and Prosigna, assessing 
each GEA’s utility for prognostication and/or prediction of adjuvant therapy benefit. In all, 1053 articles were identified for 
inclusion in the review and analysis and the Tumor Marker Utility Grading System (TMUGS) was used to analyze the level 
of evidence (LOE) of studies identified. After review of the dataset, the authors concluded that the five widely 
commercialized assays all have some high‐level evidence supporting prognostic capability in varying patient subsets. 
Most of the tests were validated initially via “prospective-retrospective” studies which confirmed their competency for 
prognostication with high LOE. Several of the GEAs identify low‐risk individuals for whom adjuvant chemotherapy is 
difficult to justify. Two assays (MammaPrint and Oncotype DX) identify those who might avoid even endocrine therapy

(ET), although current data remain preliminary. Some of the assays provide late prognostic information that could impact 
the selection of extended endocrine therapy (EET). The most commonly used test in this setting, BCI, appears to be 
predictive of response to anti‐estrogens. Despite this, several of the GEAs remain unvalidated in certain sub-populations 
based on menopausal and lymph node status. Of the GEAs assessed in this review, just two (MammaPrint and Oncotype 
DX) have been the focus of large, prospective clinical trials and only Oncotype DX has a high LOE supporting its ability to 
predict the benefit of adjuvant chemotherapy. Two of three prospective trials of the Oncotype DX assay identified a 
relationship between chemotherapy benefit and age and/or menopause, underscoring the importance of large, high-
quality trials in enhancing clinical care for individuals with BC. Overall, the reviewers assert that the abundance of recent 
data focused on the five most well-known commercial GEAs has provided a basis for comprehensive evaluation of each 
of the assays and their ability to deliver clinically applicable prognostic and/or predictive information. 
 
In 2022, Griguolo et al. explored the evidence on the most widely used, commercially available gene-expression 
signatures (Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, PAM50, EndoPredict, and BCI) for individuals receiving neoadjuvant therapy for 
hormone receptor-positive/human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-negative BC (HR+/HER2- BC). The authors 
evaluated the data for the association of gene expression signatures and responses to neoadjuvant chemotherapy (NCT) 
or neoadjuvant endocrine treatment (NET) and the clinical suggestions from the data to guide clinical decision-making in 
early HR+/HER2- BC. A consistent association was observed between higher risk (as per gene expression signatures) 
and higher pathological complete response (pCR) rate after NCT across the GEAs studied. Association between lower 
risk based on gene expression signatures and higher pCR after NET was observed. The evidence, however, is limited 
and based on small retrospective studies. Larger prospective trials are needed to confirm results for the use of GEAs in 
this context. The researchers assert that the potential use of gene expression signatures to assist with selection of 
neoadjuvant therapy (chemotherapy versus endocrine therapy) in early BC merits further exploration. 
 
Harnan and colleagues (2019) conducted a systematic review and economic analysis to determine the efficacy and cost-
effectiveness of the tumor profiling tests Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, Prosigna, EndoPredict, and immunohistochemistry 4 
(IHC4). Studies included individuals with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+), HER2-, stage I or II cancer with zero to three 
positive lymph nodes (LN+). The review included 153 articles on the five tests. In all five tests, the proportions of 
individuals who were lymph node-negative (LN0) getting endocrine monotherapy, 9% to 33%, were categorized as high-
risk, according to the literature. For individuals who were LN+, three tests: Prosigna, EPClin, and IHC4 plus clinical factors 
(IHC4+C), categorized more (38% to 76%) individuals who were LN+ than those who were LN0 as high-risk according to 
the studies of endocrine monotherapy. Oncotype DX categorized high-risk in the LN0 and LN+ subsets as equal. 
Oncotype DX classified more individuals as low-risk in LN+ when compared to other tests (57% in Oncotype DX vs 4% to 
28% in other tests), but worse ten-year DR/relapse-free survival/DR/relapse-free interval outcomes (82% in Oncotype DX 
vs 95% to 100% in other tests). An increase of 1% to a decrease of 23% was seen in United Kingdom (UK) studies and a 
reduction of 0% to 64% across European studies on the net change of individuals who were recommended chemotherapy 
or decision pre/posttest. Limitations included gaps in the literature, the risk of bias, and limited data relating to the ability of 
Oncotype DX and MammaPrint to predict benefits from chemotherapy. Additional long-term studies can show the impacts 
and changes in chemotherapy decisions for Oncotype DX and MammaPrint. The authors concluded that the evidence 
indicates that all the tests deliver prognostic data regarding the risk of relapse, although greater variation was seen in 
individuals with LN+ status than those with LN 0 status. 
 
Oncotype Dx
 
Breast 
Oncotype Dx Breast (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) is a test that analyzes the expression of a panel of 21 genes 
within a tumor to determine a Recurrence Score (RS) which may correspond to a likelihood of BC recurrence within ten 
years. The test was initially developed for women with early-stage invasive BC with early-stage cancers that are LN0, and 
subsequently evidence was gathered on individuals with up to three ipsilateral nodes positive. These individuals are 
typically treated with anti-hormonal therapy, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitors, and Oncotype Dx
®
 can help 
determine if chemotherapy should be added to the treatment regimen (Evaluation of Genomic Applications in Practice and 
Prevention [EGAPP] Working Group, 2016). 
 
Sparano et al. 2024 explored Oncotype DX’s role in providing prognostic information for late DR when added to 
clinicopathologic prognostic factors through a patient-specific meta-analysis. Included in the meta-analysis were 10,004 
women who were enrolled in three trials, which was updated by using the extended follow-up data from the TAILORx trial 
(including integration of the RS with histologic grade, tumor size, and age at surgery for the RSClin tool). Likelihood ratio 
(LR) tests were used to compare Cox models integrating clinicopathologic factors and the RS. In addition, external 
validation of prognosis for DR in years 0 to 10 and 5 to 10 was performed in an independent cohort of 1098 women from a 
real-world registry. The results showed that RSClin delivered substantially more prognostic data than either the 
clinicopathologic factors (ΔLR chi-square, 86.2; p < 0.001) or RS alone (ΔLR chi-square, 131.0; p < 0.001). The model 
was predictive in an independent cohort for DR 10 years after diagnosis (standardized hazard ratio, 1.56; 95% confidence 
interval, 1.25 to 1.94), was associated with late DR risk between five and ten years after diagnosis (standardized hazard

ratio, 1.78; 95% confidence interval, 1.25 to 2.55), and was near the observed ten-year DR risk (Lin concordance, 0.87) 
and five- to ten-year DR risk (Lin concordance, 0.92). The limitations of the analysis included the risk of limited external 
generalizability as it was developed in those who met the inclusion criteria for the associated trials. The authors concluded 
that the 21-gene RS is prognostic for both DR and overall survival (OS) in individuals with early breast cancer (EBC). In 
addition, they suggest that a model integrating the 21-gene RS and an individual’s clinicopathologic factors improved 
estimates of DR risk when compared with either the 21-gene RS or clinicopathological factors used alone, and 
additionally, assists with stratification of late DR risk. 
 
Nash and colleagues (2023) investigated the benefit of chemotherapy based on RS in younger women (aged 40-50) who 
were eligible for oncotype testing. Participants were selected from the National Cancer Database (NCBD) and grouped by 
age, RS, nodal status, and receipt of chemotherapy. A total of 15,422 individuals met inclusion criteria for the study. Of 
these 43.5% received chemotherapy. Log-rank tests were used to assess for differences between groups and Kaplan-
Meier curves compared the unadjusted OS between groups. The analysis revealed that individuals who received 
chemotherapy were more likely to have higher-stage and higher-grade tumors, tumors that were PR-negative, and higher 
RS (p < 0.001 for all). RS was prognostic for OS regardless of nodal status. After adjustment, chemotherapy was 
associated with a significant improvement in OS only in the pN1 RS 31-50 subgroup (p = 0.02). The authors concluded 
that RS remains prognostic in younger individuals with early-stage HR-positive, HER2- BC. The survival benefit with 
chemotherapy was only found in those aged 40-50 with pN1 disease and RS of 31-50. As such, chemotherapy decision-
making should be especially preference-sensitive in women aged 40-50 with intermediate RS, where survival benefit may 
not be enhanced for many women. 
 
The 21-gene expression assay (Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score) is commonly and increasingly used to assist with 
decision-making regarding adjuvant chemotherapy in ER+/HER2- BC with one to three positive lymph nodes (N1) 
disease. To evaluate patterns in practice related to the use of the RS for decision-making regarding chemotherapy and 
survival outcomes in these individuals, Li et al. (2023) retrospectively evaluated 35,137 individuals with T1-2N1M0 and 
ER+/HER2- BC from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) Oncotype DX Database. Both breast 
cancer specific survival (BCSS) and OS were included in the assessment. In this study, older age, lower tumor grade, T1 
stage, fewer positive lymph nodes, and progesterone receptor-positive disease (all p < 0.05) were all associated with use 
of the 21-gene test. RS had a significant association with chemotherapy treatment in the group that had the 21-gene test, 
whereas age was the primary factor significantly associated with chemotherapy treatment in the group that did not receive 
21-gene testing. For individuals who underwent 21-gene testing, the probably of chemotherapy was 30.8%; in the group 
who did not undergo the 21-gene test, probably of chemotherapy was higher at 64.1%. Based on multivariate prognostic 
analysis, use of the 21-gene test was associated with both improved BCSS (p < 0.001) and OS (p < 0.001) when 
compared to individuals who did not receive the test. From this data, the authors concluded that the 21-gene assay is 
related to lower rates of adjuvant chemotherapy use and improved survival outcomes. They indicate their support for the 
use of the 21-gene assay in individuals with ER+/HER2- BC with N1 disease. 
 
In a 2022 systematic review and network meta-analysis, Davey et al. evaluated the Oncotype DX 21-gene RS for its 
ability to estimate locoregional recurrence (LRR) in ER+/HER2- BC. The review uncovered 16 articles together with 
21,037 individuals. The average RS was 17.1, and the average follow-up was 66.4 months. Employing standard RS cut-
offs, 49.7% of individuals had RS < 18 (3944/7935), 33.8% had RS 18–30 (2680/7935), and 16.5% had RS > 30 
(1311/7935). Those with RS 18–30 and RS > 30 were significantly more likely to experience LRR than those with RS < 
18. Using the TAILORx cut-off, 16.2% of individuals had RS < 11 (1974/12,208), 65.8% had RS 11–25 (8036/12,208), and 
18.0% with RS > 30 (2198/12,208). LRR rates were comparable for individuals with RS 11–25; however, those with RS > 
25 had a considerable risk of LRR versus those with RS < 11. The authors concluded that RS testing correctly estimates 
the risk of LRR for individuals being treated with the intent to cure early-stage ER+/HER2− BC. RS testing is a valid 
method to measure the risk of distant disease recurrence; however, awareness of its ability to predict LRR is significant to 
create effective locoregional control of the breast and axilla. Future prospective, randomized studies can confirm the 
predictive value of RS for estimating LRR and the application of RS to create suitable locoregional control in high-risk 
cases. 
 
In 2021, Kalinsky et al. published the results of a prospective randomized clinical trial (RCT) to find the effect of 
chemotherapy on invasive disease-free survival in individuals with positive lymph-node disease and determine whether 
the RS based on the 21 gene assay (Oncotype Dx) influenced the outcome. A total of 5018 women with hormone-
receptor-positive, HER2- BC, 1 to 3 positive axillary lymph nodes, and an RS of 25 or lower were randomly grouped into 
an ET alone subset or a chemotherapy with endocrine (chemoendocrine) therapy subset. The intention-to-treat analysis 
included the participants who declined the assigned treatment, with 402 (16.2%) participants allocated to chemoendocrine 
therapy and 144 (5.8%) given to ET. The trial did not show a clinically applicable or statistically significant rise in invasive 
disease-free survival with the addition of adjuvant chemotherapy to ET in the global population with the same 
characteristics. In the 67% of participants who were post-menopausal, no chemotherapy advantage was found, while

adjuvant chemotherapy led to a relative increase of 40% in invasive disease-free survival and a relative increase of 42% 
in distant relapse-free survival (RFS) in premenopausal women. Invasive disease-free survival at five years was 91.9% 
among post-menopausal women in the endocrine-only group and 91.3% in the chemoendocrine group, with no 
chemotherapy advantage. In the group of premenopausal women, invasive disease-free survival at five years was 89.0% 
with endocrine-only therapy and 93.9% with chemoendocrine treatment, with a comparable rise in distant RFS. Per the 
authors, the trial showed that in premenopausal women with one to three positive lymph nodes (N1) and an RS of 25 or 
less, individuals who received chemoendocrine therapy had a lengthier invasive disease-free survival and distant RFS 
than those who received endocrine-only treatment. In contrast, post-menopausal women with the same characteristics did 
not show benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. 
 
Hayes published a Molecular Test Assessment addressing the use of the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score for 
individuals with ER+, HER2-, lymph node positive BC to determine the capability of the test to estimate the risk of DR and 
the predict the likelihood of chemotherapy benefit in 2020. For individuals with N1 disease, limited but consistent evidence 
supports the use of the Oncotype DX test for predicting the risk of nine-year DR, but there is insufficient evidence 
supporting the test’s ability to predict the benefit of chemotherapy. Oncotype DX may improve outcomes for individuals 
with N1 cancer by lessening the total population of individuals treated with chemotherapy, thereby avoiding detrimental 
side effects. Insufficient evidence was found to support the use of Oncotype DX testing for estimating the risk of DR and 
the potential benefit of chemotherapy for individuals with N2 disease (four to nine positive lymph nodes) (Hayes, 
Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score [Genomic Health Inc.] for Lymph Node–Positive Patients, 2020, updated 2023). 
 
In a 2020 Hayes Molecular Test Assessment, the Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score was assessed as a prognostic 
indicator for nine-year distant BC recurrence and predictive indicator for chemotherapy benefit in individuals diagnosed 
with ER+, HER2-, and node-negative (N0) invasive BC. The evidence presented in the assessment suggests that the 
Oncotype DX test can estimate the risk of DR and the likely benefit of chemotherapy for guiding proper treatment 
decisions for individuals, thus impacting provider management and decisions related to therapy. Additional study 
addressing the range of scores necessary for predicting the likelihood of chemotherapy benefits in specific subgroups is 
recommended. Clinical utility studies reporting health outcomes after recurrence score-based treatments are needed as 
well (Hayes, Oncotype DX Breast Recurrence Score for Lymph Node–Negative Patients [Genomic Health Inc.] 2020, 
updated 2023). 
 
Poorvu et al. (2020) evaluated women less than 40 years of age with early-stage ER+ and HER2- BC to decide if the 21-
gene RS could inform chemotherapy recommendations. The prospective TAILORx phase three trial enrolled 509 
individuals, and the RS assay was performed either clinically (189 participants) or on banked specimens (320 individuals). 
The median follow-up time was 6 years. Of the 509 individuals, 300 (59%) had N0 BC and 195 of them had a RS of 11-
25, of which 86 received chemotherapy. The six-year DR free survival (DRFS) varied by the RS with < 11 associated with 
94.4% N0 and 92.3% N1. For those with RS 11-25, DRFS was 96.9% N0 and 85.2% N1 and for those with RS > 26, the 
DRFS was 85.1% N0 and 71.3% N1. The researchers concluded that the assay is prognostic for young women with N0 
and limited N1. 
 
Wang et al. (2019) examined the value of Oncotype Dx when determining the prognosis in female individuals with BC and 
tumor stage 1-2 (tumor is 20-55mm), LN+ and no evidence of metastasis (T1-2
 
N1M0). The study reviewed 4059 cases to 
categorize them to prognostic stages IA and IIB and used data derived from the National Cancer Institute’s limited use 
SEER 18 registry databases, released in November 2017. Cases in the SEER database was linked to RS results from 
assays performed by Genomic Health. All cases with RS had negative HER2, and the authors selected female ER+ 
invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC) cases in T1-2N1M0 stage with Oncotype RS results diagnosed between 2004 and 2012. 
Individuals were categorized into low-risk (RS < 11), intermediate-risk (RS 11–25), and high-risk (RS > 25) groups. The 
median age of the individuals was 59 years. Of these participants, 2898 (71.4%) had stage T1 cancer, 1854 (45.7%) had 
stage N
1mic
 cancer, 743 (18.3%) had grade 3 cancer, and 3746 (92.3%) had positive progesterone receptor (PR) status. 
They were stratified into the RS low-risk group (794, 19.6%), the RS intermediate-risk group (2667, 65.7%), and 598 
(14.7%) were in the RS high-risk group. The high-risk group tended to have younger individuals, larger tumors, a higher 
percentage of grade 3 disease, negative PR, and more advanced cancer staging. They also had more frequent use of 
chemotherapy. Otherwise, the RS groups did not differ much in race, N stage, surgery, or radiation. In terms of 
pathological prognostic stages, there were 2781 individuals (68.5%) in stage IA, 829 (20.4%) in stage IB, 360 (8.9%) in 
IIA, and 89 (2.2%) in IIB. The distributions of clinical and pathological characteristics, including BCSS and OS, were 
compared between RS and pathological staging groups using a variety of statistical analysis. The median follow-up period 
was 57 months. The results showed a statistically significant correlation (p < .001) between the RS groups and 
pathological stage results. In the low and high-risk RS groups, the BCSS and OS were similar between RS and 
pathological staging groups. In the intermediate RS group, however, survival rates differed significantly between RS 
staging and pathological staging. The survival rates were inversely correlated with the escalation of prognostic stages. 
Similar trends were seen in the high-risk group but were not statistically significant. In this retrospective study, RS was an

independent prognosticator for BCSS, and with pathological stage for OS. The authors concluded that Oncotype Dx could 
complement the prognostic staging system in N+ individuals. 
 
Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay (Formerly PAM-50) 
The Prosigna Breast Cancer Prognostic Gene Signature Assay (NanoString Technologies, Seattle, WA) is a prognostic 
BC assay that provides a risk category and numerical score to assess an individual's risk of DR of disease at ten years in 
postmenopausal women with N0 (Stage I or II) or N+ (Stage II), HR+ BC. The Prosigna assay measures expression levels 
of 50 genes using formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) breast tumor tissue diagnosed as invasive breast carcinoma. 
The assay is not intended for individuals with N2 (Gnant et al., 2013; Parker et al., 2009). 
 
Fitzal et al. (2021) conducted a prospective multicenter RCT (The Austrian Breast and Colorectal Cancer Study Group 
[ABCSG] 8) to investigate if the PAM50 based 46-gene assay brings prognostic value for the risk of local recurrence of 
BC. The trial compared five years of adjuvant tamoxifen with sequential therapy involving tamoxifen for two years and 
then anastrozole for three years in postmenopausal women with endocrine receptor-positive early-stage BC. All 
participants were regularly followed up every three months for one year, at six-month intervals over the second and third 
years, and annually afterward. Ribonucleic acid (RNA) was extracted from FFPE blocks from BC excision specimens from 
the ABCSG-8 trial. Participants were distributed randomly to either the group who received five years of tamoxifen (525 
participants) or tamoxifen, followed by anastrozole (509 participants) after surgery group. There were 765 individuals 
(74%) with a low risk of recurrence (ROR) score (< 57). The existing data showed that the PAM50 ROR score and 
intrinsic molecular subtypes could detect a low-risk genomic population in individuals with a clinically minimal risk of local 
recurrence. The PAM50 ROR score is consistently associated with the prospect of disease recurrence. Authors explored 
if the PAM50 test may predict the value of radiotherapy following breast conservation, using a subgroup of 170 women in 
the ABCSG-8 trial who did not have adjuvant radiotherapy. The trial suggested that a PAM50-based assay is helpful as a 
prognostic instrument for local recurrence risk in postmenopausal women with HR+ BC treated with ET; however, it is not 
predictive of the benefit of radiotherapy. The trial is limited by its retrospective nature. The authors concluded that a 
PAM50-based assay brings value for the risk of local recurrence of BC for postmenopausal women with HR+ BC treated 
with ET. 
 
MammaPrint (Also Referred to as the "Amsterdam Signature" or "70-Gene 
Signature") and BluePrint 
MammaPrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands) is a 70-gene expression test to assess BC DR risk. The assay 
analyzes tumor tissue (fresh, frozen or FFPE) for expression of 70 genes assumed to be important in cancer metastasis. 
Based on the test results, MammaPrint may assist individuals considering adjuvant treatments. Individuals are assigned 
either a low-risk or a high-risk for a DR. The risk category may be taken into consideration for treatment options.  
 
BluePrint (Agendia, Amsterdam, The Netherlands), a complementary test to MammaPrint, measures the expression of 80 
genes to classify the tumor as one of three subtypes. The tumor subtype is used to predict future behavior of the cancer, 
long term prognosis and response to systemic therapy. Evidence addressing use of Blueprint in conjunction with 
MammaPrint is insufficient to support clinical utility at this time. 
 
Rastogi et al. (2024) conducted a study to examine MammaPrint for predicting extended letrozole therapy (ELT) benefit in 
those with early-stage BC from the NSABP B-42 trial. To carry out the study, MammaPrint was employed in 1866 
individuals randomly assigned to receive either ELT or a placebo. The primary outcome measure was DR; secondary 
endpoints included disease-free survival (DFS) and BC-free interval (BCFI). Classification of tumors were as follows: 
either MammaPrint high risk (MP-HR), or low risk (MP-LR). Tumors classified as MP-LR tumors were further categorized 
as ultralow risk (MP-UL) or low non-ultralow risk (MP-LNUL). The researchers found no statistically significant difference 
in the advantage of ELT for DR between MP-HR and MP-LR (interaction p = .38). MP-LR tumors (n = 1160) revealed a 
statistically significant ten-year benefit of 3.7% for DR (hazard ratio [HR], 0.43 [95% CI, 0.25 to 0.74]; p = .002), while MP-
HR tumors (n = 706) displayed a nonsignificant 2.4% benefit (HR, 0.65 [95% CI, 0.34 to 1.24]; p = .19). The ten-year ELT 
benefit was significant for DFS (7.8%) and BCFI (7.0%) for MP-LR tumors, while MP-HR tumors did not show significantly 
benefit (interaction DFS: p = .015, BCFI: p = .006). The ten-year ELT benefit was significant and more distinct in MP-
LNUL ( n = 908) tumors: 4.0% for DR, 9.5% for DFS, and 7.9% for BCFI; the benefit in MP-UL (n = 252) tumors was not 
significant: 3% for DR, 1.8% for DFS, and 4.1% for BCFI in an exploratory analysis. The study's limitations included its 
prospective-retrospective design and lack of multiplicity adjustment for secondary and exploratory analyses. The authors 
concluded that the primary hypothesis of the predictive capability of MammaPrint on DR was not verified, but the 
secondary endpoint results indicated that MammaPrint is predictive of ELT response and it detected a subset of people 
with early-stage hormone receptor-positive BC (MP-LR) that showed better outcomes from ELT. These findings could 
expand the clinical utility of MammaPrint beyond just prognostic indication because they provide the initial data suggesting 
that MammaPrint may be predictive of EET benefit. The authors recommend further study incorporating

clinicopathological characteristics to further optimize selection of appropriate individuals for treatment. They suggest that 
the confirmation of the utility of the MammaPrint genomic classifier will allow women in specific categories 
(postmenopausal with HR+ BC) to avoid unneeded treatment while helping to identify individuals who require additional 
adjuvant ET. 
 
Van’t Veer et al. (2024) performed a secondary analysis of the IDEAL randomized clinical trial to establish the utility of 
MammaPrint, a 70-gene expression risk-of-recurrence assay, in the identification of those individuals with EBC in the 
IDEAL trial that could benefit from five years of treatment with letrozole versus two-and-a-half years of the same 
treatment. In this study, the researchers assessed postmenopausal women with HR+ EBC who had been assigned to 
either two-and-a-half or five years of EET. Follow-up assessment occurred ten years after randomization. To carry out the 
analysis, a 70-gene assay was used to classify tumors as high, low, or ultralow risk. After five years of ET, participants 
were randomized to two-and-a-half or five years of EET with letrozole. The primary endpoint was DR; Cox proportional 
hazard regression models and likelihood ratios were used to analyze the interaction between treatment and GEA. 
Adverse event (AE) incidence and treatment compliance were also measured. Of the 515 women included (mean [SD] 
age at randomization, 59.9 [9.5] years), 265 were in the two-and-a-half-year treatment arm and 250 were in the five-year 
treatment arm. A total of, 223 (43.3%) of those with 70-gene assay-classified low-risk tumors had a significant absolute 
benefit of 10.1% for DR (HR, 0.32; 95% CI, 0.12-0.87; p = .03). Treatment interaction was not significant for DR. Of those 
with either 70-gene assay–classified high-risk tumors (259 [50.3%]) or ultralow-risk tumors (33 [6.4%]), five years vs two-
and-a-half years of EET had no statistical association with improved benefit for DR. The rate of AEs and treatment 
discontinuation rates were similar among the different 70-gene assay risk groups in each treatment arm. The study was 
limited by its retrospective design and the inclusion of a subset of individuals due to limited tissue sample availability, 
which prevented analyses to be adjusted for covariates. In addition, the study participants were of limited racial diversity, 
only individuals who were postmenopausal were included, and the sample size for the ultralow risk group was small. 
Lastly, non-significant treatment by risk interactions were observed for DR and BCFI, potentially due to low event rates 
seen in the translational cohort. The authors concluded that MammaPrint was able to detect individuals with low-risk 
tumors who may benefit from five year vs two and a half year EET, suggesting that this 70-gene expression-risk-of-
recurrence assay may have utility beyond guiding neoadjuvant and adjuvant chemotherapy decisions; it may have value 
for information treatment decisions regarding adjuvant endocrine therapy as well. They suggest additional study of 
MammaPrint for use as a biomarker to determine EET benefit, specifically focusing on populations including 
premenopausal women. 
 
Marin-Liebana et al. published an initial analysis from the DETERMIND study in 2023. DETERMIND is a prospective, 
open-label, multicenter study evaluating the utility of the MammaPrint/BluePrint (MP/BP) signature related to determining 
optimal therapy for individuals with operable, clinically high-risk HR+/HER2- EBC, stage II-IIIA (up to N1) who have 
received a recommendation for NCT. One hundred sixty-five individuals from 11 centers have been included in this 
analysis, with data collected at baseline, at the time of MP/BP results and finally at one- and three-year follow-ups. The 
first analysis incorporated 99 participants with a median age of 57 years (range 31-85). Ninety-four percent of these were 
stage II, with 51% cN1. At the time of MP/BP, 37 individuals (37%) were classified as Luminal A, 58 (59%) were Luminal-
B, and four presented as a non-Luminal phenotype (3 Basal, 1 HER2). Corresponding with MP/BP results, 44 pts did not 
receive NCT. In the MP/BP Luminal A group, 35 (95%) did not receive NCT; for 19 of these individuals, it was replaced by 
NET. Individuals with MP High-Risk results received NCT in 53 cases (85%). MP/BP results significantly increased 
confidence on the final treatment decision made collaboratively by the treating physicians and participants. The authors 
concluded that in individuals with clinical high-risk HR+/HER2- EBC, there is a high frequency (35%) of MP/BP Luminal A, 
who were able to de-escalate NCT. The use of MP/BP also bolstered the decision to administer NCT in the majority (85%) 
of those with MP High Risk. The authors assert that these findings support the utility of MP/BP in high clinical risk 
HR+/HER2- EBC to inform neoadjuvant therapy decisions and increase confidence in clinicians and their patients during 
shared-decision making. The study was sponsored by Agendia, the manufacturer of the MP/BP test, which presents 
potential bias. Larger, high-quality prospective trials are needed to further validate these findings. 
 
Pellicane et al. (2022) addressed the need for reliable biomarkers to identify individuals with HR+ HER2- BC tumors who 
are likely to receive benefit from neoadjuvant endocrine therapy (NET) in a recent observational registry trial of 1091 
individuals with early-stage BC. Participants, who were scheduled to receive neoadjuvant therapy, were prospectively 
enrolled into the Neoadjuvant Breast Registry Symphony Trial (NBRST), sponsored by Agendia. NBRST compared the 
prognostic value of the 70-gene risk classifier (MammaPrint) and the 80-gene molecular subtyping signatures (BluePrint) 
with standard pathological classification methods in response to neoadjuvant treatment. The association of these 
signatures with clinical response and five-year outcome of participants who underwent treatment with NET (n = 67) were 
evaluated in a sub-analysis. Standard of care genomic testing with MammaPrint and BluePrint was performed, and 
participants underwent therapy with NET per their physician’s discretion. Primary outcome was pathologic partial 
response (pPR). Secondary outcomes included distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS) and OS. The researchers defined 
clinical benefit as a pPR or stable disease (SD) with use of NET. Of individuals with genomically Luminal A-Type tumors,

94.4% displayed clinical benefit (50.0%pPR and 44.4% SD). Ninety-five percent of individuals with Luminal B-Type tumors 
exhibited benefit (55.0% pPR and 40.0% SD). At 5-year assessment, individuals with genomically Luminal B tumors had 
substantially worse DMFS (75.6%, 95% CI 50.8 - 89.1) than those with genomically Luminal A tumors (91.1%; 95% CI 
74.8–97.1; p = 0.047). The trend for OS was similar, but was not significant (81.0%, 95% CI 56.9–92.4 and 91.1%, 95% 
CI 74.8–97.1, respectively; p = 0.13). The authors concluded that individuals with 70-gene signature low risk results and 
genomically Luminal A tumors who were treated with ET alone have excellent outcomes at 5 years. In addition, most 
individuals with genomically-defined Luminal A- and B-type tumors respond well to NET, which suggests NET may be a 
safe option for treatment; however, those with genomically Luminal B tumors will also need post-operative chemotherapy 
or CDK4/6 inhibitors to improve their long-term outcomes. The researchers indicate that genomic classification (defined by 
the combined use of 70- and 80- gene signatures) is prognostic of long-term outcomes and is related to tumor response, 
supporting the use of these tests in making neoadjuvant treatment decisions in individuals with early-state HR+ HER2- 
BC. This study was observational and the number of individuals receiving NET was limited, so the sample size was small 
and prevented further subgroup analyses. In addition, NBRST participants receiving NET instead of NCT despite features 
associated with high clinical risk were more likely to be older and postmenopausal. Larger, prospective trials, such as the 
ongoing FLEX trial (NCT030631983), are needed to confirm the findings of this study. 
 
In 2022, Vliek and colleagues published a ten-year follow-up of the observational RASTER study. The prospective 
RASTER study assessed the tumors of 427 individuals with cTanyN0M0 BC. The study aimed to decide the 70-gene 
signature (MammaPrint)’s ability to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for individuals with ER+ and HER2- BC. The 
authors evaluated 310 of the 427 individuals at ten years of follow-up. Of the clinically high-risk individuals, 45 (49%) were 
classified as genomically low-risk. In this subcategory, at ten years, distant recurrence-free interval (DRFI) was 
comparable among individuals treated with (95.7% [95% CI 87.7–100]) and without (95.5% [95% CI 87.1–100]) 
chemotherapy. In the group of clinically low-risk individuals, 56 (26%) were classified as genomically high-risk. For the 
clinically low-risk group, a variance was seen among the genomically high- and low-risk subgroup after five years, 
resulting in a ten-year DRFI of 84.3% (95% CI 74.8–95.0) and 93.4% (95% CI 89.5–97.5), respectively. Genomic ultralow-
risk individuals’ outcomes were a ten-year DRFI of 96.7% (95% CI 90.5–100), primarily (79%) without systemic therapy. 
Limitations to the RASTER study include the observational nature and the risk of bias. The authors concluded that over 
ten years, individuals with clinically high-risk, genomic low-risk tumors have excellent results irrespective of the use of 
chemotherapy. The updated outcomes of the MINDACT trial and RASTER study collectively demonstrate that the data 
supports the use of the MammaPrint in ER+, HER2-, and N0, clinically high-risk individuals with BC. 
 
In NBREaST II, a prospective, neoadjuvant study, Göker et al. (2022) measured the treatment response and five-year 
survival outcome in the molecular subgroups by combining the MammaPrint and BluePrint. MammaPrint and BluePrint 
were carried out on 256 individual core needle biopsies (CNB) to quantify chemosensitivity or endocrine sensitivity in the 
molecular subgroups. The outcomes measured were DMFS, RFS, and BCSS at long-term follow-up. In the group of 
individuals who received NCT (n = 234), MammaPrint and BluePrint categorized 50 tumors as Luminal A-Type (21%), 110 
as Luminal B-Type (47%), 27 as HER2-Type (12%), 47 as Basal-Type (20%). Of individuals that attained a pCR in 
response to NCT (n = 47), 4% had a MammaPrint Low-Risk result, and 96% had a High-Risk outcome. All BluePrint-
defined HER2-Type and Basal-Type tumors had a High-Risk MammaPrint outcome. At five years, DMFS was significantly 
lower (p = 0.039) in MammaPrint High-Risk tumors (83.8%; 95% CI 77.4–88.6) versus MammaPrint Low-Risk tumors 
(91.4%; 95% CI 78.6–96.7). Similar outcomes were seen for five-year RFS; however, not for BCSS. Limitations to the 
study include a small sample size, with no differences in five-year survival when stratifying the cohort into subgroups. The 
study confirms previous conclusions signifying that MammaPrint and BluePrint can predict chemosensitivity and five-year 
results more precisely versus traditional pathological sub-typing, supporting informed decision-making. 
 
Crozier et al. (2022) prospectively collected 139 matched CNB and surgical resection (SR) specimens from women with 
established EBC registered in the ongoing FLEX study (NCT03053193). The goal was to decide the concordance of 
MammaPrint and BluePrint results among CNB and SR to safeguard reliable prognostic information that can be 
apprehended from a CNB. FLEX is an ongoing, multi-institutional prospective study of individuals with Stage I–III EBC. 
Overall, 121 individuals from the FLEX study database with diagnostic MammaPrint and BluePrint results with matched 
CNB and SR specimens were involved in the study. In total, 50 individuals had High-Risk CNB and SR specimens, and 60 
had Low-Risk CNB and SR specimens, resulting in 90.9% total agreement (κ = 0.817), 95.2% negative predictive value 
(NPV), and 86.2% positive predictive value (PPV). The authors concluded the concordance of BluePrint between CNB 
and SR to be 98.3%. For more than 97% of individuals in this study, treatment decisions and probable outcomes are 
precise and consistent based on MammaPrint testing of the CNB. According to the authors, this analysis is the most 
extensive powered study using prospective real‐world numbers to assess the concordance of a genomic assay on 
matched CNB and SR samples. The limitation of the study is the lack of data maturity, as individual follow-up data is not 
available to correlate outcomes with MammaPrint and BluePrint results from the CNB and SR samples. The authors

the value of these assays to acquire reliable prognostic data on core biopsy tissue, which can guide prompt and proper 
treatment decisions. 
 
In 2021, Piccart et al. produced updated results the MINDACT trial, including long-term follow-up with an exploratory 
analysis by age. MINDACT was a randomized, phase three, multicenter trial conducted in 112 academic and community 
hospitals in nine countries that enrolled individuals that had confirmed primary invasive BC with N1, no distant 
metastases, and a WHO performance status of 0-1, and their genomic risk was decided using the MammaPrint 70-gene 
signature. Enrolled in the trial were 6693 individuals with a mean follow-up of 8.7 years. The eight-year estimates for 
DMFS in the intention-to-treat population were 92.0% (95% CI 89.6–93.8) for chemotherapy set against 89.4% who 
received no chemotherapy. The eight-year DMFS in the exploratory analysis by nodal status in these individuals was 
91.7% (95% CI 88.1–94.3) with chemotherapy and 89.2% (85.2–92.2) without chemotherapy in 699 N0 individuals 
(absolute difference 2.5 percentage points [SE 2.3, 95% CI −2.1 to 7.2] and 91.2% (87.2–94.0) as opposed to 89.9% 
(85.8–92.8) for 658 individuals with N1. The exploratory analysis conducted to determine the effects of chemotherapy 
administration on eight-year DMFS according to age resulted in 93.6% with chemotherapy set against 88.6% without 
chemotherapy in 464 women aged 50 years or younger and 90.2% vs 90.0% in 894 women older than 50 years. This 
long-term follow-up of phase three randomized MINDACT trial showed the 70-gene signature’s capability of detecting 
women with high clinical risk, a subgroup, and specific individuals with low genomic risk, with an exceptional DMFS when 
treated with ET by itself. For this group of women, the size of the profit from adding chemotherapy to ET continues to be 
small and is not improved by nodal positivity. The benefit is age-dependent and is solely seen in women under 50; further 
study is needed in younger women, who may need reinforced ET to forego chemotherapy. The authors concluded that 
MammaPrint ought to be a portion of informed, shared decision-making. 
 
Soliman et al. (2020) conducted a prospective case-only trial (IMPACt) enrolling 452 individuals with state I-II, HR+, 
HER2- BC to evaluate the variation in treatment decision and physician assurance based on the 70-gene ROR signature 
and the 80-gene molecular subtype signature (80-GS, BluePrint) in early-stage BC. According to clinical risk assessment 
via the MINDACT criteria, 63.4% (n = 227/358) of individuals were categorized as low-risk, and 36.6% (n = 131/358) of 
individuals were classed as high-risk of DR. For individuals with clinically minimal risk, 77.5% (176/227) were suggested 
not to have chemotherapy by their doctors, while 62.6% (82/131) of individuals with clinically high-risk were recommended 
treatment plans that involved chemotherapy. The 70-GS categorized 62.5% (n = 224/358) of individuals as low-risk and 
37.5% (n = 134/358) as high-risk. Following the 70-GS results, doctors elected to change the chemotherapy treatment 
(CT) recommendation in 24.0% (n = 86/358) of all cases. After-70-GS treatment plans were, 88.5% (n = 317/358) 
agreeing with 70-GS results, 83.6% (n = 112/134) for CT in 70-GS high-risk individuals, 91.5% ( n = 205/224) for no CT in 
70-GS low-risk individuals. The IMPACt trial displayed that the majority (88.5%) of treatment plans were accordant with 
70-GS results, showing that doctors make treatment decisions based on the 70-GS result in clinical practice. Physicians 
also described a rise in confidence in 72.2% of their suggested treatment plans after receiving the 70-GS results. A 
limitation of the study is that individuals were enrolled both before and after the MINDACT trial results were published, 
which may have impacted physicians’ decisions for treatment. The authors concluded that these results propose that 
doctors feel the proper individuals (high-risk) are being presented chemotherapy, and they feel confident sparing 70-GS 
individuals with low-risk from the high clinical and financial burden of chemotherapy. The trial shows that doctors can 
avoid overtreatment and the adverse effects of chemotherapy treatments for individuals who are not likely to obtain 
meaningful clinical benefits. 
 
In 2019, Wuerstlein and colleagues reported on the prospective, observational multicenter WSG-PRIMe study designed to 
gauge the effect of MammaPrint and BluePrint on adjuvant chemotherapy treatment decisions in individuals with early-
stage BC specifically to show an overall switch percentage of at least 15% regarding chemotherapy. These individuals 
had MammaPrint considered as part of their standard clinical procedure. Included in the study were 452 individuals who 
were HR+ and HER2-. Physicians supplied preliminary treatment recommendations created on clinicopathological factors. 
Post-test therapy recommendations and actual therapy were documented after prospective risk classification by 
MammaPrint/BluePrint was revealed. MammaPrint allocated 63.5% of participants to the low-risk group and 36.5% to the 
high-risk group. In 125/430 (29.1%) individuals (95% CI 24.8–33.6%), the recommendation transformed from 
chemotherapy to no chemotherapy or vice versa. Chemotherapy had been recommended to 164 individuals (38.1%) pre-
test. In 60/164 (36.1%) of the individuals who were recommended chemotherapy, the therapy recommendation converted 
to the omission of chemotherapy post-test; most (59/60, 98%) of these changes happened in low-risk individuals, 
according to MammaPrint. On the contrary, deletion of chemotherapy been suggested to 266 individuals (61.9%) pre-test; 
in 65/266 (24.4%) cases, recommendations converted to chemotherapy post-test; most (64/65, 98.4%) of these 
modifications happened in MammaPrint high-risk individuals. The physician observance of MammaPrint risk calculation 
was 92.3% for low-risk and 94.3% for high-risk scores. Three-fourths (n = 59/79, 74.7%) of physicians initially 
recommending chemotherapy converted to no chemotherapy subsequent low-risk MammaPrint results (72.7% in pN0, 
77.1% in pN1); on the contrary, nearly nine tenths (n = 64/72, 88.9%) of physicians originally recommending 
chemotherapy omission from treatment converted to chemotherapy recommendations following high-risk MammaPrint

outcomes (88.1% in pN0, 92.3% in pN1). The authors concluded that the WSG-PRIMe study proves that the use of the 
gene expression profiles, MammaPrint and BluePrint, has a powerful influence on adjuvant therapy recommendations. 
The results showed that physicians changed their ultimate recommendation for systemic therapy in 29.1% of cases 
subsequent MammaPrint testing. The study verified that there is improved, genomically determined individualization of 
treatment regimens that can lead to a reduced risk of over- or undertreatment of individuals. Overall, the high adherence 
to genomically determining risk assessment signifies a significant prerequisite for reaching further targeted disease 
management in early-stage BC. 
 
van Steenhoven et al. (2018) evaluated the ability of 70-GS (MammaPrint) and 80-GS (BluePrint) molecular subtyping to 
surrogate pathological subtyping (PS) for determining treatment options and prognosis. Between 2013 and 2015, 595 
intermediate risk individuals who are ER+ with early-stage BC were studied. HER2 receptor status was determine through 
routine immunohistochemistry and fluorescent in situ hybridization. The overall concordance between molecular sub-
typing and PS for luminal cancers type A and B together was 98%. Individually it was poor, at 64%. The ability of the 80-
GS assay to differentiate between luminal, HER2-type and basal-like cancers was limited, and furthermore the 
concordance between PS and the 70-GS approach was low. The authors concluded that two classification methods had 
significant disparity in outcomes, resulting in the risk of inadequate treatment. More studies are needed to demonstrate 
the efficacy of this test. 
 
The randomized, phase three clinical MINDACT trial included 6693 women with early-stage BC with the primary goal to 
assess whether, among individuals with high-risk clinical features and a low-risk gene-expression profile who did not 
receive chemotherapy, the lower boundary of the 95% confidence interval for the rate of five-year survival without distant 
metastasis would be 92% (i.e., the non-inferiority boundary) or higher. Women at low clinical and genomic risk did not 
receive chemotherapy, while those at high clinical and genomic risk did receive such therapy. For individuals with 
discordant risk results, either the genomic risk or the clinical risk was used to determine the use of chemotherapy. The 
researchers found that among women with early-stage BC who were at high clinical risk and low genomic risk for 
recurrence, the receipt of no chemotherapy on the basis of the 70-gene signature led to a five-year rate of survival without 
distant metastasis that was 1.5 percentage points lower than the rate with chemotherapy. Given these findings, 
approximately 46% of women with BC who are at high clinical risk might not require chemotherapy (Cardoso et al., 2016). 
 
EndoPredict 
EndoPredict (Myriad, Salt Lake City, UT) is a 12-gene real-time genomic test that includes eight disease-relevant genes 
BIRC5, UBE2C, DHCR7, RBBP8, IL6ST, AZGP1, MGP and STC2, three RNA normalization genes (CALM2, OAZ1 and 
RPL37A) and one DNA reference gene (HBB). EndoPredict also incorporates information on nodal status and tumor size. 
Results are given as an “EPclin Risk Score;” a number between 1.1 and 6.2 which relates to cancer recurrence risk. 
 
In a Hayes Molecular Test Assessment, the clinical validity, clinical utility, and analytical validity of EndoPredict were 
evaluated. The assessment uncovered limited but positive evidence suggesting EndoPredict may estimate the ten-year 
risk of DR for individuals with ER+, HER2-, N0, and early-stage BC; however, it remains unclear if the test can 
prospectively distinguish low-risk individuals from others or if the test is equally applicable for premenopausal women. 
There is limited evidence suggesting EndoPredict may estimate the ten-year risk of DR for individuals with ER+, HER2-, 
N1, and early-stage BC, and conflicting results to determine if the EPclin low-risk group was genuinely associated with a 
low-risk of DR in this population. For the EndoPredict test to estimate the likelihood of DR five to fifteen years from 
diagnosis and the absolute benefit of chemotherapy at ten years for individuals with ER+, HER2-, N0/N1, early-stage 
cancer, there are limited studies and data to support the test results. No prospectively designed studies were found 
regarding the clinical validity of EndoPredict; additional studies are necessary to examine diverse demographics and 
possibly improve health outcomes resulting from the EndoPredict test (Hayes, EndoPredict [Myriad Genetics Laboratories 
Inc.], 2020, updated 2023). 
 
In the prospective, translational, randomized phase two ABCSG-34 trial directed by Dubsky et al. (2020), the ability of 
EndoPredict to predict response to NCT or NET was assessed. HR+, HER2- samples were gathered from participants, 
and EndoPredict testing was completed to produce a 12-gene MS. Participants were randomized to have either NCT or 
NET based on menopausal status, HR expression, grade, and Ki67. The outcome measured was calculated via the 
residual cancer burden (RCB). Overall, 134 individuals who were HR+ received NCT, and 83 received NET as their 
preoperative SoC treatment. Out of 134 participants who received NCT, nine had low-risk disease according to the 12- 
gene MS, and 125 had high-risk disease. The 12-gene MS exhibited strong sensitivity for NCT (100%, 95% CI 89.4%-
100%), even though specificity was small (8.9%, 95% CI 4.2%-16.2%). Of the participants treated with NET, 44 out of 83 
had low-risk disease, and 39 had high-risk disease. According to the authors, this is the first study that prospectively 
proves the predictive probability of the 12-gene MS for its response to NET. The RCB 0-I outcome for individuals with 
NET in the low-risk 12-gene MS subset was 27% in contrast to 7.7% in individuals with high-risk MS. The data presented

in this trial shows that the 12-gene MS offers supplementary predictive data beyond the traditional clinicopathologic 
factors used to evaluate risk and is a valuable instrument preoperatively.  
 
Sestak et al. (2020) retrospectively investigated a cohort of individuals with invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) from 
previously conducted clinical trials (ABCSG-6, ABCSG-8, TransATAC). The main objective of the study was to determine 
the prognostic value of EPclin, either alone or in combination with clinical parameters, for DR in women with ILC. All 
participants had received five years of endocrine treatment as the only adjuvant therapy. Information compiled from the 
three clinical trials included data from 2630 postmenopausal women with ER+, HER2- BC. As part of that group, 470 
(19.5%) had ILC, 1944 (80.5%) had IDC and 216 (8.2%) had another histological subtype. The researchers found that in 
this study, EPclin was highly prognostic in women with ILC [HR = 3.32 (2.54–4.34), p < .0001] and provided better 
prognostic value than the Clinical Treatment Score [CTS; HR = 2.17 (1.73–2.72)]. Further, they found that EPclin was 
prognostic in women with IDC (n = 1944) overall [HR = 2.36 (2.11–2.65), p < 0.0001], though not to the level of ILC. They 
concluded that EPclin provided substantial prognostic information and risk stratification for women with ILC. This study 
was included in Hayes, EndoPredict (Myriad Genetics Laboratories Inc., 2020), and the Hyams et al. (2024) systematic 
review discussed above. 
 
Penault-Llorca et al. (2020) led a prospective single-arm multicenter trial calculating the clinical and psychological 
influence of EndoPredict use for individuals with ER+ HR- localized BC. The trial assessed the quantity of change from 
the initial adjuvant decision and the last administration of chemotherapy. Secondary measures involved post-test (Day 17) 
and one-year patient-reported results. The trial encompassed 203 participants from 25 centers: 201 had an EPclin 
assessment. Overall, the decision to treat compared to the initial decision was changed for 72/200 (36%, 95% CI 29.3-
42.7) individuals. Chemotherapy was first recommended to 48% of individuals, of which only 26% underwent 
chemotherapy. Chemotherapy was withdrawn in 57 cases (28.4%, 95% CI 22.2-34.8), and in 15 cases (7.5%, 95% CI 
3.8-11.2), chemotherapy was added. The choices to change therapy were often associated with the EPclin outcomes. The 
trial exposed that in individuals with early BC at intermediate risk, using EPclin to back up the treatment choice resulted in 
a 35.8% change in whether adjuvant chemotherapy was given. The trial shows how the test permits a decrease in centers 
and physicians’ therapy decision heterogeneity. The trial has limitations associated with the non-randomized method, 
open design, and risk of bias in participant selection. The authors concluded that the EPclin test has an established 
influence that can reduce adjuvant chemotherapy treatments under ordinary circumstances. 
 
Breast Cancer Index (BCI) 
BCI (BioTheranostics, San Diego, CA) is a gene expression-based signature that analyzes the combination of two 
biomarker panels: the HOXB13:IL17BR ratio (H/I) and the Molecular Grade Index (MGI), consisting of the average 
expression of five cell cycle-associate gene index (BUB1B, CENPA, NEK2, RACGAP1, RRM2). The test is performed on 
a FFPE tissue block and results in a single prognostic score quantifying both the risk of late (5-10 years) and overall (0-10 
years) DR (Sgroi et al., 2022). 
 
The evidence supporting predictive tests for the extension of ET in individuals with BC has been limited to date. Woolpert 
et al. (2023) explored the role of biomarker tests in the prediction of clinical response to extended ET in a systematic 
review and meta-analysis. A total of five studies met eligibility requirements and were included; four investigated the BCI 
assay in three unique study populations and one explored the predictive ability of Ki67 and progesterone receptor status. 
The studies focused on BCI reliably demonstrated that the BCI score predicted response to an extension of ET in 1946 
combined participants (primarily non-Hispanic white and postmenopausal). The authors recommend further study of an 
assortment of biomarkers in diverse populations of individuals. Studies by Noordhoek et al. (2021), and Bartlett et al. 
(2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Woolpert systematic review and meta-analysis. 
 
Hayes evaluated the use of the BCI test for predicting likelihood of benefit from EET (greater than five years) and 
estimating risk of late (greater than five years from diagnosis) and cumulative DR risk over ten years in individuals 
diagnosed with HR+, N0 or N1 invasive BC treated with five years primary adjuvant ET or primary ET. The Hayes 
assessment found insufficient evidence to support the BCI test for the prediction of likelihood of benefit from EET or to 
estimate the risk of late and cumulative DR risk over ten years in these situations. For individuals with HR+, N1 invasive 
BC, Hayes again found the evidence supporting the use of BCI for predicting benefit of EET or estimating risk of DR in 
individuals treated with five years of primary adjuvant chemotherapy to be lacking. Further investigation including large, 
prospective, randomized trials examining diverse populations and health outcomes related to use of the BCI test are 
recommended. The 2023 update to these BCI Molecular Test Assessments indicate no change to the current Hayes 
ratings (Hayes, Breast Cancer Index [BioTheranostics Inc.] for Lymph Node–Negative Patients, 2020, updated 2023; 
Hayes, Breast Cancer Index [BioTheranostics Inc.] for Lymph Node–Positive (1-3) Patients, 2020, updated 2023). 
 
Sestak et al. (2018) provided a secondary analysis of data obtained from the Anastrozole or Tamoxifen Alone or 
Combined RCT, comparing five-year treatment with anastrozole vs tamoxifen with ten-year follow-up data. The objective

was to compare the prognostic value of Oncotype Dx recurrence score, PAM50 based Prosigna ROR, BCI, EndoPredict, 
Clinical Treatment Score, and four-marker immunohistochemical score to the Clinical Treatment Score (nodal status, 
tumor size, grade, age, and endocrine treatment) for DR for zero to ten years and five to ten years after diagnosis. The 
analysis included 774 post-menopausal women with estrogen positive, HER2- disease. Five hundred and ninety-one had 
N0 disease. All genomic signature tests provided significantly more information than the clinical treatment score, the RS 
and the four marker immunohistochemical score alone. The most valuable tests were the PAM50 and BCI. In the 183 
individuals with N1, there was limited information provided by the molecular tests, and BCI and EndoPredict provided the 
most value. The authors concluded that the data provided by molecular testing could help oncologists and individuals 
consider chemotherapy or extended endocrine testing. This study is included in Hayes EndoPredict (Myriad Genetics 
Laboratories Inc.), 2020, Hayes Breast Cancer Index (BioTheranostics Inc.) for Lymph Node–Negative Patients, 2020, as 
well as the Hyams et al. 2021 systematic review discussed above.  
 
Zhang et al. (2017b) examined the predictive ability of BCI results, when integrated with tumor size and grade Breast 
Cancer Index Model (BCIN), to accurately identify outcomes in a well annotated retrospective series of N+ individuals. A 
total of 402 participants with N1 who were treated with adjuvant ET with or without chemotherapy using a prespecified 
model. The primary endpoint was time to DR. BCIN classified 20% of participants as low-risk with a 15-year DR rate of 
1.3% and 321 individuals as high-risk with a DR risk of 29%. When the results were unblinded and compared to 
participant outcome, BCI alone was significantly prognostic (p < .0001), and when tumor size was added the prognostic 
ability was even further improved (p < .0003) but only incrementally with adding tumor grade (p = .01). Overall, BCIN 
identified 20% of individuals who were N+ with a limited ROR over 15 years that could avoid extended endocrine 
treatment. Further studies on combined genomic and clinical algorithmic predictions are needed on N+ individuals. This 
study is included in Hayes, Breast Cancer Index (BioTheranostics Inc.) for Lymph Node–Positive (1-3) Patients, 2020. 
 
Other Breast Cancer Profiling Assays 
Gene expression profiling assays for BC treatment other than those previously described, including but not limited to, 
Breast Cancer Gene Expression Ratio (also known as Theros H/I), DCISionRT, Oncotype DX DCIS, the 41-gene 
signature assay, and the 76-gene "Rotterdam signature" lack sufficient evidence to support clinical utility at this time. 
 
DCISionRT
 
DCISionRT (Prelude Corporation, Laguna Hills, CA) is a risk assessment test for individuals with ductal carcinoma in situ 
(DCIS) which is designed to quantify an individual’s ten-year risk of DCIS recurrence and determine whether radiation 
therapy would be of benefit. DCISionRT assesses 7 genes along with other clinical risk factors to provide a DCISionRT 
score ranging from 0 to 10. Scores 0-3 are considered low risk and scores 3-10 are considered elevated risk. 
 
In a 2023 a systematic review and meta-analysis, Ouattara et al. evaluated women with DCIS who had been treated with 
breast-conserving surgery (BCS) to determine the impact of adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) on local recurrence (LR) 
according to risk stratification per molecular signature testing. Five studies including 3478 women with DCIS who had 
been treated with BCS were included in this evaluation. A molecular assay was performed for each of the women 
included. The effect of BCS and RT versus with BCS alone on LR was analyzed. The analysis included both ipsilateral 
invasive breast events (InvBE) and total breast events (TotBE). Two molecular signature tests were used: the Oncotype 
Dx DCIS (prognostic of LR) and DCISionRT (prognostic of LR and predictive of RT benefit). In the high-risk group, for 
DCISionRT, pooled HR of BCS + RT versus BCS was 0.39 (95%CI 0.20–0.77) for InvBE and 0.34 (95%CI 0.22–0.52) for 
TotBE. In the low-risk group, pooled HR of BCS+ RT versus BCS was significant for TotBE at 0.62 (95%CI 0.39–0.99) but 
was not significant InvBE (HR = 0.58 [95%CI 0.25–1.32]). The researchers maintain that molecular signature tests can 
discriminate high- and low- risk individuals; individuals at high-risk showed a significant benefit of RT for reduction of 
invasive and in situ LR and individuals at low-risk did not show benefit for prevention of recurrence of invasive BC. While 
molecular signatures may be a promising tool for balancing over- and undertreatment of DCIS, further understanding of 
the basis of invasive cancer is needed. The study was limited by the lack of data on breast-cancer specific mortality and 
individual data on recurrence-free survival. Further high-quality evaluation, including studies focused on impact on 
mortality are required.  
 
Hayes (2022) published a Molecular Test Assessment evaluating the use of the DCISionRT test to assist individuals with 
DCIS and their providers with decision-making regarding the use of BCS alone or BCS plus RT. Hayes found a lack of 
published evidence to support the use of the DCISionRT test. The 2024 update of this assessment identified three newly 
published studies that may meet the inclusion criteria set out in the original report and an unlikely change in the current 
Hayes rating of D2 (Hayes, DCISionRT [Prelude Corp.], 2022, updated 2024). 
 
Shah et al. (2021) documented the results of the PREDICT study; a prospective, multi-institutional observational registry 
designed to evaluate the clinical utility of testing with DCISionRT on clinical recommendations regarding RT for individuals

who had undergone BCS for a diagnosis of DCIS. The study included 539 women over the age of 25 who had been 
treated with BCS for unilateral DCIS. All women were eligible to receive RT and received DCISionRT testing as part of the 
study. Prior to testing, 69% of all participants had received a recommendation of treatment with RT. After testing with 
DCISionRT, 46% of those that had previously received recommendation for RT had a change in recommendation to not 
receive RT. Conversely, for women who were not initially recommended to undergo RT, 35% had a change in 
recommendation for treatment to include RT. In summary, a change in RT treatment plan was made for 42% of women in 
the study, with a net reduction in overall RT recommendation of 20%. The elevated DS had the strongest association with 
an RT recommendation (OR 43.4) compared to other factors such as age, grade, size, and margin status. The authors 
concluded that DCISionRT testing made a significant difference, including an absolute net decrease in RT 
recommendations overall in women with DCIS who had undergone BCS, and was the factor most strongly associated with 
RT recommendations compared with traditional measures used to drive treatment decisions. The authors also noted 
limitations to the study. One such limitation was the lack of patient or physician-reported outcomes regarding satisfaction 
or quality (pending at time of publication). In addition, data on recommendations for RT were only based on two points in 
time; pre-testing and post-testing. Finally, there is a lack of long-term clinical outcomes and data on subsequent resource 
utilization related to treatment decisions. These items are planned for further evaluation and assessment when longer 
follow-up data become available. This study was included in the 2022 Hayes DCISionRT (Prelude Corp.) Molecular Test 
Assessment. 
 
Choosing the optimal treatment approach for individuals diagnosed with DCIS has been a significant challenge and a 
topic of active research. A major goal is to understand the ROR for DCIS. In a 2020 publication, Weinmann et al. 
(included in the systematic review and meta-analysis by Ouattara et al. [2023], discussed above, and the Hayes 2022 
DCISionRT Molecular Test Assessment) described the results of their external prospective–retrospective clinical 
validation of DCISionRT, a ten-year recurrence/progression risk assessment test using monoclonal protein markers and 
clinicopathologic factors (age at diagnosis, palpability, tumor size and surgical margin status) for individuals with DCIS 
who had undergone BCS. The outcome of the DCISionRT test is called the decision score (DS). Study participants 
included 455 Kaiser Permanent Northwest members over the age of 25 diagnosed with DCIS and treated with BCS with 
or without radiotherapy from 1990 to 2007. Kaplan Meier analysis and Cox regression were used to measure the ability of 
the DS to predict outcomes beyond that of clinicopathology factors. The researchers found a positive association of the 
DS produced by DCISionRT with total breast event and invasive breast event risk after adjustment for radiotherapy in the 
Cox regression analysis. Kaplan-Meier analyses showed that elevated-risk DS scores showed more than twice the ten-
year risk of total breast events compared to low-risk DS scores. The authors concluded that DS score from DCISionRT 
test was prognostic for risk of later breast events in this study group. Despite these promising results, the study had some 
noteworthy limitations. Most study participants with DCIS received adjuvant radiotherapy, so there were fewer BCS 
without radiotherapy participants in the study to analyze. Statistical power was more limited for assessment of DS 
associated with invasive BC because approximately half of the total breast events were invasive. In addition, some 
participants had received ET, which may have impacted overall outcomes. While the study indicates elevated DS scores 
would suggest a preferential radiotherapy benefit, this study design did not assess radiotherapy benefit. In addition, some 
of the risk difference between radiation treated and nontreated cohorts might be related to the individuals’ selection for 
treatment, since the study was not randomized or rule based. Further research is needed to provide more evidence to 
support routine DCISionRT testing. 
 
Bremer et al. (2018, included in the systematic review and meta-analysis by Ouattara et al. [2023], discussed above) 
reported on the development and cross-validation of DCISionRT (PreludeDX). DCISionRT is a risk assessment test that 
uses a combination of molecular and clinicopathologic factors to generate a biological signature which calculates an 
individualized DS. The relationship between DS and ten-year risk of invasive breast cancer (IBC) or any ipsilateral breast 
event (IBE) was assessed in this study. Benefit of radiotherapy was evaluated as a function of DS, by risk group. Study 
population included 526 individuals diagnosed with a primary DCIS and treated with BCS, with or without radiotherapy, 
from two study sites. The study used archived tissue samples. Treatments for the study participants were neither 
randomized nor strictly rules based. The researchers found a significant association with IBC and IBE risk. In study 
participants who had been treated without RT, the DS identified a low group with ten-year IBC risk of 4% (7% IBE) and an 
elevated risk group with IBC risk of 15% (23% IBE). The elevated risk group received significant RT benefit in analysis of 
DS and RT by group. In a clinicopathologically low-risk-subset, 42% of participants were reclassified into the elevated risk 
group by using DS. When an interaction analysis of DS and RT was performed, participants whose DS was elevated had 
significant RT benefit over baseline. The authors concluded that DS appeared to be prognostic for risk and for predicting 
benefit of RT for individuals with DCIS status-post BCS and was able to identify a clinically meaningful low-risk group and 
an elevated ten-year risk group, whose members may receive significant benefit from RT over baseline. However, further 
clinical validations are required to provide more evidence on the capabilities, both prognostic and predictive, of the 
biological signature and DS.

Oncotype Dx DCIS 
The Oncotype Dx DCIS assay (Genomic Health, Redwood City, CA) uses reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction 
(PCR) with DNA extracted from excised tumor tissue to assess expression levels of 12 genes. A Breast DS designed to 
represent the risk of BC recurrence within ten years of original diagnosis (0 to 100) is then calculated for the individual.  
 
In 2024, Hayes published a Molecular Test Assessment addressing the Oncotype DX Breast DCIS Score (Exact 
Sciences). The assessment revealed an overall low-quality body of evidence addressing the use of the DCIS score test 
for individuals recently diagnosed with DCIS to evaluate ten-year recurrence risk and assist with treatment decision-
making. Although there is limited evidence suggesting that the DCIS score test may be correlated with reduced RT in 
those individuals with low DCIS score results, clinical outcomes of DCIS score-based treatment decisions are unknown. 
No studies that assessed the performance or clinical utility of the current version of the test, and no studies directly 
comparing the DCIS score test with other clinical tools for predicting recurrence risk and informing treatment were 
identified. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
In 2022, Andre et al. updated ASCO recommendations regarding the appropriate use of biomarker assay results to inform 
decisions regarding adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in early-stage BC. Evidence for these recommendations was 
based on information from 24 applicable studies (14 RCTs and ten prospective-retrospective). The recommendations 
include the following: 
 Oncotype DX, MammaPrint, BCI, and EndoPredict may be used to guide adjuvant endocrine and chemotherapy in 
postmenopausal individuals or individuals over the age of 50 years with early-stage ER+, HER2- BC that is node-
negative or with one to three positive nodes. 
 BCI and ProSigna may be used in postmenopausal individuals with node-negative ER+, HER2- BC. 
 For premenopausal individuals, Oncotype DX may be used with node-negative ER+, HER2- BC. 
 BCI may be offered to individuals with zero to three positive nodes who have undergone five years of ET with no 
evidence of recurrence to aid with decision-making regarding EET. 
 No assays are recommended for individuals with HER2+ or triple-negative BC. 
 
Evidence from ASCO’s review indicates that premenopausal women with one to three positive nodes will show benefit 
from chemotherapy regardless of genomic assay results. No data supporting the use of genomic tests for informing 
adjuvant chemotherapy in in individuals with four or more positive nodes was identified. When access to genomic tests is 
not available, Ki67 in combinations with other parameters or an IHC4 score may be used to assist with decision-making 
regarding adjuvant therapy. ASCO further recommends the incorporation of factors such as disease stage, comorbidities 
and patient preference into decision-making. 
 
In 2020, Hassett et al. published recommendations for managing male BC. These recommendations were the result of a 
review of 26 reports/observational studies by an ASCO Expert Panel which formed the base of evidence on which the 
recommendations were developed. The panel found that several of the management methods used for men with BC are 
predominantly the same as those used for women and include the following recommendations regarding molecular 
testing: 
 Gene expression profiling should be used to guide adjuvant treatment decision-making. 
 Targeted therapy guided by HER2, programmed death ligand 1 (PD-L1), PIK3CA and germline BRCA mutation status 
may be used for treatment of metastatic/advanced male BC with the same indications and combinations that are 
routinely offered to women. 
 Males with BC should be offered genetic counseling and testing for germline mutations. 
 
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
In the 2024 ESMO Clinical Practice Guideline addressing diagnosis, treatment and follow up of early BC, Loibl et al. made 
the following recommendations regarding the use of GEP:  
 When uncertainty about indications for adjuvant chemotherapy exist after consideration of all clinical and pathological 
factor, GEP and endocrine response assessment in the preoperative setting can be used (Level of Evidence II, Grade 
of Recommendation B). 
 Treatment strategy for each individual should be based on their own risk-benefit analysis, considering many factors 
including tumor burden and biology (including biomarkers and gene expression), as well as age, menopausal status, 
general health and individual preference (Level of Evidence I, Grade of Recommendation A).

Public Health Service Grading System.) 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) Clinical Guidelines  
NCCN BC guidelines indicate that “gene expression assays provide prognostic and therapy-predictive information that 
complements tumor (T), node (N), distant metastasis (M) and biomarker information. Use of these assays is not required 
for staging.” The 21-gene assay (Oncotype Dx) is preferred by the NCCN Breast Cancer Panel since it has been clinically 
validated for the prognosis and prediction of chemotherapy benefit. While other GEAs can provide prognostic information, 
they do not necessarily predict chemotherapy benefit. NCCN notes that the BCI test is predictive of benefit of extended 
adjuvant endocrine therapy (NCCN Breast Cancer, v6.2024). 
 
NCCN categorizes the primary GEAs for consideration of adjuvant systemic therapy in individuals with invasive BC as

National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
The 2024 NICE guideline addressing tumor profiling tests for informing adjuvant chemotherapy decisions in early BC 
makes the following recommendations regarding gene expression tests:  
 EndoPredict, Oncotype DX, or Prosigna may be used as options along with consideration of clinical risk factors to 
guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for the treatment of ER- or PR- positive, HER2-negative early BC with one to 
three positive lymph nodes for women who have been through the menopause, men and/or trans, non-binary or 
intersex people, depending on their hormonal profile. Clinical judgement should be used to determine is testing is 
appropriate for men, trans or non-binary or intersex individuals. 
 EndoPredict, Oncotype DX, or Prosigna should not be used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for ER- or PR-
positive, HER2-negative early BC with one to three positive lymph nodes in women who have not been through 
menopause. 
 MammaPrint should not be used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for individuals with ER- or PR-positive, 
HER2-negative early BC with one to three positive lymph nodes. 
 EndoPredict, Oncotype DX or Prosigna can be used in the National Health Services (NHS) to guide adjuvant 
chemotherapy decisions for individuals with ER- or PR-positive, HER2-negative, and LN-negative (including micro 
metastatic disease) EBC while more evidence is generated if: 
o Individual has an intermediate risk of DR per use of a validated tool such as Predict or the Nottingham Prognostic 
Index. 
o Clinicians and companies make timely, complete, and linkable record-level test data available to the National 
Cancer Registration and Analysis Service. 
 MammaPrint and IHC4+C should not be used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for people with ER- or PR-
positive, HER2‐negative, and LN-negative EBC.

 EndoPredict, Oncotype DX or Prosigna may be used to guide adjuvant chemotherapy decisions for ER- or PR-
positive, HER2 negative early BC if: 
o The individual undergoing testing will use the results to help in the decision, along with their healthcare 
professional, whether or not to have adjuvant chemotherapy. 
o The tests are used within their intended purpose: 
▪ EndoPredict (ER-positive, or both ER- and PR-positive). 
▪ Oncotype DX (ER- or PR-positive, or both). 
▪ Prosigna (ER- or PR-positive, or both; only for women who have been through the menopause). 
o The companies provide the tests to the NHS with the discounts agreed in the access proposal. 
o Laboratories that process the tests take part in a UK national external quality assurance scheme. 
 The test and results should be used alongside NICE's guideline on shared decision making. An oncologist should 
explain to the individual what their tumor profiling test results mean, and the risks and benefits of treatment options 
based on all available risk factors. 
 
Lung Cancer 
A 2023 (updated 2024) Hayes Molecular Test Assessment evaluated the Percepta Genomic Sequencing Classifier 
(GSC)(Veracyte). One poor-quality study assessing clinical validity reported high negative predictive values for 
downclassifying risk of malignancy (ROM) in individuals at low- and intermediate-risk, mixed positive predictive values for 
upclassifying ROM in individuals at intermediate- and high-risk, and unknown clinical performance for individuals with 
unchanged ROM after Percepta GSC testing. With regard to clinical utility, one poor quality study reported statistically 
insignificant reductions in invasive procedure plans for individuals whose ROMs were downclassified (74% reduction) and 
unchanged (50% reduction). This low-quality body of evidence is insufficient to fully assess the clinical benefits of the 
Percepta GSC. The 2024 update to this Hayes assessment revealed no newly published studies that met inclusion criteria 
for evaluation of this test. 
 
Liquid biopsy analysis using circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or cell-free DNA (cfDNA) is a developing technology that can 
be used as an alternative to tissue profiling in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In a systematic review and meta-
analysis, Zaman et al. (2023) sought to assess the prognostic value of molecular profiling via ctDNA or cfDNA in NSCLC. 
Twenty-seven studies including 3419 individuals were included in the analysis. Eleven studies including 1359 participants 
reported on the association of baseline ctDNA with progression-free survival (PFS) and 16 studies including 1659 
participants reported on dynamic changes in ctDNA associated with PFS. The analysis revealed that individuals with 
negative baseline ctDNA trended towards improved PFS (pooled hazard ratio [pHR] = 1.35; 95%CI: 0.83-1.87; p < 0.001; 
I
2 
= 96%) when compared to individuals who were ctDNA-positive. In addition, when early reduction/clearance of ctDNA 
levels occurred after treatment, individuals showed improved PFS (pHR = 0.71; 95%CI: 1.85-3.65; I
2 
= 89.4%) in 
comparison with individuals showing no reduction/persistence in ctDNA levels. Only good and fair quality studies (based 
on assessment via the Newcastle-Ottowa Scale [NOS]) exhibited improvement in PFS (pHR = 1.95; 95%CI: 1.52-2.38 
and pHR = 1.99; 95%CI: 1.09-2.89, respectively); this did not occur in poor quality studies included in the analysis. The 
authors note that this review and analysis revealed a high level of heterogeneity and publication bias, but despite these 
limitations, baseline negative ctDNA levels and an early reduction in ctDNA after therapy may be robust prognostic 
indicators for PFS and OS in individuals who undergo targeted therapies for advanced NSCLC. The authors recommend 
additional studies including serial ctDNA testing to further support clinical utility in the management of advanced NSCLC. 
 
Sakata et al. (2022) conducted a multi-center retrospective study to evaluate the success rate of genetic alteration testing 
in four driver genes (epidermal growth factor [EGFR], anaplastic lymphoma kinase [ALK], c-ros oncogene 1 [ROS1], and 
v-raf murine sarcoma viral oncogene homolog B1 [BRAF] using the Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx System in 
individuals with NSCLC. A total of 533 participants with NSCLC whose diagnoses were confirmed using histological or 
cytological methods, and who had undergone testing for 46 genes using the Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx System 
between June 2019 and January 2020 were enrolled in the study. The median age was 72 years (range 25-94 years), and 
345 participants (64.7%) were male. The percentages of participants with adenocarcinoma detected histologically or those 
with stage IV disease were 73.2% and 46.0%, respectively. PD-L1 status was evaluated in 497 participants; among these, 
133 (25.0%) showed more than 50% PD-L1 expression. Evaluation of participant smoking history showed that 138 
(25.9%) had never smoked, whereas 394 participants (74.1%) had a history of smoking. The success rate of genetic 
alteration testing for all four genes was 80.1% (95% CI 76.5%-83.4%). Surgical resection was associated with the highest 
success rate (88.0%), which was significantly higher than that for bronchoscopic biopsy (76.8%, p = .005). Multivariate 
analysis revealed a difference for surgical resection alone (p = .006, 95% CI 1.36-6.18, odds ratio 2.90). The authors 
concluded that optimizing specimen quantity and quality may improve the use of driver gene testing in clinical settings. 
Limitations include the absence of data on the exact number of submitted slides and the amount of DNA or RNA input in 
the submitted samples for Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx System testing. In addition, the study is limited by its 
retrospective observations conducted immediately after approval of the Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx System.

Subsequently, several modifications were made for conducting next-generation sequencing (NGS) tests, including those 
using the Oncomine Dx Target Test Multi-CDx System at each hospital.  
 
A comparison study by Yao et al. (2021) was performed to develop a quick gene testing procedure using fresh core 
needle biopsy samples from individuals with NSCLC. Thirty participants with NSCLC confirmed by frozen section 
examination were enrolled to compare the results of multi-gene mutation testing using fresh frozen (FF) tissues and 
paired formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE) tissues. A total of 77 fresh NSCLC tissue samples obtained from core 
needle biopsy were evaluated by frozen section examination. The 77 participants consisted of 39 males (50.6%) and 38 
females (49.4%) with a median age of 65 years (range, 42–85 years) of which 32 were smokers (41.6%) vs 45 
nonsmokers (58.4%). Frozen section examination revealed 70 (90.9%) AC, 6 (7.8%) SCC, and 1 (1.3%) adenosquamous 
carcinoma (ASC), which is consistent with the final pathological diagnosis using FFPE tissues. If the NSCLC diagnosis 
and adequate tumor cell counts were confirmed by histopathology, the fresh tissues were used to extract DNA and 
subsequent gene testing by ARMS-PCR. The paired FFPE core needle biopsy samples were from 30 individuals with 
NSCLC in stage IV, randomly selected for this study, who also underwent gene testing. The 77 fresh samples showed an 
EGFR mutation rate of 61.0%. The clinical treatment strategy for participants was optimized based on gene test results. 
Using this procedure of gene mutation testing, the time interval between physicians requesting and obtaining a test result 
has been shortened to fewer than 2 days. Following a comparison of gene testing results with fresh tissues and paired 
FFPE tissues from the 30 participants, no difference in the DNA concentration extracted from fresh tissues and FFPE 
tissues was found. DNA purity, however, was higher in fresh tissues than that in FFPE tissues. Gene testing detected the 
same gene mutations in 93.3% of cases in fresh tissues and paired FFPE tissues. The authors concluded that gene 
testing procedure using fresh biopsy samples greatly shortens waiting time. The multi-gene mutation testing using fresh 
core needle biopsy samples from individuals with NSCLC is a reasonable, achievable, and quick approach. The authors 
stated that fresh tissues may serve as a potential alternative to FFPE tissues for gene testing in individuals with NSCLC. 
Limitations to this study include a risk of misdiagnosis during frozen section examination and uncertain diagnosis of fresh 
tissues related to lack of pathologist experience. Additionally, the sensitivity and specificity of gene testing using FF 
tissues are 96 and 75% when compared with FFPE tissues. The high sensitivity and low specificity may be attributed to 
the selection of cases through frozen section examination. The sample size is too small to prove the usefulness of this 
test as a diagnostic tool. Further research with randomized controlled trials is needed to validate these findings. 
 
Wang et al. (2020) conducted a cohort study using a multiplexed PCR-based panel developed to simultaneously test 118 
hotspot mutations and fusions in nine driver genes capable of comprehensively determining individual genotypes as tumor 
predictive biomarkers. Surgically resected samples from 214 participants with NSCLC (168 with adenocarcinomas and 46 
with squamous cell cancers) were included in this cohort study. A multiplexed PCR-based assay was developed to 
simultaneously test 118 hotspot mutations and fusions in nine driver genes. The sensitivity of the kit was 1% for gene 
mutation and 450 copies for gene fusion. Genetic alterations were detected in 143 (66.8%) participants by the assay. The 
three most common alterations identified were EGFR mutations (50.9%), KRAS mutations (8.4%) and ALK fusions 
(4.7%). Eight (3.7%) participants harbored concurrent mutations, and the most common partners were EGFR mutations 
which were observed in the eight participants. No associations between survival and EGFR, KRAS, and ALK status were 
observed. Participants with two or more alterations exhibited shorter DFS compared to those with single mutations (p = 
0.032), whilst had no difference in overall survival (OS) (p = 0.245). However, only TNM stage was an independent 
predictor of OS (HR = 2.905, p < 0.001) as well as DFS (HR = 2.114, p < 0.001) in this cohort in multivariate analysis. 
Participants with the L858R mutation had longer DFS (p = 0.014) compared to other sensitizing mutations and tended to 
have better OS (p = 0.06). The authors concluded that the mutational profile of oncogenic driver genes plays an important 
role in NSCLC as several core oncogenic driver genes have been considered to be tumor predictive biomarkers. 
Furthermore, the authors stated that this study suggested a multiplex gene panel testing technique may be used to detect 
nine driver genes in a limited number of specimens. In addition, this methodology would have the potential to save both 
specimens and time compared to the combination of all assays by other methods. A small sample size which may have 
reduced statistical power makes it difficult to decide whether these conclusions can be generalized to a larger population. 
The findings of this study need to be validated by well-designed studies. 
 
Drilon et al. (2015) identified 31 individuals with lung adenocarcinoma along with a ≤ 15 pack-year smoking history whose 
tumors previously tested "negative" for alterations in 11 genes (mutations in EGFR, ERBB2, KRAS, NRAS, BRAF, 
MAP2K1, PIK3CA, and AKT1 and fusions involving ALK, ROS1, and RET) via multiple non-NGS methods. A broad, 
hybrid capture–based NGS assay (Foundation One) was performed (4,557 exons of 287 cancer-related genes and 47 
introns of 19 genes frequently rearranged in solid tumors). A genomic alteration with a corresponding targeted therapeutic 
based on the National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) guidelines for non–small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was 
found in 26% (n = 8 of 31) of participants. The drivers identified in tumors from these eight participants were EGFR 
G719A, BRAF V600E, SOCS5-ALK, HIP1-ALK, CD74-ROS1, KIF5B-RET (n = 2), and CCDC6-RET. Six of the 
participants went on to receive targeted therapy. The authors noted that the reasons for non-detection of these genomic 
alterations via non-NGS testing can be varied such as lower sensitivity, complex rearrangements undetectable by

standard fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), and, possibly, heterogeneity between different tumor biopsies or sites. 
They concluded that broad, hybrid capture–based NGS assays have the potential to uncover clinically actionable genomic 
alterations in never smokers or ≤ 15 pack-year smokers whose lung adenocarcinomas do not harbor a potential driver via 
non-NGS testing. (Oxnard et al., 2016, Riediger et al., 2016). 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American College of Chest Physicians (ACCP)  
In an evidence-based clinical practice guideline for the diagnosis and management of lung cancer, the ACCP states that 
the epidemiology of lung cancer is an active field. According to the ACCP, researchers in molecular epidemiology are 
making advances in the identification of biomarkers of risk and for early detection, although these are not yet mature 
enough for clinical application (Detterbeck et al., 2013).  
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
ASCO endorsed the College of American Pathologists/International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/Association 
for Molecular Pathology Clinical Practice Guideline Update with minor modifications (Kalemkerian et al., 2018). The 
guidelines, supported by ASCO, include the following relevant points, considered to be expert consensus opinion. 
 Physicians may use molecular biomarker testing in tumors with: 
o An adenocarcinoma component; 
o Nonsquamous, non–small-cell histology; 
o Any non–small-cell histology when clinical features indicate a higher probability of an oncogenic driver (e.g., 
young age [< 50 years]; light or absent tobacco exposure).  
 BRAF testing should be performed on all patients with advanced lung adenocarcinoma, irrespective of clinical 
characteristics. RET, or KRAS, or MET molecular testing are not recommended as single gene routine stand-alone 
assays outside the context of a clinical trial. It is appropriate to include these as part of larger testing panels performed 
either initially or when routine EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and ROS1 testing is negative. 
 Multiplexed genetic sequencing panels are preferred where available over multiple single-gene tests to identify other 
treatment options beyond EGFR, ALK, BRAF, and ROS1. 
 Circulating tumor cell free DNA testing, also called a liquid biopsy, should not be routinely considered due to lack of 
evidence of efficacy. However, the expert consensus opinion provided is that cfDNA may be used in some clinical 
settings in which tissue is limited and/or insufficient for molecular testing to identify EGFR mutations. 
 
College of American Pathologists/Association for Molecular Pathology/International 
Association for the Study of Lung Cancer/Pulmonary Pathology Society/LUNGevity 
Foundation 
In 2024, the College of American Pathologists convened a panel of experts in non-small cell lung cancer and biomarker 
testing to develop evidence-based guidelines on the testing of program death ligand-1 (PD-L1) and tumor mutation 
burden (TMB) in patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer (Sholl et al.):  
 In patients with advanced non–small cell lung cancer, pathologists should use a validated PD-L1 
immunohistochemistry expression assay, in conjunction with other targetable genomic biomarker assays where 
appropriate, to optimize selection for treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors. (Strength of Recommendation: 
Strong; Certainty of Evidence: Moderate). 
 Clinicians should not use TMB alone to select patients with advanced NSCLC for immune checkpoint inhibitors, based 
on insufficient evidence in this population. (Strength of Recommendation: Conditional; Certainty of Evidence: Very 
Low). 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN guidelines for NSCLC (version 1.2025) indicate that numerous gene alterations impacting treatment selection have 
been identified. Thus, testing for these alterations is necessary to identify the most effective targeted therapies and avoid 
treatment unlikely to provide clinical benefit. NCCN recommends that when feasible, testing be performed via a broad, 
panel-based approach, most often using NGS, acknowledging that many of the marketed NGS-based assays used to fully 
genotype NSCLC are larger than 50 genes. Use of these larger panels may be practical to achieve full genotyping 
information. In addition, the guidelines include a discussion of the role of plasma cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing, 
stating that cell-free/circulating tumor DNA testing should not be used in lieu of a tissue diagnosis and is generally not 
recommended in settings other than advanced/metastatic disease. However, NCCN also suggests that the use of cell-
free/circulating tumor DNA testing (using clinically validated tests) can be used in certain clinical circumstances, including 
the following: 
 The patient is medically unfit for invasive tissue sampling.

 There is insufficient tumor tissue available for molecular analysis; however, cell-free/circulating tumor DNA should be 
followed by tissue-based analysis when an oncogenic driver is not identified. 
 
In addition, peripheral blood testing (most commonly using plasma-based testing of ctDNA) can be performed in 
conjunction with tissue-based testing in order to accomplish the necessary genotyping for recommended biomarkers. 
Concurrent testing can improve turnaround time for results and should be considered in appropriate clinical 
circumstances. 
 
Prostate Cancer 
Genomic Prostate Score Assay (GPS) (Formerly Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate 
Score), Decipher, Prolaris, and Promark 
In a 2024 meta-analysis, Cui et al. (included in the 2024 Hayes Genomic Prostate Score (Mdxhealth Inc.) for Lower-Risk 
Localized Prostate Cancers Molecular Test Assessment) evaluated the prognostic value of the 17-gene Genomic Prostate 
Score (GPS) test in 1962 individuals with clinically localized prostate cancer (PCa). Eight articles based on seven cohort 
studies were included and all were deemed high quality by the reviewers. Follow-up periods ranged from 20 months to 
15.5 years. Five studies reported on the association between GPS scores and distant metastases; the pooled hazard ratio 
(HR) of distant metastases was 5.22 for the high GPS group versus the low GPS group, with no evidence of significant 
heterogeneity among the studies. Further analysis of these five studies revealed that each 20 unit increase in GPS was 
significantly associated with distant metastases (HR 2.99; 95% CI 1.97–4.53). Six studies reported on the relationship 
between GPS and biochemical recurrence (BCR). The pooled HR of BCR was 4.41 (95% CI 2.29–8.49) for the high GPS 
group versus the low GPS group, with significant heterogeneity between studies (I
2 
= 78.4%, p = 0.010). In this analysis, a 
20 unit increase in GPS had a significant association with BCR (HR2.18; 95% CI 1.64–2.89). Subgroup analysis showed 
improved prognostic value per 10-point GPS increase for studies that reported greater than 5 years of follow up. Four 
studies reported results on the relationship between GPS and PCa-specific mortality (PCSM); these showed a pooled HR 
of 3.81 (95% CI 1.74–8.33) for the high GPS versus the low GPS group, with no evidence of significant heterogeneity 
between studies. For this analysis, there was, again, a significant association between a 20 unit increase in GPS and 
PCSM (HR 3.14; 95% CI 1.86–5.30). Based on these results, the researchers assert that higher GPS predicts distant 
metastases, BCR and PCSM in individuals with clinically localized PCa. They suggest that use of the GPS test may 
improve accuracy of risk stratification and assist with clinical decision-making in affected individuals and encourage further 
large-scale prospective studies. Studies by Janes et al. (2023), Helfland et al. (2022), Brooks et al. (2021), and Kornberg 
et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in this meta-analysis. 
 
Morgan et al. (2024) published results from a prospective, randomized, controlled cluster-crossover trial (G-MINOR) which 
evaluated the impact of Decipher genomic classifier (GC) results on adjuvant treatment after radical prostatectomy (RP) 
as compared to usual care. The study enrolled 175 participants who underwent testing with GC and 163 participants who 
received usual care (UC). Eligible enrollees had undergone RP within nine months of study enrollment, had pT3-4 disease 
and/or positive surgical margins, and had PSA levels of < 0.1 ng/mL. On average, participants in the GC arm received 
adjuvant treatment 9.7% of the time compared with 8.7% of the time for participants in the UC arm at 18 months after RP 
(0.99% mean difference, 95% CI -7.6%, 9.6%, p = 0.8). Higher GC scores were associated with an increased likelihood of 
adjuvant treatment, but it was not statistically significant (odds ratio [OR] = 1.35 per 0.1 increase in GC score, 95% CI 
0.98–1.85, p = 0.066). Using GC risk groups, a high GC risk was associated with significantly greater odds of receiving 
adjuvant treatment when compared with a low GC score (OR = 6.9, 95% CI 1.8, 26, p = 0.005, adjusted for Cancer of the 
Prostate Risk Assessment [CAPRA] Postsurgical score). Other symptoms, such as patient-reported urinary and sexual 
function did not differ between the two groups. The authors concluded that GC testing impacted adjuvant therapy 
administration when considered with risk categories in the participants’ reports, but the study results did not provide 
sufficient evidence to conclusively support GC testing in the adjuvant treatment setting. In addition, long-term results were 
not measured in this data set as oncologic outcomes were immature. The researchers indicate that long-term follow up 
from this and other studies will address remaining uncertainties regarding whether genomic testing provides meaningful 
benefit and improved outcomes in individuals with PCa. 
 
In an effort to measure the associations between Decipher GC testing results and risk of metastasis and BCR after 
prostate biopsy and RP in a real-world setting, Leapman et al. (2024) performed a retrospective cohort study using a 
newly developed linkage of transcriptomic data from Decipher GC and clinical data obtained from insurance claims, 
pharmacy data, and electronic health records across various payors and sites of care. A total of 58,935 subjects who had 
undergone Decipher GC testing were included; 33,379 individual samples were from biopsies and 25,556 samples were 
from RP. Median GC score was 0.43 in the group whose tests were biopsy-based and 0.54 in the group whose tests were 
RP-based. The researchers found that the Decipher GC was independently associated with risk of metastasis in both the 
biopsy group and the RP group after adjusting for baseline clinical and pathologic risk factors. Decipher GC was also 
associated with risk of BCR in the RP group in models that were adjusted for age and CAPRA scores. Based on these

findings, the authors concluded that their results support the prognostic validity of the Decipher GC across varying clinical 
populations and settings. Noted limitations include the retrospective study design and use of real-world data as well as the 
lack of control and comparator groups and limited follow-up time periods. There was also potential for bias, as several 
study authors had affiliations with the GC test manufacturer. 
 
In a 2024 Molecular Test Assessment, Hayes evaluated the clinical validity and utility of the Genomic Prostate Score 
(GPS) test for guiding treatment choice between active surveillance or more aggressive treatments in individuals with 
untreated, lower risk localized PCa. Hayes concluded that the overall body of evidence is very low-quality and insufficient 
to draw conclusions regarding use of the GPS assay for assisting with treatment decisions in these individuals. Overall, 
the evidence suggests that the GPS assay may be a useful tool for informing management decisions, but evidence for its 
accuracy in lower-risk populations is limited, and it is not clear whether GPS-influenced management decisions resulted in 
more favorable outcomes for these individuals. Limited evidence suggests that GPS assay can predict adverse pathology 
at radical prostatectomy and can help direct decisions in terms of treatment intensity and active surveillance. Evidence 
comparing GPS to other risk stratification tools is also limited; the additive use of GPS may improve upon the CAPRA risk 
stratification tool, but not NCCN risk group stratification, for predicting adverse pathology. Finally, evidence focused on 
whether GPS testing generally leads to increased or decreased treatment intensity and whether any treatment decisions 
based on GPS testing are appropriate and beneficial for the patient is conflicting (Hayes, Genomic Prostate Score 
(Mdxhealth Inc.) for Lower-Risk Localized Prostate Cancers). 
 
In another 2024 Molecular Test Assessment, Hayes evaluated the clinical validity and utility of the GPS for informing 
treatment intensity in individuals with untreated, localized PCa meeting NCCN unfavorable intermediate-risk or high-risk 
criteria. Hayes identified an overall low-quality body of evidence which provided insufficient data upon which to draw 
conclusions for this population. While some evidence suggests that the GPS assay may predict risk of PCa recurrence, 
metastasis, and death in individuals with higher risk localized disease and potentially inform treatment decisions, the 
overall body of evidence is small with limited comparisons to other risk prediction models. No studies evaluated the impact 
of the testing on health outcomes of affected individuals (Hayes, Genomic Prostate Score (Mdxhealth Inc.) for Higher-Risk 
Prostate Cancers). 
 
Boyer et al. (2024) conducted a systematic review to evaluate the prognostic capability of three GCs; Decipher, GPS, and 
Prolaris, for biochemical recurrence, development of metastases, and PCa-specific mortality in individuals with localized 
PCa. All subjects had been treated with definitive surgery and/or radiation. The prognostic ability of the three GCs for 
clinical outcomes was compared to standard clinical risk stratification models. Thirty-nine studies comprising over 10,000 
individuals were included. The results of the review revealed that each of the three GCs showed a slightly improved 
prognostic ability for biochemical recurrence, development of metastatic disease, and PCa-specific mortality in 
comparison with commonly used risk-classification methods. However, the certainty of evidence was low to very low; this 
was predominantly due to bias related to the retrospective nature of 37 of the 39 studies, heterogeneity in treatments 
received, and the time period in which subjects were treated (before the 2000s; detection and management of PCa has 
advanced significantly since this time). In addition, the risk classification models used as comparators to the GS results 
were not consistent across the studies reviewed. Nevertheless, the authors concluded that based on the overall results, 
GCs do provide a small but consistent improvement on the predictive ability of standard risk stratification models, which 
could influence treatment decisions when there is uncertainty regarding the best option(s) for treatment. They recommend 
further analysis with more up-to-date data. Of note, multiple studies included in the systematic review were sponsored or 
co-authored by companies with rights to the GC tests. Publications by Brooks et al. (2021), Kornberg et al. (2019), Berlin 
et al. (2019), Klein et al. (2016), and Glass et al. (2016), previously discussed in this policy, were included in this 
systematic review. 
 
Hayes addressed the Decipher Prostate Biopsy GC as well as the Decipher Prostate RP GC in separate 2024 Molecular 
Test Assessments. For the Prostate Biopsy GC, Hayes identified a very low-quality body of evidence limiting the ability to 
draw conclusions regarding the use of this test. The Prostate Biopsy GC uses whole transcriptome analysis to evaluate 
the expression of 22 genes from biopsy tissue samples and was designed to determine risk of adverse outcomes and/or 
assist with treatment decision-making in individuals with localized PCa. Although evidence has shown that a higher 
Decipher score is associated with a greater risk of metastatic disease in individuals with primarily intermediate- to high-
risk cancer as classified per NCCN guideline, questions remain about overall test performance and impact to clinical 
outcomes. Additional research in NCCN lower-risk groups is needed; it is not clear if this testing changes clinical 
management or clinical outcomes in these groups. There is little evidence for superior performance of the Decipher 
Biopsy GC when compared to standard non-genomic methods of risk stratification, such as NCCN risk groups. Regarding 
the Decipher Prostate RP GC, which is used to predict risk of metastasis or PCSM in individuals whose PCa has been 
treated with radical prostatectomy (RP), Hayes found some low quality evidence supporting the usefulness of this test to 
assist with decision-making for post-RP adjuvant treatments, but the evidence was insufficient to ascertain whether the 
testing improves long-term outcomes. Evidence comparing the performance of the Decipher RP to other risk-calculating

tools as well as evidence addressing optimal selection of individuals for testing was found to be inadequate, especially for 
individuals who have undergone RP but had no preoperative high-risk features. 
 
In a 2023 systematic review, Spohn et al. explored the evidence on the use GCs for individuals treated with radiation 
therapy (RT) and conducted a survey of experts using the Delphi method to address the role of GC use in personalized 
treatments for the purposes of identifying areas of future clinical research. Initially, a total of 26 studies met inclusion 
criteria and were sent to a multidisciplinary, international team of experts for review. An updated literature search was 
performed during the peer-review process time period and an additional 5 studies were identified and sent to the 
reviewers, for a total of 31. Ongoing clinical trials were also screened and nine studies on GCs use with RT were identified 
and shared with the expert reviewers as well. There were two rounds of questions; 31 experts completed the first round 
and 30 completed the second round. When survey results showed ≥ 75% agreement, the question/response was 
considered relative and included in the qualitative synthesis. The majority of the studies (65%) focused on the Decipher 
test. The researchers found that the evidence for GCs as predictive biomarkers is primarily focused on the postoperative 
RT setting, although validation of GCs as prognostic markers in the definitive RT setting is emerging. The experts 
surveyed used GCs in individuals with extensively metastatic PCa (30%), in the postoperative setting (27%), and in newly 
diagnosed PCa (23%). Of the experts surveyed, 47% do not use GCs in their clinical practice, although the consensus of 
the experts was that GCs are indeed promising tools for risk-stratification in individuals with primary and oligo-/metastatic 
PCa in addition to existing classifications. The experts also felt that GCs have potential for use in guiding treatment 
decisions for RT-field definition and intensification/deintensification over various stages of disease. The study authors 
postulate that the outcome of this study confirms 1) the value of GCs and 2) the promising evidence that is emerging 
regarding the utility of GC with respect to RT. The authors recommend ongoing study of GCs as prognostic biomarkers 
and the predictive ability of GCs for optimization of RT and/or systemic therapy and await the results of prospective 
clinical trials focused on the role of GCs in the setting of RT which may help to validate the role of GCs for guiding 
personalized cancer treatment. Publications by Janes et al. (2023), Marascio et al. (2020), and Berlin et al. (2019), 
previously discussed in this policy, were included in the Spohn et al. systematic review.  
 
Participants enrolled in NRG Oncology/RTOG 01-26, a randomized phase three trial, comprised the population of an 
analysis by Spratt et al. (2023, included in the Hayes Decipher Prostate Biopsy Genomic Classifier Molecular Test 
Assessment above) investigating the performance of the 22-gene Decipher GC in individuals with intermediate-risk PCa. 
This study is the first validation of a biopsy-based gene expression classifier (GEC) that evaluates both prognostic and 
predictive value using data from a randomized, phase three clinical trial of individuals with intermediate risk PCa. The 
NRG Oncology/RTOG 01-26 trial randomized these individuals to 70.2 Gy versus 79.2 Gy of radiation therapy with no 
androgen deprivation therapy. With NCI approval, biopsy slides from NRG Oncology/RTOG 01-26 were obtained and 
RNA was extracted from the highest-grade tumor foci to generate a locked 22-gene GC model. A total of 215 individual 
samples met quality control standards and were analyzed. The median follow up time was 12.8 years. The primary 
outcome for this ancillary study was progression of disease, using a composite of biochemical failure, local failure, distant 
metastases, PCa-specific mortality, and use of salvage therapy. Using multivariable analysis, the 22-gene GC was 
independently prognostic for disease progression (sub distribution hazard ratio [sHR], 1.12; 95% confidence interval [CI], 
1.00-1.26; p = .04), biochemical failure (sHR, 1.22; 95% CI, 1.10-1.37; p < .001), distant metastasis (sHR, 1.28; 95% CI, 
1.06-1.55; p = .01), and PCa-specific mortality (sHR, 1.45; 95% CI, 1.20-1.76; p <. 001). In participants with GC low-risk 
results, ten-year distant metastasis was 4% compared with 16% in GC high-risk results. The authors contend that the 22-
gene Decipher GC improves risk stratification and can help inform treatment decisions in individuals with intermediate-risk 
disease. A limitation of this study was the limited availability of sufficient quality tissue samples which impacted the power 
of the study and prohibited well-powered subset analyses.  
 
To further evaluate the association between the Oncotype DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) and final pathology 
(including extraprostatic extension [EPE], positive surgical margin [PSM] and seminal vesicle invasion [SVI]), a 
retrospective analysis of 749 individuals who had undergone Oncotype DX testing was performed by Covas Moschovas et 
al. (2022, included in Hayes 2024 Molecular Test Assessment for GPS for Lower-Risk Localized Prostate Cancers). After 
testing, the participants had robotic RP performed by the same surgeon. In odds ratio assessment with multivariable 
analyses per 20-point GPS change, GPS was an independent predictor of EPE (OR 1.8, 95% CI 1.4-2.3) and SVI (OR 
2.1, 95% CI 1.3-3.4). Furthermore, percentage of cases with EPE and SVI increased with GPS quartile when they were 
grouped by quartile. Based on these results, the authors assert that the Oncotype DX GPS is significantly associated with 
adverse pathology after RP, noting that the risk of EPE and SVI will increase with the GPS, and contend that the use of 
Oncotype DX GPS may help providers improve preoperative counseling and implement surgical plans for individuals with 
greater risk of EPE or other negative pathology. 
 
In a 2021 systematic review, Jairath et al. evaluated the available evidence supporting clinical utility of the Decipher 
genomic classifier (GC.) A total of 144 studies were identified and of those, 42 studies including 30,407 individuals met 
inclusion criteria for this review with GC performance data available for localized, post-prostatectomy, nonmetastatic

castration-resistant and metastatic hormone-sensitive PCa. Participants were part of retrospective studies (n = 12,141), 
prospective registries (17,053) and prospective and post hoc randomized trial analyses (n = 1213). On multivariate 
analysis, 32 studies showed that GC was independently prognostic for study endpoints including biochemical failure, 
metastasis, adverse pathology, and both cancer-specific and overall survival. In 24 studies, GC improve discrimination 
over standard of care and in five studies, GC changed clinical management in the settings of active surveillance and post-
prostatectomy. The strength of the evidence was found to be levels 1 and 2 as per Simon criteria for all disease states 
except high-risk PCa and was found to be grade A and B by American Urological Association (AUA) criteria, depending 
on state of disease. Based on this review, the authors assert that consistent data has emerged from diverse levels of 
evidence and when evaluated overall, clinical utility of the Decipher GC has been demonstrated. Utility is strongest for 
intermediate-risk PCa and postprostatectomy use in clinical decision-making. Publications by Marascio et al. (2020), 
Berlin et al. (2019), Kim et al. (2019), Klein et al. (2016), Glass et al. (2016), and Marrone et al. (2015), previously 
discussed in this policy, were included in this systematic review. 
 
Feng et al. (included in the Hayes 2024 Decipher Prostate RP Genomic Classifier Molecular Test Assessment, the 2023 
Spohn et al. systematic review, and the 2024 Boyer et al. systematic review, all above) performed an ancillary study to 
validate the Decipher GC in men who received salvage radiation for elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) after surgery 
in the context of a phase three randomized trial (2021). They used specimens from the placebo-controlled, phase three 
NRG/RTOG 9601 clinical trial and extracted RNA from the highest-grade tumor tissue available in 2019 (NRG/RTOG 
9601 was conducted 1998-2003). Median follow up time was 13 years. GC scores were assigned (0-1) to whole 
transcriptomes and the predictive ability of GC for distant metastasis was evaluated. Additional outcomes including PCa-
specific mortality (PCSM) and overall survival (OS) were also measured. The authors analyzed GC scores from 352 
randomized participants who met quality-controlled inclusion criteria. The GC was found to have an association with 
distant metastasis (hazard ratio [HR], 1.17; 95% CI, 1.05-1.32; p = .006), PCSM (HR, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.20-1.63; p < .001) 
and OS (HR, 1.17; 95% CI, 1.06-1.29; p = .002) after adjusting for Gleason score, T stage, margin status, age, 
race/ethnicity, entry PSA and treatment arm, suggesting that not all men with biochemically recurrent cancer after surgical 
intervention will benefit equally from addition of hormone therapy to salvage radiotherapy. The researchers propose that 
the Decipher GC may hold promise for risk stratification and treatment decisions involving hormone therapy for PCa 
recurrence after surgery. Noted study challenges include the limited availability of samples from NRG/RTOG 9601 and 
ability of available samples to meet quality control requirements (22.4% of total trial samples did not pass quality control), 
as the median age of tissue samples was older than 20 years.  
 
Decipher Biopsy testing was used in a multi-institutional study of 855 men newly diagnosed with PCa between February 
2015 and October 2019. Vince et al. (2021, included in the Hayes 2024 Molecular Test Assessment for the Decipher 
Prostate Biopsy Genomic Classifier [Veracyte Inc.], and the Boyer et al. 2024 systematic review) sought to assess the 
clinical utility of this test in individuals with localized PCa. Participants were tracked through the prospective Michigan 
Urological Surgery Improvement Collaborative and were linked to the Decipher Genomics Resource Information 
Database. An independent third party performed patient matching using two or more unique identifiers. Of the 855 men in 
the study, 264 participated in active surveillance and 454 went on to radical therapy. In the men that elected active 
surveillance, after adjustment for NCCN risk group, PSA, prostate volume, body mass index, percent positive cores and 
age, a high risk Decipher score was independently associated with shorter time to treatment. This was true for participants 
who underwent radical therapy as well; high risk Decipher score was independently associated with a shorter time to 
failure of treatment. The authors concluded that in this prospective statewide registry, there was a strong association with 
a high-risk Decipher Biopsy score and conversion from active surveillance to definitive treatment and treatment failure. 
The authors mention a phase three randomized trial NCT04396808 which is estimated to conclude in 2025, and which 
will, in their opinion, provide level one evidence of the clinical impact of Decipher biopsy testing. 
 
In a retrospective, observational study, Morris et al. (2021) compared the predictive ability and clinical utility of the cell 
cycle progression (CCP) GEP test (Prolaris), multiparametric magnetic resonance imaging (mpMRI) with Prostate Imaging 
Reporting and Data Systems (PI-RADS) scoring and clinical/pathological data in individuals with localized PCa, a CCP 
score and an mpMRI PI-RADS v2 score. The study was made up of two cohorts; the first included 156 individuals with 
newly diagnosed PCa (with or without previous negative biopsy) and the second included 66 individuals who had initiated 
active surveillance without CCP testing but then received the test during their active surveillance. Each individual was 
given a combined score using CCP results and UCSF CAPRA score; this was the clinical cell-cycle risk score (CCR). The 
researchers found small but significant correlations between PI-RADS score and CCP (r
s 
= 0.22, p = 8.1 x 10-4), CAPRA 
(r
s 
= 0.36, p = 4.8 x 10
-8
), or CCR (r
s 
= 0.37, p = 2.0 £ 10
-8
. This may indicate that a large part of the prognostic information 
identified in the testing performed is independent. PI-RADS score did not prove to be a significant factor for prediction of 
post-radical prostatectomy Gleason score. However, both CCP and CCR were shown to be significant and independent, 
in their predictions regarding active surveillance versus curative treatment in cohort 1 per multivariate analysis. CCR at or 
below the threshold for active surveillance reduced the likelihood of choosing curative treatment overactive surveillance, 
which the authors assert validates the clinical utility of the active surveillance threshold. Overall, the authors state that

their results support CCP as a better tool to predict both tumor grade and management of individuals with PCa than PI-
RADS. They stress the importance of obtaining molecular information from men with newly diagnosed PCa to assess risk 
and determine the best clinical management for the individual. Notably, the majority of the authors associated with this 
study are either employed by or associated with the manufacturer of the test under study. Additional limitations include the 
retrospective nature of the study, cohort sizes, dependence on quality and accuracy of biopsy and the lack of long-term 
outcomes. 
 
Eggener et al. (2019, included in the 2024 Hayes Genomic Prostate Score (Mdxhealth Inc.) for Lower-Risk Localized 
Prostate Cancers Molecular Test Assessment)) performed a multi-center study seeking to validate the 17 gene Oncotype 
DX Genomic Prostate Score (GPS) gene expression assay when used on biopsy tissue to predict adverse pathology in a 
group of 1200 prospectively enrolled individuals with very low-, low-, and favorable intermediate-risk PCa. A prespecified 
sub analysis of GPS from biopsy and its relationship with adverse pathology found on RP was performed on the group of 
participants who immediately proceeded to RP. A total of 114 individuals underwent RP and of those, 40 had adverse 
pathology. In this study, GPS results were shown to be a significant predictor of adverse pathology based on results of 
univariable analysis (odds ratio per 20 GPS units [OR/20 units]: 2.2; 95% CI 1.2-4.1; p = 0.008). Significance persisted 
after adjustments were made for biopsy Gleason score, clinical T-stage and logPSA (OR/20 units: 1.9; 95% CI 1.0-3.8; p 
= .04), or NCCN risk group (OR/20 units: 2.0; 95% CI 1.1-3.7; p = .02). The researchers also evaluated the impact of GPS 
scores on physician and patient attitudes about decision-making related to their management; Decisional Conflict Scores 
improved significantly (from 27 to 14) after GPS testing was performed. Based on the overall results, the authors 
concluded that the GPS assay was confirmed to be an independent predictor of adverse pathology at surgery and was 
also related to a reduction of conflict in terms of decision-making. 
 
In a multicenter, retrospective, observational study, Kaul et al. (2019, included in Hayes, Prolaris Biopsy Test, 2019) 
aimed to evaluate the selection of active surveillance along with the safety and durability of the clinical cell cycle risk 
(CCR) score, which is a combination score of clinical data and molecular data (Prolaris). Individuals with low-risk PCa 
(according to both CCR score (DSM ≤ 3.2%) and NCCN guidelines) who had previously undergone CCP testing during 
the course of their care were tracked. Initial treatment selection (active surveillance vs treatment) and duration of active 
surveillance were evaluated. Adverse events measured were biochemical recurrence and metastasis of disease. Of 664 
individuals with low-risk disease (per CCR score and NCCN guideline), 82.4% (547) chose active surveillance and 17.6% 
underwent definitive treatment ≤ six months after diagnosis. The median follow-up period from biopsy was 2.2 years. Only 
0.4% of the 547 individuals who chose active surveillance experienced an adverse event and two-thirds of the individuals 
remained on active surveillance for more than 3 years. Only markers of tumor aggressiveness showed a significant 
difference between the two groups; individuals who underwent definitive treatment within 6 months of diagnosis had more 
aggressive pathological features than those who chose active surveillance. The authors determined that based on the 
collective data from the study, the use of the CCR score in evaluating PCa risk can safely increase selection of active 
surveillance when compared with the use of only clinical/pathological criteria and potentially allow more individuals to 
avoid unnecessary treatment of PCa and treatment-related side effects. Limitations included the lack of a control group to 
assess active surveillance selection and durability in men who did not receive a CCR score, a relatively short median 
follow-up time and cohort of individuals with low-risk PCa only. In addition, several study authors are employed by or have 
associations with the manufacturer of the test being evaluated in this study, creating the potential for bias. 
 
The Prolaris test for use with biopsy and post-prostatectomy underwent assessment by Hayes in 2019. For the Prolaris 
Biopsy test, Hayes found insufficient evidence to support the analytical and clinical validity of this test to aid in prediction 
of PCa specific mortality and metastasis, and studies supporting clinical utility were limited as well (Hayes, Prolaris Biopsy 
Test [Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc.], 2019, updated 2022). Regarding the use of Prolaris post-prostatectomy for 
determination of biochemical recurrence risk within ten years of prostatectomy, Hayes found minimal evidence of 
analytical validity and preliminary evidence for clinical validity, but no studies that provided evidence for clinical utility of 
Prolaris for post-prostatectomy use (Hayes, Prolaris Post-Prostatectomy [Myriad Genetic Laboratories Inc.], 2019, 
updated 2022). 
 
In an effort to evaluate the current utility of GECs related to management of newly diagnosed PCa, Hu et al. (2018, 
included in Hayes 2024 Decipher Prostate Biopsy Genomic Classifier (Veracyte Inc.) conducted an observational study 
including individuals diagnosed with localized PCa. Three GECs results (Decipher Prostate Biopsy, Oncotype Dx Prostate 
and Prolaris), along with data on how the results were used, were collected to determine practice patterns, predictors of 
the use of GEC and the effect of GEC results on the management of PCa. Using the Michigan Urological Surgery 
Improvement Collaborative registry, the researchers determined that 18.8% of 3,966 individuals newly diagnosed with 
PCa underwent testing with a GEC. The rate of use of GEC varied in individual practice settings from 0% to 93% and 
individuals that that had GEC testing were more likely to have lower prostate specific antigen level, lower Gleason score, 
lower clinical T stage and fewer positive cores (all p < .05). For those individuals with clinically favorable cancer risk, rate 
of active surveillance was significantly different among individuals with GEC results above the threshold (46.2%), those

with a GEC results below the threshold (75.9%) and individuals who did not have GEC testing (57.9%). Based on these 
results, the authors estimate that for every nine individuals with favorable cancer risk that participate in GEC testing, one 
additional individual may be managed with active surveillance. Individuals with favorable-risk PCa whose GEC results 
classified them as low risk were more likely to be managed with active surveillance than those who did not undergo 
testing, per the results of the multivariable analysis (odds ratio, 1.84; p = .006). The researchers concluded that that is 
currently high levels of variability among practices with regard to the use of GEC testing, but for individuals with clinically 
favorable risk, GEC can significantly increase the rate of active surveillance. Additional follow up to help determine 
whether the use of GEC testing should be included in the initial care of individuals with PCa to improve clinical outcomes 
is encouraged. 
 
In a 2015 retrospective study, Cuzick et al. (included in Hayes, Post-Prostatectomy and Prolaris Biopsy Test, 2019 and 
the Boyer et al. 2024 systematic review, above) sought to validate a predefined prognostic score from a test using CCP to 
assist providers in choosing the most appropriate management for individuals with newly diagnosed, localized PCa. Study 
participants included individuals with localized PCa diagnosed using needle biopsy; all individuals were being managed 
conservatively. The primary endpoint of the study was death due to PCa. Validation was done using CCP score 
independently and in a prespecified linear combination with standardly used clinical information (CCR scores). Clinical 
information included baseline PSA, Gleason score, clinical stage, extent of disease and age, which were then combined 
into a sole risk assessment score (CAPRA). An independent validation cohort of 585 individuals, all of whom had full data 
available, made up the study. CCP score hazard ratio was s 2.08 (95% CI [1.76, 2.46], p < 10-13) per one unit change of 
the score in the independent validation. In the multivariate analysis which included CAPRA, CCP score hazard ratio was 
1.76 (95% CI [1.44, 2.14], p < 10-6). In addition, the predefined CCR score was high predictive with a hazard ratio of 2.17 
(95% CI [1.83, 2.57], x2 = 89.0, p < 10-20), thoroughly encompassing all prognostic information. The authors indicate that 
the prognostic value of the CCP score from needle biopsies was confirmed by this study; for individuals being managed 
conservatively, CCP scores were highly prognostic for death from PCa and provided data that was not available based on 
clinical information alone. They indicate that the CCP score can provide useful information for ascertaining which 
individuals with PCa can be safely treated with conservative methods and avoid radical treatment. A limitation of this study 
was that a large number of initial participants were excluded due to quality issues, inadequate tumor available or missing 
clinical data. In addition, all study participants were symptomatic with worse prognoses than contemporary cohorts of 
screen-detected cancers. Thus, the study population is not necessarily representative of current populations of individuals 
with PCa. In addition, for the majority of cases, changes in treatment greater than or equal to six months after diagnosis 
were not recorded. Lastly, several of the authors are employees of or otherwise associated with the test manufacturer, 
which could present risk of bias. 
 
Other Prostate Cancer Assays 
Although many additional genomic panel tests related to screening and stratifying risk in individuals with PCa are 
commercially available, the evidence to support the clinical validity and utility of these tests is currently lacking. 
 
In a Molecular Test Assessment, Hayes found a low-quality body of evidence addressing the clinical benefit of the ExoDx 
Prostate Test, which is proposed for use in individuals ≥ 50 years of age with PSA levels 2 to 10 ng/mL to aid in decision-
making related to initial or repeat prostate biopsy. Although four studies addressing the clinical validity of test were 
reviewed, the evidence indicates low to acceptable ability to detect clinically significant PCa. No studies were found that 
compared ExoDx Prostate’s clinical performance with other PSA derivatives, MRI, or other commercially available similar 
tests. Evidence for clinical utility was insufficient (Hayes, ExoDx Prostate Test [Exosome Diagnostics Inc.], 2023, updated 
2024). 
 
Another Molecular Test Assessment produced by Hayes (2024) focused on Select mdx. This gene expression test 
evaluates HOXC6 and DLX1, along with the reference gene KLK3 via urine sample. This result, combined with clinical risk 
factors such as age, PSA, digital rectal exam result, and prostate volume, leads to a test outcome indicating either an 
increased risk or a very low risk of clinically significant PCa upon biopsy. Hayes identified an overall very low-quality body 
of evidence which was inadequate to reach conclusions regarding the effectiveness of Select mdx testing for the 
prediction of clinically significant PCa risk and for informing clinical decision-making regarding biopsy. Some evidence 
suggests that Select mdx could lead to unnecessary biopsies in lower-risk individuals and comparative evidence was 
inconsistent and insufficient in quantity. Further study is required to clarify test accuracy and substantiate improvement in 
clinical outcomes though use of this test (Hayes, Select mdx [mdxhealth Inc.], 2024.) 
 
Confirm mdx is an additional molecular test used to assess risk for PCa. This test uses tissue from a negative prostate 
biopsy to identify genetic biomarkers which can then be used to help determine if an individual may be ruled out for repeat 
biopsy or if the individual should undergo repeat biopsy or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). In a Molecular Test 
Assessment (Confirm mdx [mdxHealth Inc.], 2024), Hayes found insufficient evidence to support use of Confirm mdx for 
ruling whether repeat biopsy is needed in individuals with prior negative biopsy. Although Confirm mdx appeared to be a

significant predictor of PCa on repeat biopsy while other factors were not, no direct comparisons were performed and 
thus, no conclusions regarding comparative performance can be reached. No identified studies assessed clinical 
outcomes associated with use of Confirm mdx. Additional studies are required to evaluate whether Confirm mdx results in 
improved outcomes in individuals with PCa. 
 
Tosoian et al. (2021) sought to validate an optimal threshold for the use of the MyProstateScore test in ruling out grade 
group ≥ 2 cancer in individuals referred for prostate biopsy. In this study, men who had not yet received prostate biopsy 
provided urine samples prior to biopsy and a MyProstateScore was generated using a model which leverages serum 
prostate specific antigen (PSA), urinary PCa antigen 3 and urinary TMPRSS2: ERG. The study enrolled individuals from 
academic and community settings for an overall population of 1,525 individuals. The researchers found that at a threshold 
of 10, MyProstateScore had 97% sensitivity and 98% negative predictive value for grade group ≥ 2 cancer. The authors 
concluded that MyProstateScore provided exceptional sensitivity and negative predictive value for ruling out grade group 
≥ 2 in a large and pertinent population of individuals referred for prostate biopsy. Study limitations included the use of 
systematic biopsy as a reference standard, as biopsy appears to miss approximately 15-20% of cancers, which would 
include a proportion of grade group ≥ 2 cancers. In addition, not all grade group ≥ 2 cancers will ultimately be clinically 
significant. The authors encourage additional validation studies with longer term outcomes for this group. Furthermore, 
there were no individuals with a history of negative biopsy included in this study and the study was performed without use 
of multiparametric MRI, which is commonly used during diagnosis. Further data is needed to confirm the findings of this 
study and further assess clinical utility. 
 
A prospective, randomized, blinded two-armed clinical utility study was conducted by Tutrone et al. (2020) to evaluate the 
impact of the ExoDx Prostate (IntelliScore) test (EPI) on the decision whether to perform a biopsy in a real-world clinical 
setting. EPI is designed to assess risk for high grade PCa. The study enrolled 1094 participants from 24 urology practices 
and a total of 72 urologists. All participants underwent EPI testing but were randomized into EPI vs Control. Only the EPI 
arm received results for the biopsy. In the EPI group (458) of the participants received negative EPI scores. Of these, 63% 
were recommended to defer biopsy and 74% of those did indeed defer the biopsy. Of those with positive EPI scores, 87% 
were recommended by urologist to proceed with biopsy and 72% of participants complied with that recommendation. 
Ultimately, this led to detection of 305 more high grade PCa in comparison with control group and the researchers 
estimated that 49% fewer high-grade cancers were missed due to deferred biopsy compared to standard of care. Sixty-
eight percent of participating urologists indicated that the EPI influenced their decision regarding biopsy recommendation. 
The authors stated that this was the first report on a PCa biomarker utility study with a blinded control group and felt that 
the study showed that the EPI test influenced decision making regarding prostate biopsy and patient stratification. Despite 
these positive outcomes, there were limitations. In the EPI group, there was a 5.7% assay failure, and in the entire group 
of participants, there was a failure rate of 7.1%. Data is lacking regarding long-term outcomes of the participants who 
deferred biopsy after using EPI, and the large number of testing sites and urologists involved required the use of 
streamlined questionnaires, limiting feedback. Lastly, a small number of participants (< 5%) had undergone pre-biopsy 
MRI, which can help refine biopsy accuracy and provide additional information related to EPI test performance. The 
researchers suggest that future studies could include a larger percentage of individuals with MRI data available. 
 
McKiernan et al. (2018) assessed the performance and utility of ExoDx Prostate IntelliScore (EPI) urine exosome gene 
expression assay versus SOC parameters for discriminating grades of PCa from benign disease. This study compared 
EPI results with biopsy outcomes in men with age ≥ 50 yr. and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) 2–10 ng/ml, scheduled for 
initial prostate biopsy. The results were that in a total of 503 participants with median age of 64 yr., median PSA 5.4 ng/ml, 
14% African American, 70% Caucasian, 53% positive biopsy rate (22% GG1, 17% GG2, and 15% ≥ GG3), EPI was 
superior to SOC with an area under the curve (AUC) 0.70 versus 0.62, respectively, comparable with previously published 
results (n = 519 participants, EPI AUC 0.71). Using a validated cut-point 15.6 would have avoided 26% of unnecessary 
prostate biopsies and 20% of total biopsies, with NPV 89% and missing 7% of ≥ GG2 PCa. Setting a different cut-point 20 
would avoid 40% of unnecessary biopsies and 31% of total biopsies, with NPV 89% and missing 11% of ≥ GG2 PCa. This 
study concluded that EPI has been validated in over 1000 individuals across two prospective validation trials for risk 
stratification of high-grade and low-grade from benign disease. The use of this test may improve identification of 
individuals with higher grade disease and could reduce unnecessary biopsies, although ten percent of PCa cases would 
be missed based on the test characteristics. 
 
A study from McKiernan et al. (2016) evaluated the performance of the EPI urine exosome assay. The study compared 
individuals who received standard of care (SOC) alone to those who received SOC plus this novel exosome assay. SOC 
was defined as PSA levels, age, race, and family history. EPI urine exosome assay is a noninvasive, urinary three-gene 
expression assay that is designed to discriminate high-grade (> Gleason Score 7) from low-grade (Gleason Score 6) and 
benign disease. The researchers compared the urine exosome gene expression assay with biopsy outcomes in 499 
participants with PSA levels of 2 to 20 ng/mL. After this first phase, the derived prognostic score was validated in 1064 
participants that included PCA-free men, 50 years or older, scheduled for an initial or repeated prostate needle biopsy due

to suspicious digital rectal examination (DRE) findings and/or PSA levels (limit range, 2.0-20.0 ng/mL). This study found 
that in 255 men in the training target population (median age 62 years and median PSA level 5.0 ng/mL, and initial 
biopsy), the urine exosome gene expression assay plus SOC was associated with enhanced discrimination between GS7 
or greater and GS6 and benign disease (AUC 0.77 (95% CI, 0.71-0.83) vs SOC AUC 0.66 (95% CI, 0.58-0.72) (p < .001). 
The validation study found that in 519 participants urine exosome gene expression assay plus SOC AUC 0.73 (95% CI, 
0.68-0.77) was superior to SOC AUC 0.63 (95% CI, 0.58-0.68) (p < .001). Using a predefined cut point, 138 of 519 (27%) 
biopsies would have been avoided, missing only 5% of individuals with dominant pattern 4 high-risk GS7 disease. This 
study concluded that the urine exosome gene expression assay was associated with improved identification of individuals 
with higher-grade PCa among men with elevated PSA levels and could reduce the total number of unnecessary biopsies. 
 
In a review of tissue-based genomic biomarkers for PCa, Moschini et al. (2016), report that available genomic assays 
have improved the prognostic ability over clinicopathologic parameters of localized PCa. However, these assays should 
be prospectively applied, or even retrospectively applied to prospective studies, to validate their clinical utility in 
prognostication and even prediction in terms of what treatment should be applied either at a new diagnosis or post-RP.  
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American Association of Clinical Urologists 
In a 2018 position statement endorsed by the Large Urology Group Practice Association (LUGPA), the AACU states that 
they “support the use of tissue-based molecular testing as a component of risk stratification in PCa treatment decision 
making. We also support ongoing research to further refine the prognostic power of these tests.” 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
Eggener et al. (2020) published the recent ASCO guideline on molecular biomarkers in localized PCa and summarized 
the evidence as follows: 
 “Few biomarkers had rigorous testing involving multiple cohorts and only 5 of these tests are commercially available 
currently: Oncotype Dx Prostate, Prolaris, Decipher, Decipher PORTOS, and ProMark. With various degrees of value 
and validation, multiple biomarkers have been shown to refine risk stratification and can be considered for select men 
to improve management decisions. There is a paucity of prospective studies assessing short- and long-term 
outcomes of patients when these markers are integrated into clinical decision making.” 
 
ASCO made four specific recommendations: 
• Commercially available molecular biomarker tests (i.e., Oncotype Dx Prostate, Prolaris, Decipher, and ProMark) may 
be offered in situations in which the assay result, when considered as a whole with routine clinical factors, is likely to 
affect management. Routine ordering of molecular biomarkers is not recommended (Type: Evidence based; Evidence 
quality: Intermediate; Strength of recommendation: Moderate). 
• Any additional molecular biomarkers evaluated do not have sufficient data to be clinically actionable or are not 
commercially available and thus should not be offered (Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: Insufficient; Strength 
of recommendation: Moderate). 
• Consideration of a commercially available molecular biomarker test (e.g., Decipher Genomic Classifier) is 
recommended in situations in which the assay result, when considered as a whole with routine clinical factors, is likely 
to affect management. In the absence of prospective clinical trial data, routine use of genomic biomarkers in the 
postprostatectomy setting to determine adjuvant versus salvage radiation or to initiate systemic therapies should not 
be offered (Type: Evidence based; Evidence quality: Intermediate; Strength of recommendation: Moderate). 
• In men with newly diagnosed PCa eligible for active surveillance, both magnetic resonance imaging and genomics 
intend to identify clinically significant cancers. The Expert Panel endorses their use only in situations in which the 
result, when considered with routine clinical factors, is likely to affect management. This may include, for instance, the 
initial management of men who are potentially eligible for active surveillance, where each of these approaches may 
provide clinically relevant and actionable information. These tests may provide information independent of routine 
clinical parameters and independent of one another (Type: Informal consensus; benefits/harms ratio unknown; 
Evidence quality: Low; Strength of recommendation: Weak). 
 
American Urological Association (AUA)/American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 
The AUA and ASTRO published a three-part updated guideline addressing clinically localized PCa in 2022 (Eastham et 
al.). This guideline was endorsed by the Society for Urologic Oncology (SUO) and provides the following 
recommendations regarding use of genomic testing: 
 Clinicians may use tissue-based genomic biomarkers selectively when added risk stratification has the potential to 
impact clinical decision-making. (Expert Opinion) 

 
Molecular Oncology Testing for Solid Tumor Cancer Diagnosis, Prognosis, and Treatment Decisions Page 37 of 77

 Clinicians should not use tissue-based genomic biomarkers routinely for risk stratification or to assist with clinical 
decision-making (Moderate Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade B). 
 Patient and tumor risk factors should be fully assessed to guide decision regarding offering germline testing which 
would include mutations that are known to be associated with aggressive PCa types or are known to have 
implications for treatment (Expert Opinion). 
 
The guideline further states the use of genomic classifiers (GCs) to improve outcomes in individuals with clinically 
localized PCa has not been validated in high quality, prospective clinical trials to date. This is the reason the AUA/ASTRO 
guideline does not recommend routine use at this time. Existing published data supporting predictive ability of genomic 
classifiers have mostly been based on tissue analysis of radical prostatectomy samples; thus the impact of heterogeneity 
of tissue and under-sampling on the ability to prognosticate with GCs is still uncertain. Accumulating evidence has shown 
that GC scores based on biopsy specimens (specifically Decipher), do correlate with clinical outcomes. 
 
American Urological Association (AUA)/Society for Urologic Oncology (SUO) 
A 2023 AUA/SUO guideline (Wei et al.) includes the following recommendations:  
 “Clinicians may use adjunctive urine or serum markers when further risk stratification would influence the decision 
regarding whether to proceed with biopsy (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C). 
 After a negative biopsy, clinicians may use blood, urine, or tissue-based biomarkers selectively for further risk 
stratification if results are likely to influence the decision regarding repeat biopsy or otherwise substantively change 
the patient’s management. (Conditional Recommendation; Evidence Level: Grade C).” 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN clinical practice guidelines for PCa (NCCN Prostate Cancer, v4.2023) state that Decipher, Oncotype DX Prostate 
(GPS) and Prolaris molecular assays may be considered in men with low or favorable intermediate risk PCa and a life 
expectancy greater than or equal to ten years during initial risk stratification to help guide decision-making regarding 
management. Individuals with unfavorable intermediate and high-risk disease may consider the use of Decipher and 
Prolaris molecular assays. Further, the Decipher test is recommended to inform adjuvant therapy when adverse features 
are found post prostatectomy and can be part of the discussion of risk stratification in patients with PSA persistence or 
recurrence after radical prostatectomy (category 2B evidence). NCCN has deemed the Decipher 22-gene genomic 
classifier an advanced tool with a high level of evidence for use as a GEP test for risk stratification in individuals with 
localized PCa and for use post-RP by NCCN.  
 
The discussion section of the NCCN guideline states “These molecular biomarker tests have been developed with 
extensive industry support, guidance, and involvement, and have been marketed under the less rigorous FDA regulatory 
pathway for biomarkers. Although full assessment of their clinical utility requires prospective randomized clinical trials, 
which are unlikely to be done, the panel believes that patients with low or favorable intermediate disease may consider 
the use of Decipher, Oncotype DX Prostate or Prolaris during initial risk stratification. Patients with unfavorable 
intermediate- and high-risk disease and life expectancy greater than or equal to 10 years may consider the use of 
Decipher or Prolaris. In addition, Decipher may be considered to inform adjuvant treatment if adverse features are found 
after radical prostatectomy and during workup for radical prostatectomy PSA persistence or recurrence  
(category 2B for the latter setting). Future comparative effectiveness research may allow these tests and others like them 
to gain additional evidence regarding their utility for better risk stratification of men with prostate cancer.”  
NCCN categorizes PCa risk groups for clinically localized disease as follows: 
 
Risk Group Clinical/Pathological Features 
Very low 
Has all of the following: 
 cT1c  
 Grade Group 1  
 PSA < 10 ng/mL  
 Fewer than 3 prostate biopsy fragments/cores positive, ≤ 50% cancer in each fragment/core 
 PSA density < 0.15 ng/mL/g 
Low 
Has all of the following but does not qualify for very low-risk: 
 cT1–cT2a  
 Grade Group 1  
 PSA < 10 ng/mL

Risk Group Clinical/Pathological Features 
Intermediate 
Has all of the following: 
 No high-risk group features 
 No very high-risk group features 
 Has one or more intermediate 
risk factors (IRFs): 
o cT2b–cT2c 
o Grade Group 2 or 3 
o PSA 10–20 ng/mL 
Favorable 
intermediate 
Has all of the following: 
 1 IRF  
 Grade Group 1 or 2  
 < 50% biopsy cores positive (e.g., < 6 
of 12 cores) 
Unfavorable 
intermediate 
Has one or more of the following: 
 2 or 3 IRFs  
 Grade Group 3 
 ≥ 50% biopsy cores positive (e.g., ≥ 6 
of 12 cores) 
High 
 Has one or more high-risk features, but does not meet criteria for very high risk:cT3; or 
 Grade Group 4 or Grade Group 5; or  
 PSA > 20 ng/mL 
Very high 
Has at least two of the following:  
 cT3–cT4  
 Grade Group 4 or 5 
 PSA > 40ng/mL 
 
In its 2024 version 2 guideline addressing PCa early detection, the NCCN panel recommends “consideration of biomarker 
tests that have been validated in peer-reviewed, multi-site studies using an independent cohort of pt.” The panel indicates 
that various biomarker tests for improving specificity may be considered, including %fPSA, 4Kscore, Select mdx, ExoDx 
Prostate, PHI, MPS, and IsoPSA before biopsy in those with serum PSA levels of > 3 ng/mL who desire more specificity. 
In addition, PHI, %fPSA, 4Kscore, Confirm mdx, PCA3, MPS, and IsoPSA are also options in individuals thought to be 
higher risk despite a negative prostate biopsy. Validation of these tests in diverse populations has varied and it has not yet 
been determined how they could be optimally used in combination with MRI. The panel also states that no biomarker test 
can be recommended over any other for early PCa detection due to the quality and quantity of evidence available at this 
time and the optimal order of biomarker tests and imaging is unknown. Interpretation of multiple tests in individual patients 
is complex, and results are sometimes contradictory (NCCN Prostate Cancer Early Detection, v2.2024). 
 
Thyroid Cancer/Indeterminate Thyroid Nodules 
Vardarli et al. (2024) conducted a meta-analysis aimed at evaluating the performance of commercial molecular tests for 
thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology (ITN). An electronic search was conducted using PubMed/Medline, Embase, 
and the Cochrane Library, selecting studies that assessed the diagnostic accuracy of the Afirma gene expression 
classifier (GEC), Afirma gene sequencing classifier (GSC), ThyroSeq v2 (TSv2), or ThyroSeq v3 (TSv3) in individuals with 
ITN (Bethesda category III or IV). Statistical analyses were performed using Stata. The study included 53 studies with 
6490 fine needle aspirations (FNAs) and showed pooled estimates of sensitivity at 0.95 and specificity at 0.35. TSv3 
demonstrated the best overall performance, followed by TSv2, GSC, and GEC. GSC had the best rule-out performance, 
while TSv2 was superior for rule-in. The meta-regression analysis identified study design, Bethesda category, and type of 
molecular test as independent factors. The findings suggest that TSv3 has superior molecular diagnostic performance for 
ITN, with GSC and TSv2 excelling in specific diagnostic aspects. Limitations of the analysis included the following: 1) 
many of the included studies had a retrospective design, 2) not all ITNs with benign or negative molecular tests underwent 
surgery, thus the true false-negative rate is unknown, and 3) studies did not include head-to-head comparisons of the 
tests using the same cytological sample. Conducting additional studies with a prospective design, blinding, and surgical 
intervention (including histopathological diagnosis of ITNs) for all individuals undergoing molecular diagnostics would be 
beneficial to ascertain true false-negative results. 
 
In a retrospective study, Potonnier et al. (2024) evaluated the diagnostic accuracy of a next-generation sequencing (NGS) 
panel on thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology (Bethesda III, IV, V). The study included 121 participants with 
cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules whose FNA samples were analyzed using the AmpliSeq cancer NGS panel. 
Results were then compared against final histological diagnoses. The panel's performance for Bethesda III and IV 
nodules revealed a sensitivity of 55.0%, specificity of 76.9%, positive predictive value (PPV) of 37.9%, and negative 
predictive value (NPV) of 87.0%. Although the results were promising, the authors indicate that the NPV was not 
sufficiently high to eliminate the need for diagnostic surgery in cases of indeterminate thyroid nodules. 
 
Kim et al. (2023) conducted a single center RCT designed to determine the rate of delayed operation and false negative 
rate of the Afirma

 v3 in participants with Bethesda III and IV thyroid nodules who underwent thyroid 
biopsy between August 2017 and November 2019. Of 176 indeterminate nodules with negative or benign molecular test 
results, 14 (8%) nodules underwent immediate resection, with no malignancies found on surgical pathology. Nonoperative

management with active surveillance was pursued for 162 (92%) nodules with benign or negative test results. The median 
surveillance was 34 months (range 12-60 months), and 44 participants were lost to follow-up. Of 15 nodules resected 
during surveillance, one malignancy was found (overall false negative rate of 0.6%). This was a 2.7 cm minimally invasive 
Hürthle cell carcinoma that initially tested negative with ThyroSeq v3 and underwent delayed resection due to sonographic 
growth during surveillance. The authors concluded the majority of Bethesda III and IV thyroid nodules with negative or 
benign molecular test results are stable over three years of follow-up. Study limitations include short-term follow-up and 
randomization of participants to either Afirma GSC or ThyroSeq v3 which did not allow for a comparison of both molecular 
tests in the same nodule. The authors suggest longer term studies to verify durability of benign/negative molecular test 
results and to identify the length of time individuals need to remain under surveillance. 
 
In 2022, Lee et al. conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to appraise the diagnostic performance of second-
generation molecular tests in diagnosing thyroid nodules with indeterminate fine-needle aspiration biopsy results. Included 
in the evaluation were 15 studies: seven Afirma GSC, six ThyroSeq v3, and two ThyGeNEXT
®
. Studies on ThyGeNEXT 
were excluded from the meta-analysis due to their small sample sizes. Pooled data for GSC studies on 472 thyroid 
nodules displayed a sensitivity of 96.6 (95% confidence interval: 89.7–98.9%), specificity of 52.9% (23.4–80.5%), PPV of 
63% (51–74%), and NPV of 96% (94–98%). Pooled data for ThyroSeq studies on 530 thyroid nodules presented a 
sensitivity of 95.1% (91.1–97.4%), specificity of 49.6% (29.3–70.1%), PPV of 70% (55–83%), and NPV of 92% (86–97%). 
There was not a statistically significant variance in the diagnostic performances of GSC and ThyroSeq (p-values for 
sensitivity = 0.89, specificity = 0.82, PPV = 0.43, NPV = 0.17). Limitations to the study include the small number of studies 
contained within the meta-analysis, no long-term analysis of the utility of the tests, and only two studies evaluated on 
ThyGeNEXT. The authors concluded from the review that high sensitivity and NPV in GSC and ThyroSeq V3 may help 
rule out malignancy amid thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology results. There was no difference in diagnostic 
performances between the two molecular tests displaying that either test is suitable for the malignancy of thyroid nodules. 
Publications by Livhits et al. (2021) and Endo et al. (2019), previously discussed in this policy, were included in this 
systematic review. 
 
Babazadeh et al. (2022) reported on the clinical utility of Afirma XA testing during two years of clinical use. Afirma XA 
became available in 2018 and assesses 593 genes, including 905 potential variants and 235 fusions. Afirma XA was 
performed on 136 indeterminate nodules (103 of these met inclusion criteria). Forty-three of those had positive Afirma XA 
results, 83.7% of which were follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer on surgical histopathology. Overall PPV among Afirma 
GSC--suspicious indeterminate nodules during the same timeframe was 82.5%, similar to the Afirma XA results. Of the 60 
nodules that tested negative with Afirma XA, 73.3% were follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer on surgical histopathology. 
The authors concluded that the Afirma XA positivity is predictive of follicular cell-derived thyroid cancer with PPV similar to 
that of GSC–suspicious results alone at the institution where the study took place. It is still uncertain whether Afirma XA 
results significantly increase the preoperative risk of malignancy for cytologically indeterminate nodules. More extensive 
studies on variants and fusions associated with varied risks of malignancy are needed. Longer-term data collection of 
Afirma XA results and related clinical variables is principal in standardizing how thyroid cancer specialists should use this 
molecular test. 
 
Hu et al. (2021) investigated molecular findings across a large, real-world cohort of thyroid fine needle aspiration (FNA) 
samples through a retrospective analysis of RNA sequencing data files. Overall, there were a total of 50,644 consecutive 
Bethesda III-VI nodules included. The Afirma GSC, which uses whole transcriptome RNA sequencing to identify thyroid 
nodules as either benign or suspicious, confirmed that 66% of the 48,952 Bethesda III/IV FNA studied were benign. 
Among all Bethesda III/IV FNAs and 76% of Bethesda VI FNAs, the prevalence of BRAF V600E was 2%. Named were 
130 different gene partners and fusions involving NTRK, RET, BRAF, and ALK, primarily prevalent in Bethesda V (10%). 
BRAF and ALK fusions were 81% and 67%, respectively; the PPV of an NTRK or RET fusion for carcinoma or 
noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasm with papillary-like nuclear features was > 95% among small consecutive Bethesda 
III/IV sample cohorts with one of these fusions’ available surgical pathology excision data. The expanded Afirma 
Xpression Atlas (XA) panel identified at least one genomic alteration in 70% of medullary thyroid carcinoma classifier 
positive FNAs, 44% of Bethesda III or IV Afirma GSC suspicious FNAs, 64% of Bethesda V FNAs, and 87% of Bethesda 
VI FNAs. Based on the results of this study, the authors felt the analytical and clinical validity of the Afirma GSC and XA 
assays were confirmed. However, the authors did not correlate the surgical pathology outcome with most of the FNA 
samples described or report surgical histology. There was no central blinded histopathologic review, and there is potential 
selection bias, especially among Bethesda V and VI samples. 
 
A Hayes Molecular Test Assessment found limited but positive evidence supporting the Afirma GSC assay for 
identification of benign thyroid nodules in results deemed indeterminate by cytopathology so that individuals may avoid 
unnecessary surgical intervention. The evidence showed the GSC test has a high sensitivity and NPV, but the specificity 
and PPV varied between studies due to the lack of Afirma benign nodules resected to assess test performance. The 
Hayes report also indicates that the GSC test had better specificity and PPV than the previous version of the test

(Genomic Expression Classifier), however studies could not confirm statistically significant differences in the values due to 
the limited number of resected nodules. Additional studies are required to report the follow up of individuals with Afirma 
benign outcomes, specifically around missed malignancies, to support the test performance. An updated review states the 
current Hayes rating is unlikely to change from the previous annual rating (Hayes, Afirma Genomic Sequencing Classifier 
[Veracyte Inc.], 2021, updated 2024). 
 
Hayes assessed the use of the ThyGeNEXT
®
 and ThyraMIR
®
 tests in a Molecular Test Assessment. The assessment 
uncovered inadequate evidence supporting the use of the ThyGeNEXT and ThyraMIR tests to assist with reclassifying 
thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology (Hayes, ThyGeNEXT and ThyraMIR [Interpace Diagnostics Group Inc.] 2021, 
updated 2022). 
 
A Hayes Molecular Test Assessment addressing the ThyroSeq v3 Genomic Classifier (GC) test indicates that there is a 
very low-quality body of evidence supporting the ability of ThyroSeq v3 to predict malignancy in Bethesda III and IV 
thyroid nodules. Although the test appears to have high sensitivity and NPV, true accuracy is uncertain because there is a 
lack of reference standard testing in the majority of samples, especially when the results are negative. In addition, there 
was insufficient follow-up documented for individuals with ThyroSeq v3 negative results. No studies reporting on the 
improvement of health outcomes related to the use of ThyroSeq v3 were identified. Overall, Hayes found insufficient 
evidence for use of the ThyroSeq v3 GC in preoperative assessment of indeterminate thyroid nodules to measure cancer 
probability or provide prognostic data for clinical management (Hayes, ThyroSeq v3 Genomic Classifier [University of 
Pittsburgh Medical Center and Sonic Healthcare USA], 2023, updated 2024).  
 
In a prospective blinded, multicenter study by Steward et al. (2019, included in the Lee et al. 2022 systematic review and 
the Hayes ThyroSeq v3 Genomic Classifier Molecular Test Assessment above), authors sought to find the diagnostic 
precision of a multigene classifier test (ThyroSeq v3) for cytologically indeterminate thyroid nodules. The study enrolled 
782 individuals with a total of 1013 nodules. Of those, 286 FNA samples from 256 individuals met inclusion criteria and 
underwent molecular analysis with the multigene GC (ThyroSeq v3). The primary outcome of this study was the correct 
separation of benign histopathological nodules from cancer and noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like 
nuclei (NIFTP) in samples with Bethesda III and IV cytology. Of the 286 cytologically indeterminate nodules, 206 (72%) 
were benign, 69 (24%) were malignant, and 11 (4%) were noninvasive follicular thyroid neoplasms with papillary-like 
nuclei (NIFTP). Overall, 257 (90%) nodules (154 Bethesda III, 93 Bethesda IV, and 10 Bethesda V) had informative GC 
analysis, with 61% classified as negative and 39% as positive. The test collectively established a 94% (95% CI, 86%-
98%) sensitivity and 82% (95% CI, 75%-87%) specificity in Bethesda III and IV nodules. With a cancer/NIFTP incidence of 
28%, the NPV) was 97% (95% CI, 93%-99%), and the PPV was 66% (95% CI, 56%-75%). The detected 3% false-
negative rate was comparable to benign cytology; the missed cancers were all low-risk tumors. Between nodules testing 
positive, precise groups of genetic variations had cancer likelihoods fluctuating from 59% to 100%. The authors concluded 
that ThyroSeq v3 showed high sensitivity/NPV and relatively high specificity/PPV, which could eliminate the need for 
diagnostic surgical procedures in up to 82% of all benign thyroid nodules with indeterminate cytology and 61% of 
individuals with Bethesda III to IV indeterminate nodules. The study, however, had limitations; study participants were not 
consecutively enrolled (they were chosen from a larger population undergoing testing), and approximately 20% of the 
original cohort was excluded due to no histological diagnosis. In addition, no ethnicity was reported, and the study 
participants were from centers with significant clinical expertise and well-established thyroid nodule imaging, which limits 
the ability to generalize to larger populations of affected individuals, some of whom may be seen in general practices. 
 
Angell et al. (2019) reported on their clinical and analytical validation of the Afirma XA, which uses whole transcriptome 
RNA-sequencing to detect gene variations and fusions from a panel of over 500 genes in thyroid fine needle aspiration 
(FNA) samples. From the same sample, DNA and RNA were purified using 943 blinded FNAs and multiple methodologies 
were used for comparison, including whole-transcriptome RNA-seq, targeted RNA-seq, and targeted DNA-seq. To define 
performance for fusions between whole transcriptome RNA-seq and targeted RNA-seq, 695 additional blinded FNAs were 
used. Of variants detected in DNA at 5 or 20% variant allele frequency, 74 and 88% were also detected by XA, 
respectively, and XA variant detection was 89% compared to another RNA-based detection method. Analytical validation 
studies showed high intra-plate reproducibility (89%-94%), inter-plate reproducibility (86–91%), and inter-lab accuracy 
(90%). Multiple variants and fusions formerly described across the spectrum of thyroid cancers were identified by XA, 
some of which have approved or investigational targeted therapies. The sensitivity of XA as a standalone test was 49% in 
190 Bethesda III/IV nodules. Limitations of measuring variants in expressed RNA were identified, including the fact that 
some variants and fusions that were identified by an alternative method were not identified by XA; the researchers were 
not able to determine the reason for the difference, nor which tests was “correct.” The authors concluded that the data 
from this study supports the clinical and analytical validity of XA for GSC suspicious or for Bethesda V/VI nodules. The 
asserted that XA may also enhance genomic insight when the Afirma GSC is used first for Bethesda III/IV nodules as a 
rule-out test and results are GSC suspicious and may ultimately help to inform personalized clinical decision-making in 
individuals with thyroid nodules and thyroid cancer. Further studies addressing the clinical utility of this test are needed.

MicroRNAs (miRNA) are small noncoding RNAs that regulate gene expression. Research has demonstrated that a 
number of miRNAs are differentially expressed between benign and malignant thyroid nodules which have led to the 
development of miRNA based diagnostic lab tests, and in some cases, labs may offer miRNA testing in conjunction with 
gene variant and expression analysis. Wylie et al. (2016) conducted a study examining genetic variant and miRNA 
analysis on archived pathology samples from the University of Michigan. The samples consisted of an initial set of 235 
aspirates representing 118 nodules with benign cytology, including 13 with surgical outcome (12 benign, 1 malignant), 73 
with malignant cytology, including 51 with surgical outcome (1 benign, 50 malignant), and 44 with indeterminate cytology, 
all with available surgical outcome. The second set of aspirates consisted of 42 distinct nodules with indeterminate 
cytology and surgical outcome. Thirty-one miRNAs were analyzed as well as 17 genetic alterations in the BRAF, RAS, 
RET and PAX8 genes, considered standard mutation testing. Furthermore, 54 samples that were negative by the 17‐
mutation panel were interrogated using a miRNA classification algorithm, commercially available as the ThyraMIR Thyroid 
miRNA Classifier, which analyzes in parallel 20 genes through next generation sequencing and 46 messenger RNA 
(mRNA transcripts). The authors found that standard mutation testing alone had a sensitivity of 61%, consistent with the 
literature. Machine learning was utilized to group miRNA analysis into two groups of miRNAs, classifier A and classifier B. 
When miRNA classifier A was included in the analysis, the sensitivity rose to 78%, and 94% with classifier B. The authors 
calculated that this leads to a low residual risk of cancer (8%) among specimens negative by mutation and miRNA testing 
and corresponds to a calculated improvement from 78–90% NPV to 94–98% NPV at 20–40% cancer prevalence. These 
results contributed to the development of ThyraMIR. In the small cohort that underwent evaluation by ThyraMIR, the 
authors report a diagnostic sensitivity of 85% and specificity of 95%. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American Thyroid Association (ATA) 
The ATA (Bible et al., 2021) developed a guideline for anaplastic thyroid cancer (ATC) which indicates that no genetic 
alterations found in ATC are specific for ATC. However, in specific situations, molecular testing may aid with 
histopathologic diagnosis, which remains the gold standard. Genomic profiling of tumor tissue alone is not sufficient for 
diagnosing ATC, but the results of this testing may be helpful in differential diagnosis. 
 
In a guideline on the clinical management of thyroid nodules, Haugen et al. (2016) provide the following recommendations 
regarding the use of molecular profiling: 
 Nondiagnostic cytology: Some studies suggests that use of a thyroid core needle biopsy with BRAF testing, a gene 
panel, or a gene expression analysis may provide clinical guidance in these cases, but the full clinical impact of these 
approaches for nodules with nondiagnostic cytology remains unknown. If molecular testing is being considered, 
patients should be counseled regarding the potential benefits and limitations of testing and about the possible 
uncertainties in the therapeutic and long-term clinical implications of results. 
 Atypia of Undetermined Significance/Follicular Lesion of Undetermined Significance (AUS/FLUS): Investigations such 
as repeat FNA or molecular testing may be used to supplement malignancy risk assessment in lieu of proceeding 
directly with a strategy of either surveillance or diagnostic surgery. Informed patient preference and feasibility should 
be considered in clinical decision-making. The authors reviewed available data for multi-gene panels of BRAF, NRAS, 
HRAS, and KRAS point mutations, as well as RET/PTC1 and RET/PTC3, with or without PAX8/PPARγ 
rearrangements, and a mRNA expression profile of 167 genes, and concluded that more data was needed to fully 
understand how such tests can impact clinical management. They conclude that there is currently no single optimal 
molecular test that can definitively rule in or rule out malignancy in all cases of indeterminate cytology. 
 Follicular Neoplasm/Suspicious for Follicular Neoplasm Cytology: After consideration of clinical and sonographic 
features, molecular testing may be used to supplement malignancy risk assessment data in lieu of proceeding directly 
with surgery.  
 Suspicious for Malignant Cytology: After consideration of clinical and sonographic features, mutational testing for 
BRAF or the seven-gene mutation marker panel (BRAF, RAS, RET/PTC, PAX8/PPARγ) may be considered in 
nodules with SUSP cytology if such data would be expected to alter surgical decision-making. Molecular testing using 
the 167 GEC has a PPV that is similar to cytology alone (76%) and a NPV of 85% and it is therefore not indicated in 
patients with this cytological diagnosis. 
 Malignant cytology: While studies have been presented in the literature that suggest that BRAF and other multi-gene 
panels may be useful in prognosis and treatment decisions, more studies are needed to establish the impact of 
molecular profiling involving multiple mutations or other genetic alterations on clinical management of individuals with 
primary thyroid medullary cancer. 
 Post-operative radioiodine (RAI) therapy: Molecular testing to guide postoperative RAI use is not recommended at this 
time.

American Association of Endocrine Surgeons (AAES) 
The AAES (Patel et al., 2020) published evidence-based recommendations to aid clinicians in the optimal surgical 
management of thyroid disease, including the following statements which address molecular testing: 
 If thyroidectomy is preferred for clinical reasons, then molecular testing is unnecessary (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence). 
 When the need for thyroidectomy is unclear after consideration of clinical, imaging, and cytologic features molecular 
testing may be considered as a diagnostic adjunct for cytologically indeterminate nodules (strong recommendation, 
moderate-quality evidence). 
 Accuracy of molecular testing relies on institutional malignancy rates and should be locally examined for optimal 
extrapolation of results to thyroid cancer risk (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
 For nodules that are cytologically categorized as Bethesda III, clinical factors, radiological features, and patient 
preference should inform decision-making regarding whether or not to proceed with repeat biopsy, molecular testing, 
diagnostic thyroidectomy, or observation (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
 Diagnostic thyroidectomy and/or molecular testing are accepted options for individuals with nodules cytologically 
categorized as Bethesda IV (strong recommendation, moderate-quality evidence). 
American Association of Clinical Endocrinology/American College of Endocrinology/ 
Associazione Medici Endocrinologi (AACE/ACE/AME) 
The AACE/ACE/AME updated their guidelines on the management of thyroid nodules in 2016 (Gharib et al., 2016). They 
state that molecular profiling should be considered in nodules with indeterminate cytology, and not in those who are found 
to be clearly benign or malignant. They favor profiles that include BRAF, RET/PTC, PAX8/PPARG and RAS mutations. 
They find that there is insufficient evidence either for or against GECs. There is insufficient evidence to use molecular 
profiling to determine the extent of surgical interventions, or for use with low-risk indeterminate cytology cases. 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
The 2024 NCCN guidelines for thyroid carcinoma indicate that molecular diagnostics may be helpful to reclassify follicular 
lesions as more/less likely to be benign or malignant based on genetic profile. In addition, molecular testing may be useful 
for diagnosis of medullary thyroid cancer due to the difficulty of reaching a specific diagnosis with cytology in limited 
samples. Although past studies have shown that molecular diagnostics do not perform well for oncocytic carcinoma, 
formerly known as Hürthle cell neoplasms, modern genomic classifiers are promising with regard to these specimens. A 
requirement for the diagnosis of oncocytic carcinoma and follicular carcinomas is evidence of either vascular or capsular 
invasion, which fine needle aspiration cannot determine; use of molecular diagnostics may be considered in these 
situations but should be interpreted with caution and used in conjunction with individualized clinical, radiographic and 
cytologic features. The NCCN panel notes that molecular testing has been shown to have benefit for making targeted 
treatment decisions as well, especially those related to use of drug therapy or clinical trial participation. Some mutations 
may also have prognostic importance. Molecular testing of single genes or a GEC panel test may be considered and 
should be selected by the clinician based on the specific clinical question being asked (NCCN Thyroid Carcinoma, 
v4.2024). 
 
Melanoma 
Cutaneous Melanoma 
Several molecular tests designed to assess severity of disease and risk of recurrence/metastases and assist with clinical 
decision-making regarding the need for biopsy in cases of cutaneous melanoma have been developed. At this time, 
further studies supporting the accuracy and clinical utility of these tests are needed. 
 
In a prospective, multicenter study, Guenther et al. (2025) evaluated the accuracy of the integrated 31-gene expression 
profile (i31-GEP) for sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) in predicting positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) results in 322 
participants with T1-T2 tumors. This study expands on the original DECIDE study results (Yamamoto, 2023, discussed 
below). To ascertain whether incorporation of the i31-GEP into treatment decision-making led to fewer SLNBs, the 
researchers used propensity score-matching from a matched non-overlapping cohort (n = 322) where the i31-GEP was 
not utilized for decision-making regarding SLNB. Study results revealed that no participants with less than five percent 
i31-GEP predicted risk had a positive SLNB (0/35). Use of propensity matching showed an 18.5% reduction in SLNBs 
performed (43.7% vs 62.2%. p < 0.001). The researchers calculated that use of the i31-GEP could have reduced the 
volume of unneeded biopsies in 35/140 participants (25%); they assert that the performance and clinical utility of the i31-
GEP for predicting positivity in SLNs was confirmed by this study and suggest that incorporation of this test into clinical 
decision-making could reduce the rate of SLNB and improve risk-related care of individuals with T1-T2 cutaneous 
melanoma. Noted limitations include the number of participants with SLNB results available; there was not a separate 
cohort for comparing SLNB procedure rates. Participants and physicians were also allowed to choose whether SLNB was

performed with the individual’s preference serving as the greatest influence, which may have introduced variability into 
clinical decision-making. Finally, the manufacturer of the GEP under evaluation provided funding for the study and several 
authors had affiliations with the manufacturer as well, which presents a potential risk of bias. 
 
In an effort to quantify reductions in SLNB related to use of the 31-GEP and then monitor five-year clinical outcomes for 
each 31-GEP subclass, Yamamoto et al. (2023) performed a prospective, multicenter study (DECIDE) which enrolled 193 
subjects with T1-T2 cutaneous melanoma tumors who had been deemed eligible for SLNB by expert physicians. Prior to 
performance of SLNB but after receipt of 31-GEP results, treating providers were queried regarding the clinical and 
pathological factors that influenced their decision regarding SLNB (n = 191). SLNB procedure rates from this study were 
compared to baseline SLNB rates from a contemporary study (Whitman et al., 2021) using the Exact binomial test, and 
logistic regression modeling was then used to pinpoint features associated with the rates of SLNB procedures. Results of 
the analyses showed that 52.4% (100/191) of clinical decisions to abstain from SLNB were impacted by 31-GEP test 
results, and in 70% of these instances (70/100) providers did not move forward with SLNB. Of the 30/100 SLNB that were 
performed in this group, all were negative. In addition, the 31-GEP contributed to 63 (33%) clinical decisions to perform 
SLNB; of these, 58/63 were performed (92.1%). These findings represented a 29.4% reduction of SLNBs completed in 
participants with Class 1A results when compared to the baseline rate of 78% (p < .01). In total, clinical decisions related 
to SLNB were impacted by 31-GEP results in 85.3% of cases. The results described led the authors to conclude that the 
31-GEP test may provide clinically relevant information regarding the decision to forego or proceed with SLNB in 
individuals with T1-T2 tumors, which could in turn significantly decrease the rate of SLNB. The study, however, had 
limitations; the researchers did not include tumor location as a question with respect to its influence on SLNB performance 
decisions (previous studies have shown that tumors on the head/neck have lower rates of SLNB) which may have been a 
confounding factor in the analysis. In addition, this assessment did not include outcome data (that data is still accruing). 
The collection of various clinical and pathological data likely varied by site and could have contributed to bias. Lastly, the 
study was funded by Castle Biosciences, the test manufacturer, and several authors had affiliations with this 
manufacturer. 
 
Bailey et al. (2023) conducted a registry study using data from the National Cancer Institutes (NCI) SEER Program to 
assess the effects of the DecisionDx-Melanoma 31-gene expression profile (31-GEP) test on survival outcomes in 
participants diagnosed with cutaneous malignant melanoma (CM). Individuals with stage I-III CM that had a 31-GEP result 
between 2016 and 2018 were associated to data from 17 SEER registries (n = 4687). The ability of the 31-GEP to stratify 
melanoma-specific survival (MSS) and overall survival (OS) were examined using Kaplan-Meier analysis and the log-rank 
test. The outcomes between 31-GEP tested participants were matched to those that did not receive the 31-GEP testing. 
Patients with a 31-GEP class 1A result had higher three-year MSS and OS than participants with a class 1B/2A or class 
2B result (MSS: 99.7% v 97.1% v 89.6%, p < .001; OS: 96.6% v 90.2% v 79.4%, p < .001). A class 2B result was an 
independent predictor of MSS (HR, 7.00; 95% CI, 2.70 to 18.00) and OS (HR, 2.39; 95% CI, 1.54 to 3.70). 31-GEP testing 
was associated with a 29% lower MSS mortality (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.94) and 17% lower overall mortality (HR, 
0.83; 95% CI, 0.70 to 0.99) relative to untested participants. While the clinical use of the test may help providers deliver 
more personalized clinical management decisions for individuals with CM and identify their risk of dying, there were gaps 
and limitations. Study limitations/gaps included the following: mechanism of action related to better outcomes could not be 
identified, limited follow-up since the analysis was restricted to 2016-2018 and lack of data related comorbidities and 
specific treatments. Further robust studies are needed and/or ongoing collaboration with NCI/SEER to identify these gaps. 
 
In a 2023 systematic review (including two Ferris studies [2017, 2018] that were previously discussed in this policy), 
Thomsen et al. attempted to determine the diagnostic accuracy of tape stripping (TS) for detecting cutaneous malignant 
melanoma (MM) in suspicious pigmented skin lesions. Ten studies were included. Sensitivity ranged from 68.8% (95% 
confidence interval [CI] 51.5, 82.1) to 100% (95% CI 91.0, 100). Specificity ranged from 69.1% (95% CI 63.8, 74.0) to 
100% (95% CI 78.5, 100). A pooled analysis of five studies testing the RNA markers LINC00518 and PRAME found a 
sensitivity of 86.9% (95% CI 81.7, 90.8) and a specificity of 82.4% (95% CI 80.8, 83.9). This review had several limitations 
that included: a lack of information related to the characteristics of the study population, lack of histological examination 
for TS lesions, potential risk of overlap of participants and no randomized controlled trials that would determine the 
difference between TS and no-TS in terms of impact to prognosis. The authors indicate that in the studies evaluated, TS 
was used as a supplement to well-established diagnostic methods such as visual inspection, dermoscopy, and clinical 
photography. Since the overall quality of the studies was low, the reliability of sensitivity and specificity is questionable. 
Additional high-quality studies are needed to confirm the diagnostic accuracy of PLA testing in cutaneous malignant 
melanoma. 
 
In their Molecular Test Assessment on the DecisionDX-Melanoma gene expression test, Hayes identified ten studies that 
met the defined criteria for their review. One study reported the reproducibility and technical reliability of the test and 
another reported failure rates for samples submitted from a single center. Seven of the studies focused on the clinical 
validity of the test to inform risk of recurrence or metastasis and the last study assessed the clinical validity of the test to

predict the likelihood of sentinel lymph nodes. They did not identify any studies in peer-reviewed literature that met criteria 
and addressed the clinical utility of the test to improve clinical decision making and patient outcomes. Hayes concluded 
that there was a low-quality body of evidence for the analytical and clinical validity of this test to identify the risk of 
recurrence or metastasis or to predict sentinel lymph node positivity for individuals with American Joint Committee on 
Cancer (AJCC) stage I, II, or III cutaneous melanoma (Hayes, DecisionDx-Melanoma, 2022, updated February 2024).  
 
Ludzik et al. (2022) conducted a retrospective case control study evaluating the use of the pigmented lesion assay (PLA). 
PLA is used to non-invasively detect the presence of three genes associated with melanoma (LINC00518, PRAME, and 
TERT) using adhesive patch testing. Patch testing has the potential to reduce the number of unnecessary biopsies. 
Currently, studies that evaluate the clinical usefulness of this test outside a research setting are lacking. The author’s aim 
in this study was to identify possible barriers that reduce the clinical utility of PLA testing by dermatologists. Data was 
collected from April 2021 to April 2022 from an academic tertiary-level center evaluating a total of 472 lesions. Genetic 
analysis failure for LINC00518 and PRAME occurred in 59 or 12.5% of cases and in 300 lesions or 70.9% of cases for 
TERT. In 38.5% of cases, PLA results were discrepant with histopathology. The additional time associated with PLA use 
independent from the participant’s visit was 10-25 minutes. The authors note that this novel non-invasive PLA test for 
melanoma using an adhesive tape-stripping techniques and gene expression profiling may be a promising technique to 
reduce unnecessary biopsies and optimize the triage of pigmented lesions. Yet, studies evaluating the clinical value, and 
possible limitations of these tests in a real-world setting are limited. With the considerable number of discrepancies 
between PLA test results and histopathology and the number of non-actionable results, the use of this testing remains 
limited. Additional robust studies are needed to confirm the clinical utility of this test and prevent possible mismanagement 
of lesions associated with melanoma. 
 
An Ontario Health Technology Assessment (2021) that evaluated the diagnostic accuracy, clinical utility, and budget 
impact of pigmented lesion assays (PLA) for people with suspected melanoma skin lesions. The systematic review 
included seven studies consisting of six cohort studies (including three Ferris studies [2017, 2018, and 2019] that were 
previously discussed in this policy) and one survey that were conducted in dermatology offices, examining adults (> 18 
years old) with suspected melanoma lesions using the DermTech pigmented lesion assay. The authors stated that the risk 
of bias in the included studies was generally moderate to high, and the quality of evidence was very low. Limitations noted 
in the review included the potential bias from the industry sponsored studies, overestimation of the diagnostic accuracy of 
PLA, the diagnostic accuracy of visual assessment may have been underestimated when compared to published 
literature, and many parameters and assumptions used by the economic analysis were not reported in the study, which 
they stated had potentially serious limitations. They concluded that there was no evidence demonstrating the impact of 
PLA on patient outcomes and that the low-quality evidence for the diagnostic accuracy of PLA remains uncertain when 
compared to visual inspection alone. They also stated that the evidence is uncertain about whether PLA has an impact on 
clinical decision making and that the cost-effectiveness of this test compared with the standard care pathway is also 
uncertain. 
 
Marchetti et al. (2020) completed a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the performance of prognostic gene 
expression profile (GEP) tests in participants with American Joint Committee on Cancer (AJCC) stage I or stage II 
cutaneous melanoma. The review included seven studies with a total of 1450 participants. One study was determined to 
have a moderate risk of bias, and the other six studies were determined to have a high risk of bias. There were 623 
participants with stage I disease and 212 with stage II disease that were tested with DecisionDx-Melanoma. The authors 
found that DecisionDx-Melanoma correctly classified recurrence in 29% of the participants with stage I disease and 82% 
of those with stage II disease. It also found that the test correctly classified 90% with stage I disease and 44% with stage 
II disease among participants without recurrence. When they reviewed the data for MelaGenix, which had 88 participants 
with stage I disease and 245 with stage II disease, they found that the test correctly classified 32% with Stage I disease 
and 76% with stage II disease among those with recurrence. Among those participants tested with MelaGenix, the test 
correctly classified 77% with stage I disease and 43% with stage II disease. Limitations noted by the authors include the 
heterogeneity in study designs and data reporting, the lack of availability of individual participant data, short follow-up and 
significant censoring, the variability in the definitions used for melanoma recurrence, and the risk of bias and quality of the 
evidence. The authors concluded that the prognostic ability of DecisionDx-Melanoma and MelaGenix to predict recurrence 
among participants with localized melanoma varied by AJCC stage and appeared to be poor for participants with stage I 
disease. They recommend more rigorously structured studies be performed to better quantify the association of GEP tests 
with melanoma outcomes and to demonstrate clinical utility. 
 
A 2020 meta-analysis (Greenhaw et al.) reported on the strength of the prognostic value of the 31-gene expression profile 
for cutaneous melanoma. To perform the assessment, meta-analysis was performed on 3 studies that met inclusion 
criteria. Clinical outcome for the 31 gene expression test were compared with the American Joint Committee on Cancer 
Staging. The 31-gene expression profile was able to identify the American Joint Committee on Cancer stage one to three 
categories with a high likelihood for distant metastases and recurrence. When the GEP and sentinel lymph node biopsy

were evaluated in conjunction, sensitivity and negative predictive value related to distant metastasis-free survival both 
improved. The authors concluded that the 31-gene test accurately and consistently identified individuals with melanoma 
who were at increased risk of metastasis, functioned independently of other clinicopathologic factors, and improved 
accuracy of current risk stratification. Several limitations were noted, however. There is a possibility that unpublished 
negative-result studies exist that were not considered in this analysis. The studies included had different designs, which 
could impact the strength of the effect of gene expression profiling due to evolving treatments and population differences. 
Follow up time also varied across the studies, which is a consideration when interpreting overall survival estimates. 
Further studies are needed to evaluate most appropriate follow up and treatment of individuals identified as high-risk via 
the 31-gene expression in conjunction with other clinicopathologic factors. 
 
A Molecular Test Assessment by Hayes (2019, updated 2022) focused on the Pigmented Lesion Assay (PLA) 
(DermTech), a gene expression test that is designed to help rule out melanoma and assist with decision-making regarding 
the need for biopsy. The assessment indicates that the initial evidence on the PLA test suggests that the use of PLA test 
results could inform clinical decision-making with respect to surgical biopsy, thereby reducing the number of benign 
lesions that undergo biopsy in individuals 18 years or older. However, published studies do not address full follow-up of 
individuals with negative results and most studies were retrospective or simulation design. Additional study is needed to 
establish whether the test performance is equivalent or superior to current standard of care methods (Hayes, Pigmented 
Lesion Assay [DermTech], 2019, updated 2022). 
 
Hayes published a Molecular Test Assessment on the myPath Melanoma gene expression test as well. The test is 
intended to be used as an adjunct diagnostic tool to distinguish between benign nevi and malignant melanoma when 
histopathologic results of a patient are not clear. Their assessment included seven studies that consisted of one study 
looking at analytical validity, four studies on clinical validity, and two clinical utility studies. All seven studies were 
assessed to be of very low quality due to small sample sizes, study design, lack of test accuracy measurements, 
questionable study comparators and/or removal of challenging cases for clinical validity. Based on their review, Hayes 
concluded that there was limited evidence that supports the myPath Melanoma test as a diagnostic adjunct tool and that 
the evidence was insufficient to support the use of the test as a guide to manage treatment decisions. They also stated 
that the studies were limited in showing that test results have a positive impact on health outcomes. Hayes recommended 
more studies to evaluate the impact of myPath Melanoma for rare or challenging types of melanoma and on clinical 
practice along with studies that show how the test results are used in conjunction with other clinical information to develop 
a treatment plan (Hayes, myPath Melanoma [previously Myriad Genetics, test sold to Castle Biosciences in 2021] 2018, 
updated 2022). 
 
Zager et al. (2018, included in Hayes DecisionDx-Melanoma Molecular Test Assessment, above) conducted a multi-
center trial of archived primary melanoma tumors from 523 participants, using a 31 gene expression classifier (GEC) to 
classify tumors as Class 1 (low risk) and Class 2 (high risk). The five-year recurrence free survival (RFS) rates for Class 1 
and Class 2 were 88% and 52%, respectively. DMFS were 93% for Class 1 versus 60% for Class 2. The GEC was a 
significant predictor of RFS and DMFS in univariate analysis in addition to with Breslow thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, 
and sentinel lymph node (SLN) status. GEP, tumor thickness and SLN status were significant predictors of RFS and 
DMFS in a multivariate model that also included ulceration and mitotic rate. The authors concluded that the 31 gene GEC 
provided value to prognostication, and more prospective studies are needed. 
 
Ardakani et al. (2017) assessed the ability of CGH to differentiate between melanocytic naevi and melanoma in cases 
where the two-show overlapping histological features. Melanomas are characterized by CNVs, while naevi are normal. 
The team used 19 formalin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) unambiguous naevi and 19 melanomas and tested them 
using a SurePrint G3 Human CGH 8x60K array. CGH was able to differentiate between the naevi and the melanoma in 
95% of cases. One naevus showed two large CNV. The authors concluded that CGH may be a good adjunctive test to 
resolve histologically equivocal melanocytic samples. 
 
Uveal Melanoma 
Miguez et al. (2023) conducted a retrospective analysis to assess and validate the prognostic value of GEP testing in 
individuals with uveal melanoma (UM). To date, no studies predicting metastasis by including tumor size have been 
performed. In this study, the researchers sought to determine the prognostic value of combining tumor size with the GEP 
classification to predict metastases. The results included 337 individuals from three different institutions with 87 
demonstrated metastases. The mean follow-up time was 37.2 (standard deviation [SD], 40.2) months for subjects with 
metastases and 55.0 (SD, 49.3) months for those without metastases. Tumors of larger thickness and GEP class 2 (vs 
class 1) were associated significantly with increased risk of metastasis. Tumor thickness showed better prognostic 
usefulness than GEP classification (Wald statistic, 40.7 and 24.2, respectively). Class 2 tumors with a thickness of 7.0 mm 
or more were associated with increased risk of metastasis than tumors with a thickness of < 7.0 mm (hazard ratio [HR], 
3.23; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.61–6.51), whereas class 1 tumors with a thickness of 9.0 mm or more were

associated with increased risk of metastasis than tumors with a thickness of < 9.0 mm (HR, 2.07; 95% CI, 0.86–4.99). No 
difference in metastasis-free survival (MFS) was found between individuals with class 1A tumors compared with those 
with class 1B tumors (p = .8). Subjects with class 2 tumors showed an observed five-year MFS of 47.5% (95% CI, 36.0%–
62.8%). Study limitations included retrospective design, participants from three different institutions, and likely variation in 
tumor size and biopsy techniques among providers. Despite the limitations, the authors indicated that tumor size was the 
most significant predictor of metastasis; it provided additional prognostic value independent of GEP classification. 
 
Singh et al. (2022) conducted a retrospective ten-year cohort study to assess the accuracy of the predicted MFS rate by a 
GEP test in individuals with UM by comparing the individual’s GEP test results to what they found in their clinics. The 
authors reported that the test predicted worse outcomes for participants with UM than what occurred. The study included 
a retrospective record review of 352 consecutive patients from two clinics with a mean age at diagnosis of 59.4 years 
(+13.0 years) who were followed for a median interval of 38.0 months (19.0 - 57.0 months). All individuals had undergone 
a fine-needle aspiration biopsy GEP test of which, 43% showed class 1A (low risk) UM, 22% showed class 1B 
(intermediate risk) UM, and 35% showed class 2 (high risk) UM. The MFS was specified as time-to-metastasis for those 
who developed metastases, or the last follow-up date was used for those who did not develop metastatic disease. There 
were 48 participants who developed metastasis with 40 who had class 2 tumors, 5 with class 1A tumors and 3 with class 
1B tumors. The authors found that the observed three-year MFS was 93% for all class 1 tumors and 67% for class 2 
tumors while the five-year MFS was 87% for participants with class 1 tumors and 47% for those with class 2 tumors. 
Limitations of this cohort study included its retrospective design, small population size and small number of included study 
sites. The authors concluded that, in general, the MFS was better for smaller than larger tumors and that the predicted 
MFS for class 2 UM tumors appears to be worse than what they found to have actually occurred in the patient population. 
They recommended that future studies include the tumor size in the prediction model to enhance the accuracy of the GEP 
test. 
 
Hayes completed a Molecular Test Assessment addressing the DecisionDx-UM test, a quantitative reverse transcriptase 
PCR-based profiling test intended to identify the likelihood of metastasis within 5 years in patients with UM. The evidence 
base examined in the assessment included one study each on analytical validity, clinical validity, and clinical utility 
(Plasseraud, 2016, discussed below). When reviewed together, the overall quality of the body of evidence was 
determined to be very low due to small sample sizes, short follow-up periods, the sensitivity and linearity of the test, and 
the ambiguity of the role of DecisionDx-UM in physician decisions. Hayes concluded that the evidence was insufficient to 
support the use of the DecisionDx-UM test to identify the likelihood of metastasis within 5 years in patients with UM 
because the validity of the test and the impact on patient management was unclear. The assessment stated that 
additional studies are needed to support the use of this test (Hayes, DecisionDx-UM [Castle Biosciences Inc.], 2020, 
updated 2023). 
 
In a five-year clinical outcome report from a prospective registry of individuals tested with a prognostic 15-gene 
expression profile (15-GEP) test for UM and a meta-analysis with published cohorts, Aaberg et al. (2020) found that 
testing with the 15-GEP test guided management of individuals with UM. UM, a rare intraocular cancer, has a 30-50% risk 
of metastasis within 5 years of diagnosis. The prognostic 15-GEP was designed to predict five-year metastatic risk using 
three risk categories indicating low, intermediate, and high-risk groups. In this study, 89 participants who had undergone 
15-GEP testing were prospectively enrolled at four separate locations. Clinical outcomes and management plans were 
tracked every six months. Eighty percent of class 1 (low-risk) participants received low-intensity management, and all 
class 2 (high-risk) participants received high-intensity management (p < 0.0001). Five-year melanoma survival rates were 
94% for class 1 and 63% for class 2. Five-year metastasis-free survival rates were 90% for class 1 and 41% for class 2. 
By meta-analysis performed on several prior studies to evaluate clinical outcomes of participants tested with15-GEP, 
class 2 was associated with an increased risk for both metastasis and mortality and was also the only independent 
predictor of metastasis.  
 
Klufas et al. (2017) retrospectively reviewed the role of gene expression profile analysis (GEP) vs chromosome 3 specific 
analysis. Records of consecutive patients diagnosed with posterior UM who underwent intraoperative fine needle 
aspiration biopsy prior to placement of an iodine-125 radioactive plaque between 2012 and 2014 were reviewed. Two 
cohorts of participants were identified. Cohort 1 had 44 participants, and tumors had both GEP and FISH analysis. Cohort 
2 had 43 participants, and those tumors had GEP, and multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) results 
were obtained. Discordance between GEP and chromosome 3 status by FISH and MLPA occurred in the series at a rate 
of 15.9 and 16.3%, respectively. The authors concluded that caution must be advised when counseling an individual with 
a good-prognosis GEP "Class 1" result that the uveal tumor may actually harbor monosomy 3, which is associated with a 
poor prognosis for metastasis in nearly 20% of individuals. 
 
Plasseraud et al. (2016, included in the Hayes DecisionDx-UM 2020 Molecular Test Assessment above) evaluated the 
clinical validity and utility of DecisionDx-UM in a prospective, multicenter, study (supported by Castle Biosciences, Inc.).

Seventy participants were enrolled to document management differences and clinical outcomes associated with low-risk 
Class 1 and high-risk Class 2 results indicated by DecisionDx-UM testing. Thirty-seven participants in the prospective 
study were Class 1 and 33 were Class 2. Class 1 patients had 100% three-year metastasis-free survival compared to 
63% for Class 2 (log rank test p = 0.003) with 27.3 median follow-up months in this interim analysis. Class 2 participants 
received significantly higher-intensity monitoring and more oncology/clinical trial referrals compared to Class 1 (Fisher's 
exact test p = 2.1 × 10
-13
 and p = 0.04, respectively). In the authors’ opinion, the results of this study provided additional, 
prospective evidence through an independent cohort of individuals for which Class 1 and Class 2 patients were managed 
according to the differential metastatic risk indicated by DecisionDx-UM. A study limitation is financial sponsorship/support 
by the manufacturer which increases the risk of bias. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American Academy of Dermatology (AAD) 
Guidelines from the AAD, updated in 2019, included recommendations for diagnostic, prognostic, and therapeutic 
molecular testing (Swetter et al., 2019). 
 Ancillary diagnostic molecular techniques (e.g., comparative genomic hybridization; fluorescence in situ hybridization, 
gene expression profiling [GEP]) may be used for equivocal melanocytic neoplasms. 
 Routine molecular testing, including GEP, for prognostication is discouraged until better use criteria are defined. The 
application of molecular information for clinical management (e.g., sentinel lymph node eligibility, follow-up, and/or 
therapeutic choice) is not recommended outside of a clinical study or trial. 
 Testing of the primary cutaneous melanoma for oncogenic mutations (e.g., BRAF, NRAS) is not recommended in the 
absence of metastatic disease. 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Cutaneous Melanoma guidelines (v1.2025) indicate that for diagnostic testing, there is agreement that any 
ancillary testing (e.g., CGH, FISH, GEP, SNP arrays, NGS) to differentiate malignant from benign melanocytic neoplasms 
should be used as an adjunct to clinical and expert dermatopathological examination and that it should be interpreted 
within the context of their findings. 
The guideline further states the following regarding prognostic/predictive testing: 
 “Despite commercially available GEP tests being marketed to risk stratify cutaneous melanomas, current GEP 
platforms do not provide clinically actionable prognostic information when combined or compared with known 
clinicopathologic (CP) factors (e.g., sex, age, primary tumor location, thickness, ulceration, mitotic rate, 
lymphovascular invasion, microsatellites, and/or [sentinel lymph node biopsy] SLNB status). Furthermore, the clinical 
utility of these tests to inform treatment recommendations and improve health outcomes by prompting an intervention 
has not been established. 
 Various studies of prognostic GEP tests suggest their role as an independent predictor of worse outcome. However, 
GEP studies to date have not demonstrated added benefit beyond comprehensive CP variables, and it remains 
unclear whether available GEP tests are reliably predictive of outcome across the risk spectrum of cutaneous 
melanoma. Validation studies on prospectively collected, independent cohorts (similar to those performed in BC) are 
necessary to define the clinical utility of molecular prognostic GEP as an adjunct to AJCC staging and other known 
prognostically significant CP variables or as part of the multidisciplinary decision-making process to guide surveillance 
imaging, SLNB, and adjuvant therapy. 
 Existing and emerging GEP tests and other molecular techniques (i.e., circulating tumor DNA tests) should be 
prospectively compared to determine their clinical utility, including with no-cost, contemporary models that incorporate 
readily available CP variables. Prospective study of the utility of predictive GEP for SLNB risk, in conjunction with well-
established CP factors, is ongoing.” 
 
Regarding non-invasive patch testing for cutaneous melanoma, NCCN indicates that this testing may be helpful to guide 
biopsy decisions for melanocytic neoplasms that are dermoscopically and clinically suspicious for melanoma. 
 
The NCCN Uveal Melanoma guidelines address the staging and management of uveal melanoma, stating that biopsy is 
not usually necessary for the initial diagnosis of uveal melanoma and selection of first line treatment, but it may be helpful 
when there is uncertainty regarding diagnosis and may also provide prognostic information that can help guide follow up. 
Risks/benefits of biopsy for prognostic purposes should be carefully considered and discussed at length.  
 
Molecular/chromosomal testing for prognostic purposes is preferred over cytology alone if biopsy is performed. NCCN 
outlines tumor markers that have been shown to be associated with increased risk or shorter time to development of 
distant metastases and notes the development of gene expression profiling for prognostic purposes, which is 
recommended for stratification if biopsy is performed (NCCN Uveal Melanoma, v1.2024).

Cutaneous Squamous Cell Carcinoma 
Gopal et al. discussed the integration of DecisionDx
®
-SCC, a 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) testing into clinical 
recommendations for adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) in individuals with cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC) in 
their 2024 Multidisciplinary Consensus Guidelines. These guidelines were developed by a panel of experts, including 
radiation oncologists and dermatologists, to enhance the precision of ART recommendations. The 40-GEP test classifies 
individuals into risk categories (Class 1, 2A, and 2B) based on their likelihood of metastasis, providing a more accurate 
prognostic tool compared to traditional clinicopathologic factors alone. The guidelines suggest that incorporating 40-GEP 
testing along with existing staging systems (e.g., AJCC-8) and management guidelines (e.g., NCCN) can better stratify 
individuals' risk and inform decisions regarding ART. This approach aims to improve outcomes by identifying high-risk 
individuals who would benefit most from ART while avoiding unnecessary treatment in lower-risk individual. The proper 
application of 40-GEP testing requires a collaborative decision-making process between the multidisciplinary team and 
the individual with cSCC. This approach takes into account various factors, including the individual’s risk of metastasis, 
the characteristics of both the tumor and surrounding tissues, and the individual's personal preferences. The development 
of this article was funded by the 40-GEP test manufacturer and authors had had affiliations with the manufacturer as well, 
introducing potential risk of bias. 
 
Ruiz et al. (2024) conducted a retrospective validation study evaluating the utility of the 40-GEP test in predicting the 
benefit of adjuvant radiation therapy (ART) for individuals with cSCC. The study focused on cSCC tumors received from 
two academic centers, examining associated five-year metastasis-free survival rates as well as projected time to 
metastasis. In random sampling of matched individual pairs (n = 52 ART-treated; 371 no ART), there was a median 50% 
decrease in five-year progression rate for ART-treated individuals (vs no ART) with 40-GEP Class 2B results. Class 2A 
results were associated with a small ART benefit; no differences were noted between ART treated and untreated tumors 
for participants with Class 1 results. Limitations of the study included the infrequent occurrence of Class 2B results, the 
study’s retrospective design, and the inclusion of only two clinical sites, which may limit generalizability. In addition, the 
study was partially funded by the manufacturer of the GEP test and several authors had affiliations with this this 
manufacturer, introducing potential risk of bias. Despite the limitations, the researchers assert that the study's statistical 
power was adequate due to the significant effect size observed. The authors concluded that in this study, the 40-GEP test 
effectively identified individuals with cSCC who were most likely to benefit from ART as well as those that may consider 
deferring treatment, which validates previously reported benefits of ART for Class 2B tumors and lack of benefit for Class 
1 tumors. 
 
In a 2024 expert panel consensus report, Zakria et al. discuss the integration of a prognostic 40-GEP test into the 
management of cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). The panel, comprised of eight dermatology/cSCC experts, 
reviewed existing literature, and developed guidelines for incorporation of the 40-GEP test into clinical practice. The panel 
unanimously voted to adopt 7 consensus statements and recommendations, 6 of which were given a Strength of 
Recommendation Taxonomy (SORT) Level strength of "A" and 1 of which was given a strength of "C". The authors 
concluded that the 40-GEP test provided accurate and independent prognostic information beyond standard staging 
systems that only incorporate pathologic data and propose that incorporation of GEP testing into national guidelines may 
help further stratify individuals based on risk of metastasis and thereby improve morbidity and mortality. Of note, the study 
was partly funded by, and some of the authors have affiliations with, the manufacturer of the 40-GEP referenced in this 
consensus report. 
 
The use of the 40-GEP test to improve metastatic risk assessment in cSCC was investigated by Ibrahim et al. (2022) in a 
multicenter study (33 sites). The researchers collected data from 420 primary tumors with known clinical outcomes and 
the 40-gene expression profile (40-GEP) test was used along with clinicopathological factors to stratify metastatic risk. 
The findings demonstrated that combining molecular profiling with traditional risk assessments significantly improved 
prognostic accuracy. Specifically, the 40-GEP test helped to better stratify individuals into risk categories, with Class 1 
results showing metastasis rates similar to the general cSCC population and Class 2B results showing metastasis rates 
over 50%. The authors acknowledge potential limitations, such as the archival nature of samples and possible under-
reporting of high-risk factors. This cohort, however, represented a high-risk cSCC population with a 15% metastasis rate 
and reflects current clinical pathology practices. Measures such as comprehensive monitoring and independent 
dermatopathologist review were implemented to mitigate potential under-reporting. Identifying the primary lesion among 
multiple cutaneous lesions was another limitation, but strict inclusion/exclusion criteria were used to address this. Lastly, 
potential for bias exists related to study funding (provided by the manufacturer of the 40-GEP test) and the affiliation of 
some study authors with the manufacturer. The researchers suggest that ongoing research will explore tissue testing from 
recurrent tumors and the use of the 40-GEP to predict risk of local recurrence as well. They propose that further study 
focused on the incorporation of molecular profiling with standard clinicopathologic assessments will ultimately enhance 
individual risk assessment and improve clinical decision-making, ultimately leading to better health outcomes and 
resource use for individuals with cSCC.

Wysong et al. (2021) directed a prospective study to develop and validate a 40-GEP test designed to predict metastatic 
risk in individuals with localized high-risk cutaneous squamous cell carcinoma (cSCC). Conducted across 23 independent 
centers, the study included testing of 586 archival primary cSCC tissue samples. Using a discovery cohort (n = 202), a 
GEP signature was developed; this was validated in a separate independent cohort with no overlap (n = 324). The 40-
GEP test was designed to stratify individuals into three risk classes: Class 1 (low-risk), Class 2A (high-risk), and Class 2B 
(highest-risk). Results showed that the three-year metastasis-free survival (MFS) rates were 91.4% for Class 1 (low risk), 
80.6% for Class 2A (high risk), and 44.0% for Class 2B (highest risk). The test demonstrated a positive predictive value 
(PPV) of 60% for Class 2B, surpassing traditional staging systems. Negative predictive value (NPV), sensitivity, and 
specificity were comparable to currently used staging modalities. The authors state that the 40-GEP test may prove to be 
a valuable tool for improving risk-directed management of individuals with high-risk cSCC. Study limitations include the 
potential under-staging of cases, which could affect metastasis rate accuracy, and risk of bias in specimen collection 
based on tissue availability from archival samples. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
No guidelines specifically discussing the DecisionDx-SCC/40-GEP or use of GEP for risk stratification in individuals with 
cSCC were identified.  
 
Cancers of Unknown Primary (CUP) 
Molecular tests intended to guide site-specific treatments in individuals with CUP have been developed. To date, peer-
reviewed evidence supporting the use of these tests is insufficient. More high-quality studies addressing accuracy of these 
tests and data indicating whether they lead to improved outcomes is required. 
 
In a 2023 prospective study (SUPER), Posner et al. assessed the diagnostic utility of RNA and DNA analysis in 215 
participants with CUP in Australia. A retrospective analysis of clinicopathological information was performed; this revealed 
that 166/215 (77%) of the individuals with CUP did not have sufficient evidence to support a tissue of origin (TOO) 
diagnosis. The remaining participants had either sufficient evidence to support a likely TOO determination (13%), or a 
latent primary diagnosis (10%). Microarray analysis (CUPGuide) and/or a custom NanoString 18-class GEP test was 
performed for 191 CUP specimens and was found to be 91.5% accurate for high-medium confidence predictions in known 
metastatic cancers. In the cases where clinicopathological information resolved CUP, 80% had high-medium predictions 
and 94% agreed with pathology results. Of note, GEP use resulted in high-medium confidence in only 56% of 
clinicopathologically unresolved CUPs. In 201 CUP tumors, diagnostic markers were queried based on the cancer-type 
specific mutations found in 22 cancer types from the AACR Project GENIE database, which houses information on 77,058 
tumors. Mutational signatures related to other factors, such as smoking were also explored. For CUPS unresolved by 
clinicopathological information, assessment of mutations and mutational signatures led to added diagnostic evidence in 
31% of the cases; GEP classification, however, was only useful in 13% of those. Lung and biliary cancer were the most 
frequently identified cancers among CUPs where genomic information assisted with identifying TOO. The researchers 
determined that in this study, DNA and RNA tests help to resolve a third of CUP cases where clinicopathological data 
alone were not enough to establish TOO. While GEP is the most commonly studied molecular diagnostic test for CUP to 
date, this investigation found that DNA sequencing may be of greater diagnostic value, as many tumors appear to have an 
atypical transcriptional profile while maintaining identifiable and important diagnostic mutational features. Though DNA 
mutational profiling is not currently a guideline-recommended approach, the authors propose that the integration of this 
testing in cancer-type assessment and for use in identifying targeted treatments has potential high clinical value. 
 
A study by Wang et al. (2023) sought to evaluate the use of rapid NGS to help identify CUP and associated therapeutic 
biomarkers that could be employed to guide site-specific therapies. Forty solid tumor samples were evaluated based on 
initial diagnosis of CUP and NGS testing was performed using the Oncomine Precision Assay GX. Genomic information 
was used to support a site-specific cancer diagnosis for 6 participants (15%). The most common genetic variations found 
were KRAS (35%), CDKN2A (15%), TP53 (15%), and ERBB2 (12%). Twenty-three individuals had results identifying 
actionable molecular-targeted treatments (variations in BRAF, CDKN2A, ERBB2, FGFR2, IDH1, and KRAS). An 
immunotherapy-sensitizing MMR deficiency was detected in one individual. The authors assert that this study supports 
the integration of rapid NGS into care for individuals diagnosed with CUP and the viability of using genomic profiling along 
with diagnostic histopathology and immunohistochemistry for these individuals. They recommend further study including 
the incorporation of diagnostic algorithms which include genomic profiling to better identify CUP. This study was limited by 
its retrospective design, small population, and analysis performed in a single institution only. In addition, a relatively small 
testing panel was used, which may not have captured some genome-wide biomarkers, and no survival or outcome data 
were evaluated. 
 
Ding et al. (2022) conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies investigating the efficacy of site-specific 
therapy guided by molecular profiling compared to empiric therapy for individuals with CUP. GEP was used to identify the

tissue of origin in this study. Hazard ratios (HRs) for overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) were 
assessed to compare the efficacy of site-specific therapy with empiric therapy in individuals with CUP. In addition, 
subgroup analyses were conducted. Five studies comprising 1114 participants were identified, of which 454 received site-
specific therapy, and 660 received empiric therapy. Our meta-analysis revealed that site-specific therapy was not 
significantly associated with improved PFS (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.74-1.17, p = 0.534) and OS (HR 0.75, 95% CI 0.55-1.03, p 
= 0.069), compared with empiric therapy. However, during subgroup analysis, significantly improved OS was associated 
with site-specific therapy in the high-accuracy predictive assay subgroup (HR 0.46, 95% CI 0.26-0.81, p = 0.008) 
compared with the low accuracy predictive assay subgroup (HR 0.93, 95% CI 0.75-1.15, p = 0.509). Additionally, when 
compared with participants with less responsive tumor types, more survival benefit from site-specific therapy was found in 
participants with more responsive tumors (HR 0.67, 95% CI 0.46-0.97, p = 0.037). The authors concluded that their results 
suggest that site-specific therapy is not significantly associated with improved survival outcomes; however, it might benefit 
individuals with CUP with more responsive tumor types. This is a non-randomized study and is limited due to a 
heterogeneous population. Further investigation is needed before clinical usefulness of this procedure is proven. 
 
Ross et al. (2021) performed a retrospective analysis of CUP origin cases referred for comprehensive genomic profiling 
(CGP) to determine how many were potentially eligible for enrollment into an experimental CUPISCO arm, an ongoing 
randomized trial using CGP to assign individuals with CUP to targeted or immunotherapy treatment arms based on 
genomic profiling (NCT03498521). Centrally reviewed adenocarcinoma and undifferentiated CUP specimens in the 
FoundationCore database were analyzed using the hybrid capture based FoundationOne CDx assay (mean coverage, > 
600×). Presence of genomic alterations, microsatellite instability (MSI), tumor mutational burden (TMB), genomic loss of 
heterozygosity (gLOH), and programmed death-ligand 1 (PD-L1) positivity were determined. A total of 96 of 303 
participants (31.7%) could be matched to an experimental CUPISCO arm. Key genomic alterations included ERBB2 
(7.3%), PIK3CA (6.3%), NF1 (5.6%), NF2 (4.6%), BRAF (4.3%), IDH1 (3.3%), PTEN, FGFR2, EGFR (3.6% each), MET 
(4.3%), CDK6 (3.0%), FBXW7, CDK4 (2.3% each), IDH2, RET, ROS1, NTRK (1.0% each), and ALK (0.7%). Median TMB 
was 3.75 mutations per megabase of DNA; 34 participants (11.6%) had a TMB ≥ 16 mutations per megabase. Three 
participants (1%) had high MSI, and 42 (14%) displayed high PD-L1 expression (tumor proportion score ≥ 50%). gLOH 
could be assessed in 199 of 303 specimens; 19.6% had a score of > 16%. The authors concluded that 32 percent of 
participants would have been eligible for targeted therapy in CUPISCO. Future studies, including additional biomarkers 
such as PD-L1 positivity and gLOH, may identify a greater proportion potentially benefiting from CGP-informed treatment. 
Clinical trial identification number: NCT03498521. The findings of this retrospective analysis of carcinoma of unknown 
primary origin (CUP) cases validate the experimental treatment arms being used in the CUPISCO study (NCT03498521) 
using comprehensive genomic profiling to assign participants with CUP to targeted or immunotherapy treatment arms 
based on the presence of pathogenic genomic alterations. The authors also concluded the findings suggest that future 
studies including additional biomarkers and treatment arms, such as programmed death-ligand 1 positivity and genomic 
loss of heterozygosity, may identify a greater proportion of individuals with CUP potentially benefiting from comprehensive 
genomic profiling-informed treatment. A limitation is that this study lacks detailed clinical data for each specimen, including 
whether any participants received specialized therapy and subsequently demonstrated therapeutic benefit. Further 
research is needed to validate these findings. 
 
Lombardo et al. (2020) conducted a systematic review to describe genes and molecular pathways involved in cancer of 
unknown primary (CUP) pathogenesis and focus on available data of targeted genotype-directed treatment. This 
systematic review consisted of studies of individuals with CUP, whose tumor specimen was evaluated through NGS, 
according to PRISMA criteria from PubMed, ASCO meeting library and Clinicaltrial.gov identifying potentially targetable 
alterations for which approved/off-label/in clinical trials drugs are available. Case reports about individuals with CUP 
treated with targeted therapies driven by NGS results in order to explore the clinical role of NGS in this setting were 
identified. Fifteen publications of which eleven studies (9 full-text articles and 2 abstracts) have analyzed the genomic 
profiling of CUPs through NGS technology, with different platforms and with different cohorts, ranging from 16 to 1,806 
participants were included. Among these studies, 85% of participants demonstrated at least one molecular alteration, the 
most frequent involving TP53 (41.88%), KRAS (18.81%), CDKN2A (8.8%), and PIK3CA (9.3%). A mean of 47.3% of 
participants harbored a potentially targetable alteration for which approved/off-label/in clinical trials drugs were available. 
Four case reports were identified in order to evaluate the clinical relevance of a specific targeted therapy identified 
through NGS. The authors concluded NGS may represent a tool to improve diagnosis and treatment of CUP by identifying 
therapeutically actionable alterations and providing insights into tumor biology. Potential limitations of a tissue-agnostic 
therapeutic approach include that extrapolating therapeutic actionability from one cancer histology to another might 
provide uncertain. Therefore, for individuals with CUP, it would be still important to consider putative primary sites even 
when candidate actionable driver mutations are found. In addition, redundancy in activation of pathways of resistance 
does often take place as a mechanism of primary as well as secondary resistance. Further research is needed to 
determine the clinical relevance of these findings.

A Hayes Molecular Test Assessment report concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw conclusions regarding 
the effectiveness of the CancerTYPE ID gene expression test to aid in identifying the site of origin for cancers in patients 
with indeterminate, uncertain, or differential diagnoses. Peer-reviewed literature supporting the entire assay process as 
well as publications demonstrating that CancerTYPE ID provides accurate, clinically actionable information resulting in 
improved outcomes is needed. A 2022 update to the original 2018 assessment found no newly published studies meeting 
inclusion criteria for the Hayes report. (Hayes, CancerTYPE ID [biotheranostics Inc.], 2018, updated 2022). A 2023 Hayes 
research brief identified no new relevant publications evaluating clinical validity or utility of the CancerTYPE ID test 
(Hayes, CancerTYPE ID (Biotheranostics, Inc., 2023). 
 
A systematic review conducted by Binder et al. (2018) to determine incidence and survival trends and to discuss the value 
of comprehensive genomic profiling (CGP) in individuals with CUP. Age-standardized incidence rates (ASR) per 100,000 
were calculated for 2935 individuals with CUP from 1981 to 2014 using cancer registry data of the canton of Zurich, 
Switzerland. Kaplan-Meier survival curves were estimated for sex, age, and histological groups. Cox proportional hazards 
regression models were used to estimate adjusted hazard ratios (HR). A literature review was conducted to assess the 
current use of CGP in individuals with CUP. ASR of CUP increased from 10.3 to 17.6 between 1981 and 1997 and 
decreased to 5.8/100,000 in 2014. Mean overall survival remained stable. Mortality was lower for participants with 
squamous cell carcinoma (HR 0.48 [95% CI, 0.41-0.57]), neuroendocrine carcinoma (0.75 [0.63-0.88]), and higher for 
unclassified neoplasms (1.25 [1.13-1.66]) compared to adenocarcinomas. The literature review identified 10 studies using 
CGP of CUP tissue. Clinically relevant mutations were identified in up to 85% of individuals with CUP, of which 13%-64% 
may benefit from currently available drugs. The authors concluded that CUP incidence decreased most likely due to 
improved diagnostics, however, mortality did not improve over the last 34 years. CGP testing may help to identify 
molecular signatures in individuals with CUP and enable targeted treatment. Given poor prognosis and limited treatment 
options for individuals with CUP, genomic profiling using NGS technologies may meet a clinical need. The findings of this 
study need to be validated by well-designed studies. Further investigation is needed before clinical usefulness of this 
procedure is proven. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
A Clinical Practice Guideline addressing CUP was published by Krämer et al. in 2023. The authors state that pan-cancer 
NGS can be used in CUP, however, randomized trials assessing the clinical utility of such tests are not yet completed. To 
date, two randomized trials have failed to demonstrate that GEP-based site-specific therapy is superior to standard 
empiric therapy. Thus, no recommendation addressing the use of GEP for site-directed therapy in CUP is provided. 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) clinical practice guidelines for occult primary state that while there may 
be a diagnostic benefit of GEP assays, it is similar to immunohistochemical staining in terms of accuracy of tumor 
classification, and a clinical benefit for GEP has not been demonstrated. The panel does not recommend gene 
sequencing for the identification of tissue of origin as standard management in the diagnostic workup of patients with 
occult primary tumors. Molecular profiling of tumor tissue using NGS or other techniques which identify gene fusions may 
be considered after initial determination of histology has been made. Testing on tumor tissue is preferred, but cell-free 
DNA can be considered if tumor tissue testing is not feasible. NCCN suggests that pathologists and oncologists 
collaborate on the judicious use of modalities including immunohistochemistry, GEP and NGS on a case-by-case basis, 
with the best individualized patient outcome in mind (NCCN Occult Primary/Cancer of Unknown Primary [CUP], v2.2025). 
 
Colorectal Cancer (CRC) 
Current evidence addressing the use of molecular testing for predicting risk of colorectal cancer (CRC) recurrence or for 
CRC screening purposes is insufficient. Additional high-quality studies supporting clinical utility are needed. 
 
In a prospective, observational, multicenter study known as ECLIPSE (Evaluation of the ctDNA LUNAR Test in an 
Average Patient Screening Episode), Chung et al. (2024) assessed the performance of a cell-free DNA (cfDNA) blood-
based test (Shield, Guardant Health) to identify asymptomatic and early-stage colorectal cancer in an average risk 
population. The study was sponsored by the test manufacturer, Guardant Health. The main outcomes evaluated were 
sensitivity for colorectal cancer detection and specificity for advanced neoplasia compared to colonoscopy. A secondary 
outcome assessed was sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions. Initially, 10,258 participants were enrolled; 7861 of 
those met all eligibility criteria and were included in the final analysis. The study results revealed test sensitivity of 83.1% 
for detection of colorectal cancer (95% confidence interval [CI], 72.2 to 90.3), with 16.9% of participants who had 
documented colorectal cancer (detected via colonoscopy) showing a negative result. For stage I-III colorectal cancer, 
sensitivity was calculated to be 87.5% (95% CI, 75.3 to 94.1) Sensitivity for advanced precancerous lesions was 13.2% 
(95% CI, 11.3 to 15.3). Almost 90% of participants who had no advanced colorectal neoplasia (either CRC or advanced

precancerous lesions) detected on colonoscopy had a negative cfDNA blood test (10.4% had a positive cfDNA blood test) 
for an overall specificity for any advanced neoplasia of 89.6% (95% CI, 88.8 to 90.3). Specificity in participants whose 
colonoscopy results showed no colorectal cancer, no advanced precancerous lesions, and no nonadvanced precancerous 
lesions was 89.9% (95% CI, 89.0 to 90.7). Invalid cfDNA test results were received by 3.7% of participants. The authors 
recommend ongoing study evaluating participant adherence to cfDNA blood-based testing across various care settings as 
well as research regarding health economic and colorectal cancer-related outcomes. Additionally, studies that address 
impact of longitudinal testing on sensitivity for advanced neoplasia are advised. 
 
The ColonSentry test uses quantitative real-time PCR to measure RNA transcript expression of 7 genes using a blood 
sample. The results are expressed as a ColonSentry score predicting an individual’s risk of CRC related to risk in an 
average population. Hayes performed a Molecular Test Assessment addressing this technology in 2024.and found 
insufficient evidence to support use of the ColonSentry test for predicting CRC risk, citing limited studies and data and 
significant limitations in the existing evidence (Hayes, ColonSentry [StageZero Life Sciences], 2024). 
 
In a 2024 Molecular Test Assessment, Hayes found insufficient evidence to support the use of the Oncotype Dx Colon 
Recurrence Score test. Overall, a very low-quality body of evidence exists for the use of this test in both stage II, 
mismatch repair proficient colon cancer and stage IIIA/B colon cancer (Hayes, Oncotype DX Colon Recurrence Score test 
[Exact Sciences.], 2024). 
 
In 2023, Rokavec and associates sought to identify and validate a prognostic mRNA expression signature for the 
stratification of individuals with stage II CRC according to their risk for relapse. From 792 primary stage II CRCs, publicly 
available mRNA expression profiling data were analyzed to find genes consistently associated with relapse-free survival 
(RFS). Next, the gene expression signature was validated using NanoString technology and computationally refined on 
primary colorectal samples from 205 individuals with stage II CRC. Finally, validation of the refined signature was carried 
out in two independent, publicly available training cohorts comprising 166 individuals with stage II CRC. A 61-gene 
signature was identified and determined to be highly significantly associated with RFS (HR = 37.08, p = 2.68*10
-106
, 
sensitivity = 89.29%, specificity = 89.61%, and area under the curve [AUC] = 0.937). Experimental validation and 
refinement then identified a 15-gene signature that strongly predicted relapse in three separate cohorts: an in-house 
cohort (HR = 20.4, p = 8.73*10
-23
, sensitivity = 90.32%, specificity = 80.99%, AUC = 0.812), publicly available cohort 
GSE161158 (HR = 5.81, p = 3.57*10
-4
, sensitivity = 64.29%, specificity = 81.67%, AUC = 0.796), and publicly available 
cohort GSE26906 (HR = 7.698, p = 7.26*10
-8
, sensitivity = 61.54%, specificity = 78.33%, AUC = 0.752). Pooled cohort 
values showed that the 15-gene signature test (HR = 4.72, p = 7.76*10
-25
, sensitivity = 75%, specificity = 67.44%, AUC = 
0.784) was superior to the Oncotype DX colon 7-gene signature test (HR = 2.698, p = 6.3*10
-8
, sensitivity = 62.16%, 
specificity = 55.5%, AUC = 0.633), which is currently the most widely used signature for prognostication of stage II colon 
cancer. The authors assert that they were able to identify and validate a new 15-gene expression signature for 
prognostication and stratification of individuals with stage II CRC which performed better in the evaluated validation 
cohorts than currently used clinico-pathologic biomarkers and signatures for stage II colon cancer prognostication. They 
speculate that this 15-gene expression signature has the potential to improve prognostication and therapy decisions for 
individuals diagnosed with stage II colon cancer. Further evaluation of the 15-gene signature in additional cohorts is 
recommended, including a combination of signature analysis and clinico-pathologic parameters, which may improve 
prognostic sensitivity and specificity. In addition, assessment of the signature and predictive value related to 
chemotherapy benefit in prospective, randomized controlled studies is required. 
 
Yothers et al. (2022) conducted a patient-specific meta-analysis of 12-gene colon cancer recurrence score validation 
studies for recurrence risk assessment after surgery with or without fluorouracil (5FU) and oxaliplatin. Three validation 
studies of the 12-gene colon recurrence score assay were used with pre-specified patient-specific meta-analysis (PSMA) 
methods to integrate the 12-gene Oncotype DX Colon Recurrence Score result (RS) with the clinical and pathology risk 
factors stage, T-stage, mis-match repair (MMR) status, and number of nodes examined to calculate individualized 
recurrence risk estimates. Baseline risk estimation used the most recent studies, so the risk estimates reflect current 
medical practice. The effect of 5FU was estimated with a meta-analysis of two studies. The effect of oxaliplatin was 
estimated using one of the RS assay validation studies, in which participants were randomized to 5FU with or without 
oxaliplatin. The RS result and each of the clinical-pathologic factors provided independent prognostic information for 
recurrence. Among stage II, T3, MMR-proficient participants with ≥ 12 nodes examined (the most common scenario), 
those with RS ≤ 30 (approximately 48%) had estimated five-year recurrence risk ≤ 10% with surgery alone. Among stage 
IIIA/B, T3, MMR-deficient participants with ≥ 12 nodes examined, those with RS ≤ 19 (approximately 14%) had an 
estimated five-year recurrence risk ≤ 10% with surgery alone. Among stage IIIA/B, T3, MMR-proficient participants with ≥ 
12 nodes examined, those with RS ≤ 14 (approximately 6%) had estimated five-year recurrence risk ≤ 10% with 5FU 
alone. The authors concluded that the PSMA integrates the 12-gene colon RS result with clinical and pathology factors to 
provide individualized recurrence risk estimates that reflect current medical practice. The risk estimates are in a range that 
may help inform treatment decisions for a substantial number of individuals with stage II and stage III cancer. Limitations

include that the estimated effect of 5FU is from a meta-analysis of a randomized study and a non-randomized treatment 
comparison with covariate adjustment to reduce bias. The SUNRISE study was a retrospective analysis that selected 
participants who had not received adjuvant chemotherapy after resection for stage II or III colon cancer and this may have 
led to selection of participants whom clinicians had considered to be at lower risk of recurrence. Also, the PSMA risk 
assessment used a baseline risk assessment from the last two enrolling studies (NSABP C-07, enrolling from 2000–2002 
and SUNRISE, enrolling from 2000–2005). If further improvements in clinical outcomes have occurred since this time, 
they are not reflected in the present recurrence risk estimates. Finally, the RS result is not predictive, that is, it is not 
associated with the relative treatment effect of chemotherapy with 5FU or oxaliplatin. Further research with randomized 
controlled trials is needed to validate these findings. 
 
Daemen et al. (2021) conducted a retrospective study and review of randomized, open-label, prospective, parallel three-
arm, phase three trial, sponsored by F. Hoffmann-La Roche, to improve high-risk classification by identifying biological 
pathways associated with outcome in adjuvant stage II/III CRC. A total of 1062 participants with stage III or high-risk stage 
II colon carcinoma from the three-arm randomized phase three AVANT trial were included in this retrospective study. The 
authors performed expression profiling to identify a prognostic signature. Data from validation cohort GSE39582, The 
Cancer Genome Atlas, and cell lines were used to further validate the prognostic biology. Retrospective analysis of the 
adjuvant AVANT trial uncovered a prognostic signature capturing three biological functions-stromal, proliferative, and 
immune-that outperformed the Consensus Molecular Subtypes (CMS) and recurrence prediction signatures like Oncotype 
Dx in an independent cohort. Importantly, within the immune component, high granzyme B (GZMB) expression had a 
significant prognostic impact while other individual T-effector genes were less or not prognostic. In addition, the authors 
found GZMB to be endogenously expressed in CMS2 tumor cells and to be prognostic in a T cell independent fashion. 
The authors concluded that this study furthers their understanding of the underlying biology that propagates stage II/III 
CRC disease progression and provides scientific rationale for future high-risk stratification and targeted treatment 
evaluation in biomarker defined subpopulations of resectable high-risk CRC. The results also shed light on an alternative 
GZMB source with context-specific implications on the disease's unique biology. A limitation to this study is that these 
results need to be clinically validated in a prospective study. 
 
A 2020 (updated 2023) Hayes Molecular Test Assessment evaluated the use of Epi proColon (now known as 
ColoHealth
™) 
for detecting methylated Septin 9 as cell-free circulating DNA. The test is intended as a screening tool for 
CRC in average-risk adults (50 or older) who have historically not completed their recommended CRC screening. Epi 
proColon uses real-time PCR to qualitatively identify DNA of methylated SEPT9 in plasma obtained from the whole blood 
specimens of individuals undergoing testing. Hayes identified several studies addressing the use of Epi proColon, but the 
overall body of evidence is of low-quality. The accuracy of the test appears to increase in more advanced cancer stages 
(II-IV). Because this test is intended for individuals who would otherwise be noncompliant for colon cancer screening, 
there may be an impact on the management of these otherwise non-compliant individuals; however it does not replace 
standard screening tools and there is concern around the overall accuracy of the test to distinguish individuals with CRC 
and also a remaining need for identification of the population that would appreciate the greatest benefit from this test. 
Further study is recommended (Hayes, Epi proColon [Epigenomics Inc.], 2020, updated 2023. 
 
In a meta-analysis, Hu et al. (2019) evaluated the diagnostic value of the methylated SEPT9 (mSEPT9) gene for CRC 
detection. Twenty-two studies comprising 2271 individuals with CRC were included. The overall analysis of mSEPT9 
showed a summary sensitivity of 0.69, specificity of 0.92, positive likelihood ratio (PLR) of 8.1, negative likelihood ratio 
(NLR) of 0.34, diagnostic odds ratio (DOR) of 24, and area under the curve (AUC) of 0.89. Subgroup and meta-regression 
analyses revealed that the diagnostic value was higher specific to the Epi proColon 2.0 assay, in individuals of Asian 
heritage, and when the mSEPT9 test was combined with fecal occult blood testing (FOBT) or fecal immunochemical 
testing (FIT) when compared to other methods of methylated SEPT9 testing, white ethnicity, and mSEPT9 testing alone. 
The mSEPT9 positivity rate was higher in advanced CRC cases than in early-stage cases, and higher in CRC cases than 
in adenoma cases. No significant difference in mSEPT9 positivity was noted between left- and right-sided CRC. Per the 
authors, these findings suggest that plasma mSEPT9 has high diagnostic value for CRC, especially when newer 
methodologies are incorporated. Study limitations include the following: there was no consistent cut-off value when 
analyzing the diagnostic value, there was variability in control groups included in some of the studies, and heterogeneity 
related to sensitivity and specificity was significant across studies which could impact the reliability. In addition, risk factors 
for CRC were not accounted for and the analysis included only English and Chinese articles. Additional studies are 
needed to confirm the reliability of mSEPT9 for use as a biomarker in diagnosing CRC. 
 
Zhang et al. (2017a) retrospectively reviewed the prognostic role of caudal-related homeobox transcription factor 2 
(CDX2) expression in individuals with stage 1 and stage III metastatic CRC after complete surgical resection. The cohort 
(n = 145) included 66 participants with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC and a comparison cohort of 79 participants with 
CDX2-positive metastatic CRC. The prevalence of absent CDX2 expression in this cohort was 5.6%. After adjusting for 
covariates in a multivariate model, the association of a lack of CDX2 expression and OS remained statistically significant

(HR, 4.52; 95% CI, 2.50-8.17; PÂ < .0001). In addition, the median PFS (3 vs 10 months; HR, 2.23; 95% CI, 1.52-3.27; 
PÂ < .0001) for first-line chemotherapy was significantly decreased in participants with CDX2-negative metastatic CRC. 
The authors concluded that the results showed that a lack of CDX2 expression in metastatic CRC is an adverse 
prognostic feature and a potential negative predictor of the response to chemotherapy. Further research with randomized 
controlled trials is needed to validate these findings. 
 
To evaluate whether individuals with CDX2-negative tumors might benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy, Dalerba et al. 
(2016) investigated the association between CDX2 status, and assessed at either the mRNA or protein level, the disease-
free survival among participants who either did or did not receive adjuvant chemotherapy. Reviewing a database of 669 
individuals with stage II colon cancer and 1228 participants with stage III colon cancer, the authors reported that their 
results confirmed that treatment with CDX2 as a biomarker in colon cancer adjuvant chemotherapy was associated with a 
higher rate of disease-free survival in both the stage II subgroup (91% with chemotherapy vs 56% with no chemotherapy, 
p = 0.006) and the stage III subgroup (74% with chemotherapy vs 37% with no chemotherapy, p < 0.001) of the CDX2-
negative participant population (Fig. 5). A test for the interaction between the biomarker and the treatment revealed that 
the benefit observed in CDX2-negative cohorts was superior to that observed in CDX2-positive cohorts in both the stage II 
subgroup (p = 0.02 for the interaction) and the stage III subgroup (p = 0.005 for the interaction). In the authors’ opinion, 
their results indicate that individuals with stage II or stage III CDX2-negative colon cancer might benefit from adjuvant 
chemotherapy and that adjuvant chemotherapy might be a treatment option for those with stage II CDX2-negative 
disease, who are commonly treated with surgery alone. Given the exploratory and retrospective design of this study, 
these results will need to be further validated through randomized, clinical trials, in conjunction with genomic DNA 
sequencing studies. 
 
Yamanaka et al. evaluated the 12-gene Recurrence Score assay (Oncotype Dx Colon Recurrence Score) for stage II and 
III colon cancer without chemotherapy to reveal the natural course of recurrence risk in stage III disease (the Sunrise 
Study). A cohort-sampling design was used. From 1487 consecutive individuals with stage II to III disease who had 
surgery alone, 630 participants were sampled for inclusion with a 1:2 ratio of recurrence and nonrecurrence. Sampling 
was stratified by stage (II v III). The assay was performed on formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded primary cancer tissue. 
Association of the Recurrence Score result with recurrence-free interval (RFI) was assessed by using weighted Cox 
proportional hazards regression. With respect to prespecified subgroups, as defined by low (< 30), intermediate (30 to 
40), and high (≥ 41) Recurrence Score risk groups, participants with stage II disease in the high-risk group had a five-year 
risk of recurrence similar to individuals with stage IIIA to IIIB disease in the low-risk group (19% v 20%), whereas 
participants with stage IIIA to IIIB disease in the high-risk group had a recurrence risk similar to that of those with stage 
IIIC disease in the low-risk group (approximately 38%). The authors conclude that this validation study of the 12-gene 
Recurrence Score assay in stage III colon cancer without chemotherapy showed the heterogeneity of recurrence risks in 
stage III as well as in stage II colon cancer. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 
In their 2021 clinical guidelines for colorectal cancer screening (Shaukat et al.), the ACG recommends against Septin 9 
testing for CRC screening (Conditional recommendation, very low-quality of evidence.) Given the evidence showing low 
sensitivity and the lack of long-term and comparative data on the Septin 9 test, the ACG states “it is not considered an 
optimal screening modality at this time.” 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
In an update to their guideline addressing adjuvant therapy for stage II colon cancer, ASCO (Baxter et al., 2022) notes 
that their expert panel recognizes the development of tumor-based profiling tools that are designed to provide 
predictive/prognostic information which can potentially be used in treatment decision-making, but states that these types 
of tests are not yet ready for routine use. Further evidence of their effectiveness is needed before ASCO will endorse the 
use of these tools. 
 
American Society for Clinical Pathology (ASCP)/College of American Pathologists (CAP)/ 
Association for Molecular Pathology (AMP)/American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
Together, the ASP, CAP, AMP, and ASCO convened an expert panel to create evidence-based guidelines for standard 
molecular biomarker testing in individuals diagnosed with CRC, which included a comprehensive search of the published 
literature including over 4,000 articles. Twenty-one recommendations were made, which include specifics regarding 
individual gene testing and requirements for laboratories. The guideline asserts that evidence supports testing for 
variations in specific genes in the EGFR signaling pathway because they may provide information that is clinically relevant 
for targeted therapy of CRC with anti-EGFR monoclonal antibodies. Some biomarkers, such as BRAF and DNA mismatch

repair (MMR) have been shown to have clear value for prognostication and others (KRAS and NRAS) are evidence-
backed for negative predictive value for benefit to anti-EGFR therapies. (Sepulveda et al., 2017) 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Clinical Practice Guidelines for colon cancer recommend universal MMR or MSI testing for any individual with a 
personal history of colon or rectal cancer to 1) identify individuals with Lynch syndrome, 2) to assist with decision-making 
regarding use of immunotherapy for individuals with metastatic disease and 3) to inform clinical decisions for individuals 
with stage II disease. The guidelines summarize current data on multigene assays, Immunoscore testing and ctDNA, but 
the NCCN panel is uncertain regarding the value these tests add, noting insufficient data to recommend use of multigene 
test panels, Immunoscore or post-surgical ctDNA tests to either estimate risk of recurrence or make determinations 
regarding adjuvant therapy cancer. The panel encourages clinical trial enrollment to generate further data on these tests. 
Regarding the use of biomarker testing determining appropriate targeted therapies for treatment of advanced or 
metastatic CRC, the panel recommends determination of tumor gene status for KRAS/NRAS and BRAF mutations, as 
well as HER2 amplifications and MSI/MMR status (if not previously done). Such testing may be performed for individual 
genes or as part of an NGS panel, with NGS being the preferred methodology (NCCN Colon cancer, v5.2024). 
 
NCCN guidelines for colorectal cancer screening briefly address blood-based screening tests, noting that the septin9 
gene (SEPT9) has demonstrated ability to distinguish CRC tissue from surrounding normal tissue; circulating methylated 
SEPT9 is a biomarker for CRC. However, several factors that may negatively impact the performance of the SEPT9 tests 
have been suggested. These include early-stage disease, diabetes, age over 65 years, arteriosclerosis, and arthritis. In 
addition, the interval for repeating the testing is undetermined; the panel will continue to review the evidence for this 
strategy as it is published. 
 
United States Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) 
The 2021 USPSTF recommendation statement for colorectal cancer screening indicates that because of limited evidence, 
the USPSTF recommendations do not include “serum tests, urine tests, or capsule endoscopy for colorectal cancer 
screening”. 
 
Pancreatic Cancer and Ampullary Adenocarcinoma 
There is currently insufficient evidence to support the use of molecular testing for risk assessment or diagnosis of 
pancreatic cancer. Additional large, high-quality studies are required to evaluate the clinical validity and utility of this 
technology. 
 
In a prospective, multicenter study, Nicolle et al. (2024) investigated the use of molecular analysis of DNA and mRNA 
extracted from the products of ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration biopsy of primary tumors in individuals with proven 
pancreatic adenocarcinoma to help distinguish between metastatic tumors and other tumor types. A total of 397 
participants were included. Variant allele frequency of the KRAS mutation was leveraged to assess tumor cellularity, 
which ranged from 15 to 20% in all cells, regardless of the stage of the tumor. The researchers found that the molecular 
characteristics of metastatic primary tumors was significantly different from other types of tumors. In the metastatic 
tumors, TP53 mutations were more common (p = 0.0002) and RNF43 mutations were less common. Metastatic tumors 
were also found to have more basal-like tumor mRNA component (p = 0.001). Primary tumors in metastatic forms 
displayed transcriptomic characteristics that were related to worse outcomes when compared to other primary tumors, 
suggesting that their molecular profile may be important in the spreading of cancer cells beyond the pancreas. Some 
molecular markers were associated with better overall survival rates; these included mutations in homologous 
recombination deficiency genes in participants who received first-line platinum-based chemotherapy (p = 0.025) and wild-
type TP53 genes in participants with locally advanced tumors who received radio-chemotherapy (p = 0.01). A specific 
transcriptomic profile (known as GemPred) was associated with a significantly better overall survival level in participants 
with locally advanced or metastatic pancreatic cancer who received a gemcitabine-based first line of treatment (p = 
0.019). The authors assert that the molecular analysis of both DNA and RNA can help to predict therapeutic response in 
individuals with pancreatic adenocarcinoma, which can impact overall survival outcomes in individuals undergoing 
platinum or gemcitabine-based therapies as well as radio-chemotherapy. This technology could also have potential 
benefit for the use in identifying targeted treatments. Though results appear promising, the study did have limitations, 
including findings of 6.4% of total samples that were negative for nucleic acids even though the core biopsy was of 
acceptable quality. Additionally, 45% of the samples tested did not reach RNA or DNA thresholds recommended by the 
sequencing facility (i.e., > 150 ng/sample). Additional high-quality studies are required to confirm these results and further 
investigate clinical utility. 
 
A Hayes Precision Medicine Research Brief addressed PancreaSeq, a next generation sequencing-based test that 
analyzes 74 genes isolated from pancreatic cyst fluid to evaluate the risk of malignancy. Hayes concluded that there is

currently not enough published peer-reviewed literature to evaluate the evidence related to PancreaSeq Genomic 
Classifier for characterization of pancreatic cysts in a full assessment (Hayes, PancreaSeq Genomic Classifier [University 
of Pittsburgh Medical Center], 2024). 
 
In 2023, Paniccia and colleagues prospectively investigated the use of NGS of pancreatic cyst fluid in a real-time, multi-
institutional group of individuals with pancreatic cysts. A total of 1887 specimens from 1832 individuals were tested with 
the earlier, 22-gene version of the PancreaSeq NGS panel. Follow up data was available for 66% (n = 1216) of 
participants. Of 251 individuals (21%) with surgical pathology available, mitogen-activated protein kinase/GNAS mutations 
had 90% sensitivity and 100% specificity for a mucinous cyst (PPV, 100%; NPV, 77%). When low-level variants were 
excluded, the combination of mitogen-activated protein kinase/GNAS and TP53/SMAD4/CTNNB1/mammalian target of 
rapamycin alterations had 88% sensitivity and 98% specificity for advanced neoplasia (PPV, 97%; NPV, 93%). With 
inclusion of cytopathologic evaluation along with PancreaSeq testing, sensitivity improved to 93% and high specificity of 
95% (PPV, 92%; NPV, 95%) was preserved. Per the authors, lesser diagnostic performance is found when other 
methodologies or current pancreatic cyst guidelines (e.g., American Gastroenterology Association and International 
Association of Pancreatology/Fukuoka guidelines) are used. Out of 965 individuals who did not undergo surgery, none 
developed malignancy. Postoperative testing with Oncomine found mucinous cysts with BRAF fusions and ERBB2 
amplification and advanced neoplasia with CDKN2A alterations. The authors concluded that these results highlight the 
clinical utility of targeted NGS due to its high sensitivity and high specificity in the diagnosis of mucinous cysts and the 
detection of advanced neoplasia within a mucinous cyst. This study also expands the number of genomic alterations that 
are found not only in mucinous cysts but serous cystadenomas and cystic pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors. Although 
more high-quality studies are required, the data reported from this investigation adds to the existing support for integrating 
targeted NGS testing into evidence-based pancreatic cyst guidelines. Identified limitations include limited availability of 
surgical pathology for participants (14%) which represents surgical selection bias, testing selection bias (only pancreatic 
cyst fluid specimens that were satisfactory for targeted NGS testing were used), and limited follow-up period. 
 
In a prospective, single-arm pilot study, Iwaya et al. (2023) analyzed viability and potential clinical utility of NGS using 
liquid-based cytology (LBC) samples obtained from endoscopic, ultrasound-guided fine-needle biopsy (EUS-FNB) 
performed on individuals with pancreatic cancer. Enrolled were 33 individuals with pancreatic cancer who underwent 
EUS-FNB; of these, samples from 31 individuals were included for DNA extraction/NGS and 30 of these (96.8%) had a 
sufficient quantity of DNA for analysis. The results of the study showed an overall success rate of 86.7% (n = 26) for use 
of formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded (FFPE), LBC, or frozen samples. When results were stratified using a variant allele 
frequency (VAF) > 10% tumor burden, the NGS success rate was 76.7% (n = 23) in FFPE, 83.3% (n = 25) in LBC, and 
76.7% (n = 23) in frozen samples. Rates of detection for the primary gene variations were as follows: 86.7% for KRAS, 
73.3% for TP53, 66.7% for CDKN2A, 36.7% for SMAD4, and 16.7% for ARID1A. The highest median value of VAF 
(23.5%) for KRAS and TP53 was found with LBC. In this study, pancreatic cancer gene variant analysis via NGS was 
performed effectively using LBC in comparison with FFPE and frozen samples. The authors concluded that EUS-FNB 
samples are able to provide sufficient amounts of high-quality DNA for NGS analysis (when relatively small gene panels 
are used). Use of LBC specimens for NGS testing may be an option for genetic testing as a diagnostic or therapeutic 
approach for individuals with pancreatic cancer. Limitations of this study include the small sample size and inclusion of a 
single center only, using a small number of experienced endoscopists. In addition, the individuals in this study were 
diagnosed by imaging only and no final pathology was performed on resected specimens. The gene panel used did not 
include GNAS, VHL or RNF43; as such, the possibility of intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm (IPMN)-derived 
pancreatic cancer associated with these genes could not be ruled out. 
 
Rift et al. (2023) evaluated the feasibility and diagnostic accuracy of molecular analysis and subtyping of pancreatic cystic 
lesions (PCLs) using EUS-guided “through the needle biopsy” (TTNB) sampling in a prospective study. In total, 101 
individuals with PCLs > 15mm in the largest cross-section were included. NGS was used to analyze the EUS-guided 
TTNB samples for point mutations in tumor suppressors and oncogenes with a 51-gene customized hotspot panel. 
Histologic diagnosis was used to calculate sensitivity and specificity. A total of 91 participants had residual TTNB samples 
available for NGS after initial microscopic analysis of the specimens had been performed. Forty-nine of these revealed 
mutations, most often in KRAS and GNAS. This indicated an excess frequency of IPMNs in the study population. 
Sensitivity of 83.7% (95% CI, 70.3-92.7) and specificity of 81.8% (95% CI, 48.2-97.7) were established for the diagnosis 
of a mucinous cyst and sensitivity of 87.2% (95% CI, 74.2-95.2) and specificity of 84.6% (95% CI, 54.5-98.1) were 
demonstrated for the diagnosis of an IPMN. The authors concluded that molecular testing performed on TTNB samples 
yielded high sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of mucinous cysts and IPMN. Although TTNB has a risk of adverse 
effects of approximately 9.9% (which must be carefully considered for each individual’s clinical situation), the use of TTNB 
specimens is a solid alternative to use of cyst fluid for combined molecular and histologic diagnosis of PCLs. The study 
was limited by its single-center design and small sample size. In addition, the cohort included mostly low-grade lesions 
with a majority of IPMNs and a limited surgical cohort. Lastly, no cyst fluid was obtained for NGS analysis and

comparison. Further studies focused on characterizing the subgroup of individuals with pancreatic cancer that would 
derive the greatest benefit from EUS-guided TTNB samples are recommended. 
 
A Hayes Molecular Test Assessment concluded that there is insufficient evidence to support the use of the PancraGEN 
test to assess the risk of cancer in pancreatic cysts to help physicians choose appropriate surveillance strategies or 
surgical options for individuals with pancreatic cysts. No peer-reviewed articles were identified that assesses the analytical 
validity, clinical validity, or clinical utility of the current version of the PancraGEN test. In the 2023 annual review, 29 new 
abstracts were published; however, none met the inclusion criteria set out in the 2022 report. There has been no change 
in the current rating of D2 and no new application of the technology for the test. (Hayes, PancraGEN [Interpace 
Diagnostics], 2022, updated 2024). 
 
A retrospective study was performed by Kandimalla et al. (2021) using a genome-wide DNA methylation analysis of 
multiple GI cancers to develop a pan-GI diagnostic assay and validate the tissue-specific differentially methylated regions 
(DMRs) in 300 cell-free DNA specimens for early detection and/or population screening of all GI cancers. The study 
design involved tissue discovery followed by plasma cell-free DNA (cfDNA) validation. Methylation data from 1,781 tumor 
and adjacent normal tissues and DMRs between individual GI cancers and adjacent normal were studied including CRC, 
hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC), gastric cancer (GC), esophageal 
adenocarcinoma (EAC), and pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC). By comparing data from tumor versus normal 
tissues within each GI cancer, as well as across all GI cancers, a total of 67,832 regions of interest (ROI) were identified 
based on differentially methylated probes with a p < 0.001 and an absolute delta beta of 0.20 across all the comparisons. 
Three distinct categories of DMR panels were developed to include (i) cancer-specific biomarker panels with AUC values 
of 0.98 (CRC), 0.98 (HCC), 0.94 (ESCC), 0.90 (GC), 0.90 (EAC), and 0.85 (PDAC); (ii) a pan-GI panel that detected all GI 
cancers with an AUC of 0.88; and (iii) a multi-cancer (tissue of origin) prediction panel, EpiPanGI Dx, with a prediction 
accuracy of 0.85-0.95 for most GI cancers. The authors concluded that by using a novel biomarker discovery approach, 
they were able to provide the first evidence for a cfDNA methylation assay that offers strong diagnostic accuracy for multi-
detection GI cancers in a non-invasive and cost-effective manner. This study is limited by its retrospective observations, 
limited sample size used to represent each stage, and lack of mutation profiles of cfDNA samples to be able to directly 
compare or combine the diagnostic performance of the methylation assay relative to genomic mutations. Further 
investigation with prospective evaluation is needed to determine the clinical relevance of these findings. 
 
Singhi et al. (2018) studied the clinical validity of using pre-operative pancreatic cyst fluid (PCF) for NGS of KRAS, GNAS, 
TP53, PIK3CA and PTEN genes to predict benign vs malignant lesions. PCF samples from 595 participants (626 
samples) were obtained through fine needle aspiration and subjected to NGS for the 5 genes. A different cohort of 159 
PCF specimens was also evaluated for KRAS/GNAS mutations by Sanger sequencing. Of the 595 participants, 308 
(49%) had KRAS or GNAS mutations and 35 had a mutation in TP53, PIK3CA, or PTEN. Follow up diagnostic pathology 
was available in 102 participants. For these 102, NGS testing of PCF for KRAS/GNAS had a 100% sensitivity (n = 56) and 
96% specificity for an intraductal papillary mucinous neoplasm. In the separate cohort of participants for whom Sanger 
sequencing was used, KRAS/GNAS mutations detection had a 65% sensitivity and 100% specificity. By NGS, the 
combination of KRAS/GNAS mutations and alterations in TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN had an 89% sensitivity and 100% 
specificity for advanced cancer. The study concluded that in comparison to Sanger sequencing, preoperative NGS of PCF 
for KRAS/GNAS mutations is highly sensitive for IPMNs and specific for mucinous pancreatic cysts. In addition, the 
combination of TP53/PIK3CA/PTEN alterations is a useful preoperative marker for advanced cancer. 
 
Wong et al. (2019) reported on ampullary cancer (AC) and germline alterations in BRCA2, ERBB2, and ELF3. Forty-five 
individuals with pathologically confirmed AC were tested with the Memorial Sloan Kettering Integrated Mutation Profiling of 
Actionable Cancer Targets (MSK-IMPACT) test (410-468 genes). Twenty-three individuals were also tested with GT with 
MSK-IMPACT (76-88 genes). Eight of 44 subjects (18%) were identified as harboring pathogenic mutations in BRCA2, 
ATM, RAD50, and MUTYH. Additionally, they found a wide spectrum of SAs in genes such as KRAS, MDM2, ERBB2, 
ELF3, and PIK3CA. Two individuals in the cohort underwent SA-targeted therapy, and one had a partial radiographic 
response. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American College of Gastroenterology (ACG) 
Elta et al. (2018) created clinical guidelines for the diagnosis and management of pancreatic cysts. The recommendation 
regarding molecular markers states: “Molecular markers can help identify IPMNs or MCNs. Their use may be considered 
in cases in which the diagnosis is unclear, and the results are likely to change management.” (Conditional 
recommendation, very low quality of evidence).

American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
Sohal et al. published an update to the ASCO Metastatic Pancreatic Cancer Guideline in 2020, noting that a complete 
discussion of molecular biomarker testing is outside the scope of the guideline, but a modification to the recommendations 
around molecular testing was made. This includes recommendation that all patients with pancreatic cancer should be 
offered information about biomarker testing and biomarker testing (specifically NTRK fusion testing) should be used in 
patient selection for targeted therapies. 
 
In a provisional opinion, ASCO notes that despite considerable effort, no biomarkers obtained through non-invasive 
means (e.g., blood, stool, urine) have been proven effective for early identification of pancreatic cancer in individuals with 
no symptoms. In addition, there is no evidence supporting clinical utility or validity for the use of ctDNA for pancreatic 
cancer screening outside the context of clinical trials. ASCO advises that thorough testing and validation of possible 
biomarkers that could be used in high-risk individuals is needed. (Stoffel et al., 2019) 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma guidelines include a recommendation for genetic testing for inherited mutations for 
individuals with confirmed pancreatic cancer and the use of tumor/somatic molecular profiling in cases of metastatic or 
locally advanced disease when an individual is a candidate for anti-cancer therapy. The use of molecular testing for 
diagnostics and risk assessment of pancreatic cyst fluid is not addressed. (NCCN Pancreatic Adenocarcinoma, 
version1.2025) 
 
Other Molecular Oncology Testing for Solid Tumor Cancers 
Multi-Cancer Detection Tests [e.g., Galleri (Grail, Inc.)] 
Multi-cancer detection (MCD) tests measure biological markers that cancer cells shed in body fluids. Current MCD assays 
are designed to find and measure the amount of a given substance in a sample (e.g., blood). These tests can check for 
many different types of cancer stemming from various organs. Currently, MCD tests are being studied in randomized 
controlled trials to determine the impact of this screening on occurrence of late-stage cancers and mortality. At present, 
there are no professional medical societies that have issued recommendations on the use of MCD tests for cancer 
screening (NCI, 2023) and published evidence does not support the use of MCD tests for screening for any type of 
cancer. 
 
In a recent systematic review (2023), LeeVan & Pinsky evaluated the ability of cell-free-nucleic acid-based MCD tests to 
predict cancer status. Twenty relevant publications met all inclusion criteria and were evaluated in this review. Most of the 
included studies reported specificity along with overall sensitivity and many of the studies also reported sensitivity by 
stage/cancer type. Taken as a whole, the studies in this review reported specificities of 95% or higher and a median 
sensitivity of 73%. The authors note that the majority of cases of cancer in the studies reviewed were evaluated with MCD 
tests at diagnosis, which may lead to overestimates of test sensitivity when compared to samples for individuals who are 
asymptomatic. It was also noted that sensitivity varied by cancer type and typically increased with cancer stage. 
Ultimately, the researchers recognize the lack of published evidence supporting clinical validity (and clinical utility) of cell-
free nucleic acid-based MCD testing and recommend further high-quality studies investigating MCD assay use in 
populations of asymptomatic individuals, which is the intended-use population for MCD testing.  
 
Schrag et al. (2023) published the results of PATHFINDER, a study funded by GRAIL which examined the feasibility of 
using MCD for cancer screening. PATHFINDER was a prospective cohort study that was performed in primary care and 
oncology outpatient centers that were part of seven different United States health networks. The blood of adults aged 50 
years or greater was collected and cfDNA was evaluated. If a methylation signature suggesting a cancer diagnosis was 
found, the predicted cancer origin was used to guide diagnostic assessment. The results were returned to the physicians 
overseeing each participants care. The chief outcome of this study was the time to further diagnostic testing and the 
extent of the testing performed that would confirm the presence or absence of cancer. A total of 6621 individuals had 
analyzable results and participated in the study. Of these, 1.4% (n = 92) had results which showed detection of a cancer 
signal. Of the 92 individuals with results showing detection of a cancer signal, 35 (38%) were subsequently diagnosed 
with cancer (true positives) and 57 (62%) were not diagnosed with cancer (false positives). Diagnostic resolution was 
achieved in a median of 79 days (interquartile range [IQR] 37–219): 57 days (33–143) in true-positive and 162 days (44–
248) in false-positive participants. Two participants who began diagnostic evaluations prior to receiving MCD results were 
excluded. The majority of participants had both imaging (30 [91%] of 33 with true-positive results and 53 [93%] of 57 with 
false-positive results) and laboratory testing (26 [79%] of 33 with true-positive results and 50 [88%] of 57 with false-
positive results) and participants with false-positive results had fewer procedures (17 [30%] of 57) than true positive 
results (27 [82%] of 33). Surgery was performed in only four participants (one false-positive and three true-positives). The 
authors assert that this study affords early substantiation to the feasibility of using a single blood test to screen for multiple 
cancer types. They recognize the need for further large studies demonstrating clinical utility and assessing the impact of

MCD testing on cancer mortality. Several studies evaluating updated and refined versions of the MCD test originally used 
in PATHFINDER are in progress at this time.  
 
Another recent study funded by GRAIL assessed the performance of MCD testing in symptomatic individuals who were 
referred to for specialty evaluation from primary care. Nicholson et al. (2023) conducted a multi-center prospective 
observational study (SYMPLIFY) in England and Wales. Participants were 18 years of age or older and had been referred 
from primary care with symptoms that were either non-specific or potentially related to gynecological, lung, or 
gastrointestinal cancers. A sample of blood was obtained from each participant when they presented for further 
investigation of their symptoms. A total of 5461 individuals were included in the final cohort after all exclusionary criteria 
had been applied (e.g., previous malignancy, cytotoxic or demethylating agents, participation in another trial of a GRAIL 
MCD test, test errors, lack of final diagnosis, participant withdrawal). Participants were tracked until a diagnosis was 
reached or for a maximum of nine months. MCD was performed on cfDNA and blinded to clinical outcome. Finally, 
predictions from the MCD test were compared to the diagnosis obtained via standard processes to determine primary 
outcomes including overall PPV and NPV, sensitivity and specificity. Final outcomes were measured only in participants 
who had both a valid MCD test and diagnostic resolution. A total of 368 individuals (6.7%) were found to have a cancer 
diagnosis and 5093 (93.3%) did not have a cancer diagnosis. MCD testing identified cancer signals in 323 cases; 244 of 
those cases were ultimately diagnosed with cancer, indicating a PPV of 75.5% (95% CI 70·5–80.1), NPV of 97.6% (97.1–
98.0), sensitivity of 66.3% (61.2–71.1), and specificity of 98.4% (98.1–98.8). The researchers found that sensitivity 
increased with age and cancer stage (24.2% [95% CI 16.0–34.1] in stage I to 95.3% [88.5–98.7] in stage IV). When an 
individual had cancer and a cancer signal was detected by MCD testing, the MCD test’s prediction of site of origin was 
accurate in 85.2% (95% CI 79.8–89.3) of cases. Individuals with symptoms indicating a potential upper gastrointestinal 
cancer were found to have the highest sensitivity and NPV for the MCD test at 80.4% (95% CI 66.1–90.6) and 99.1% 
(98.2–99.6), respectively. The authors assert that this study was the first large-scale prospective evaluation of an MCD in 
a symptomatic population, and its results indicate that the use of MCD testing to assist clinical providers with decision-
making regarding the urgency of follow-up and route of referral from primary care is viable. In addition, they feel that data 
from this study may be used as a foundation for further prospective study on individuals who present to primary care 
clinics with non-specific symptoms. Further study is recommended to evaluate the impact of MCD testing on use of 
resources, clinical decision-making, and clinical outcomes. 
 
Klein et al. (2021) documented the results of an observational study to validate a multi-cancer early detection test 
designed to complement existing screening methods and potentially increase the number of cancers found through 
population screening, potentially impacting, and improving clinical outcomes. Including 4077 participants in an 
independent validation set (cancer n = 2823, non-cancer n = 1254), sensitivity, specificity, and cancer signal origin (CSO) 
were measured. This population was a pre-specified sub-study of the Circulating Cell-free Genome Atlas Study, a 
prospective, multi-center, observational study designed to collect biological samples (blood and tumor tissue) both from 
participants with newly diagnosed cancer and from participants without a diagnosis of cancer to characterize population 
heterogenicity in cancer and cancer-free participants so that models for distinguishing between cancer and non-cancer 
could be developed. According to the authors, the Atlas study demonstrated that MCED testing using cfDNA in 
combination with machine learning could detect cancer signals across various cancer types and predict cancer signal 
origin with high accuracy. The objective of the current study is to further validate an MCED test that has been refined for 
use as a screening tool. Overall sensitivity for cancer signal detection was 51.5% and showed increasing sensitivity with 
stage of cancer. Cancer signal detection specificity was 99.5% (95% confidence interval). Cancer signals were detected 
across more than 50 cancer types. CSO prediction in true positives was 88.7% overall. The researchers concluded that 
the MCED test showed high specificity and accuracy in prediction of CSO and detected signals across multiple cancer 
types. A noted limitation is that blood sample collection from participants with cancer done after biopsies had been 
performed could increase the possibility that tumor cfDNA fraction could also increase relative to pre-biopsy. In addition, 
CCGA is a case-control study, so would not reflect performance in a screening population. Further studies evaluating test 
performance and clinical utility in target-use population are needed. This study was included in the LeeVan & Pinsky 
systematic review discussed above.  
 
In a prospective case-control sub-study of the Atlas and STRIVE studies (NCT02889978 and NCT03085888), the 
performance of targeted methylation analysis of cfDNA in detecting and localizing multiple cancer types across all stages, 
with high specificity, was assessed. A total of 6689 participants (2482 with cancer [over 50 types], 4207 without cancer) 
were grouped into training or validation sets. Cell-free DNA was sequenced, targeting a panel of over 100,000 informative 
methylation areas. From this, a classifier was developed and validated for detection of cancer and localization of tissue of 
origin. The publication (Liu et al., 2020) documented consistent performance in both the training and validation sets. In the 
validation set, specificity was 99.3%. Stage I-III sensitivity was 67.3% in a pre-selected set of 12 cancer types (head and 
neck, esophagus, liver/bile-duct, anus, colon/rectum, bladder, plasma cell neoplasm, stomach, pancreas, ovary, lung, and 
lymphoma), which make up approximately 63% of annual cancer deaths in the US. Stage I-III sensitivity was 43.9% in all 
cancer types, with increase in detection as cancer stage increased. Tissue of original was predicted in 96% of samples

with cancer-like signals and of that group, the tissue of origin localization was accurate in 93%. In conclusion, the 
researchers indicate that cfDNA sequencing using informative methylation patterns warrants further evaluation in 
prospective, population-level studies. This study was included in the LeeVan & Pinsky systematic review discussed 
above. 
 
NavDx
®
 
NavDx is a blood test that is meant to detect and measure tumor tissue-modified viral (TTMV) human papillomavirus 
(HPV) DNA in individuals diagnosed with an HPV-related cancer to confirm tumor HPV genotype, evaluate current 
treatment response, identify MRD after treatment and potentially detect cancer recurrence earlier than standard follow up 
surveillance (Naveris, 2023). At present, there is insufficient evidence to support the use of NavDx for use in individuals 
with HPV-related cancers. 
 
In a 2024 systematic review and meta-analysis, Campo et al. evaluated the sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of 
circulating tumor HPVDNA (ctHPVDNA) and TTMV-HPVDNA by digital drop PCR (ddPCR) to determine the efficacy and 
limitations for its use in post-treatment surveillance of HPV+ oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). Twelve 
studies comprising 1311 participants were included in the meta-analysis. In 398 individuals, HPVDNA was evaluated by 
ctHPVDNA, and TTMV-HPVDNA was used to evaluate 913. The results showed pooled sensitivity and specificity of 86% 
(95% CI: 78%-91%) for ctHPVDNA and 96% (95% CI: 91%-99%) for TTMV-HPVDNA. Pooled diagnostic odds ratio 
(DOR) was 371.66 and the area under the curve (AUC) was 0.81 (95% CI, 0.67–0.91). The authors concluded that the 
use of cell-free DNA may be helpful for detecting earlier recurrence in individuals with HPV+OPSCC; however, these 
testing methodologies and protocols require standardization before they can be routinely used in clinical setting. Further 
research including prospective studies with larger numbers of participants and improvement in the test sensitivity are 
needed. Publication by Berger et al. (2022), previously discussed in this policy, was included in the Campo et al. 
systematic review and meta-analysis. 
 
Hayes published a Molecular Test Assessment in 2023 addressing the use of NavDx for the detection and measurement 
of circulating TTMV HPV DNA in HPV-related cancer. The assessment found that the overall body of evidence for the 
NavDx test is limited. Only one poor-quality study (Berger et al., 2022) meeting inclusion criteria assessed the currently 
marketed NavDx test. This study evaluated a single use of the test (monitoring for recurrence); it reported limited data for 
clinical performance, did not compare the NavDx test with the current standard care surveillance schedule or another 
assessment method, and lacked follow-up for patients with negative tests. No studies evaluated the clinical utility of the 
NavDx test to impact treatment decision-making or patient clinical outcomes for any use. No studies evaluated the clinical 
validity of the NavDx test to confirm tumor HPV genotype, assess current treatment response, or identify MRD 
posttreatment. The 2024 annual review of the NavDx Molecular Test assessment indicates that evidence newly published 
since the prior assessment is unlikely to change the current Hayes rating. (Hayes, NavDx [Naveris], 2023, updated 2024). 
 
An ECRI clinical evidence assessment evaluating NavDx for detecting recurrence of HPV-associated cancers concluded 
that based on evidence from two diagnostic cohort studies, NavDx may add incremental value for identifying HPV-
associated oropharyngeal squamous cell cancer (SCC) recurrence when used in addition to standard surveillance. 
However, available studies primarily focused on HPV-16 which makes in unclear how well it works for other HPV 
subtypes. Furthermore, there are no published data on the clinical utility of the NavDx on patient management or 
outcomes (ECRI, 2023). 
 
In a 2023 publication, Ferrandino et al. reported on the accuracy of TTMV HPV DNA testing via liquid biopsy for the 
diagnosis and monitoring of individuals with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (OPSCC). In this 
retrospective, observational cohort study including 399 participants, 163 were in the diagnostic cohort and 290 were in the 
surveillance cohort. In the diagnostic cohort, 152/163 participants had HPV-associated OPOSCC and 11/163 had HPV-
negative OPSCC. For this group, sensitivity of TTMV HPV DNA in pretreatment diagnosis was 91.5% (95% CI, 85.8%-
95.4% [139 of 152 tests]), and specificity was 100% (95% CI, 71.5%-100% [11 of 11 tests]). In the surveillance cohort, 
593 tests were conducted in the 290 participants. Molecularly confirmed pathological recurrences occurred in 23 
individuals. The TTMV HPV DNA test exhibited a sensitivity of 88.4% (95% CI, 74.9%-96.1% [38 of 43 tests]) and 
specificity of 100% (95% CI, 99.3%-100% [548 of 548 tests]) in identifying recurrences. The PPV was 100% (95% CI, 
90.7%-100% [38 of 38 tests]), and the NPV was 99.1% (95% CI, 97.9%-99.7% [548 of 553 tests]). Median time from 
positive TTMV HPV DNA test to pathologic confirmation was 47 (0-507) days. The authors concluded that this cohort 
study revealed a 100% specificity of the TTMV HPV DNA assay when used in a clinical setting for both diagnosis and 
surveillance. Sensitivity, however, was 91.5% for the diagnosis cohort and 88.4% for the surveillance cohort, indicating 
false negatives in nearly 1 in 10 negative results. Further research in high-quality studies is needed to validate the 
performance of this assay, after which appropriate use of the assay and clinical usefulness will also need to be 
established. (This study is included in the systematic review and meta-analysis by Campo et al., 2024.).

In a 2022 cross-sectional study, Rettig et al. analyzed plasma from 110 individuals with initial or recurrent HPV positive 
OPSCC (without distant metastases) using a digital droplet polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based assay (NavDx
®
, 
Naveris Inc., Waltham, MA). This assay assesses tumor tissue–derived HPV DNA in plasma. The objective was to 
describe the clinical, pathologic, and imaging features associated with TTMV-HPV DNA. Circulating TTMV-HPV DNA was 
found in 98 individuals and was most strongly associated with clinical N stage. Few individuals (n = 11) had N0 stage 
disease and only four of these (36%) had detectable DNA. In subjects with clinical stage N1-N3 disease, 94/99 (95%) had 
detectable DNA. Of subjects with undetectable TTMV-HPV DNA, over half (seven of twelve) had clinical stage N0 
disease. The majority of individuals had computerized tomography (CT) and positron emission tomography (PET) scans 
available; TTMV-HPV DNA prevalence and score increased with progressively higher clinical nodal stage, diameter of 
largest lymph node, and higher nodal maximum standardized uptake value on PET/CT. In addition, the size of the largest 
cervical lymph node was more closely associated with the circulating TTMV-HPV DNA than it was with the size of the 
primary tumor. The authors concluded that circulating TTMV-HPV DNA detection and score were strongly associated with 
nodal disease in individuals with HPV-positive OPSCC, and the cause of this association as well as the use of this assay 
for surveillance merit further investigation. This study is limited by a relatively small number of participants, especially in 
certain subgroups, and potential author biases.  
 
Tumor-Informed and Tumor-Naive MRD Assays (e.g., Signatera) 
Signatera is an individualized molecular test that detects circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood of individuals who 
have been diagnosed with cancer. The test assesses molecular residual disease (MRD) following definitive treatment to 
monitor response and/or detect recurrence after remission. Signatera uses a whole exome sequencing-based, tumor-
informed approach to target specific mutations present in tumor tissue (Natera Inc., 2024). Currently, evidence to support 
clinical utility of Signatera use for monitoring response to treatment or for surveillance after treatment is lacking. 
 
A retrospective analysis of the effect of ctDNA monitoring on the identification and subsequent management of recurrence 
in 108 individuals with resected early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) was performed by Martin et al. in 2024. 
Signatera was used to detect and measure ctDNA at three-month intervals after cancer resection with curative intent had 
been performed. The study took place between October 2021 and March 2023 and at least one ctDNA measurement 
post-operatively and one CT scan report post-operatively were required for inclusion in the analysis. ctDNA-positive test 
results were the primary outcome measured. A secondary outcome assessed was change in treatment plan after ctDNA-
positive result. A total of 11.1% (n = 12) of the study participants were found to have ctDNA-positive results at one or more 
measurement intervals after surgery. Of these, eight participants (66.7%) had a clinically identifiable recurrence. The 
remaining four participants had limited clinical follow-up assessments. Overall, ten of the study participants developed 
recurrent disease and eight of these participants had ctDNA positivity. Brain-only metastases were found in the remaining 
two participants with recurrence. Of the 12 participants with ctDNA-positivity, 100% had a change in post-operative clinical 
care; all twelve participants with ctDNA-positive results underwent an early positron emission tomography scan with 
66.6% found to be positive for characteristics of malignancy. The authors concluded that routine monitoring of ctDNA after 
curative intent therapy may improve risk stratification and prognostic ability in this population. However, the small number 
of participants in this study coupled with its retrospective design limit its quality. In addition, some participants were not 
compliant with the regularly scheduled testing intervals and the providers involved in care of the participants were not 
blinded to ctDNA results when making decisions regarding their surveillance and adjuvant treatments. Lastly, several of 
the authors were employees of the company that manufactures the assay used in this study. Further high-quality, 
prospective studies with larger cohorts and longer follow up times are needed to validate these early results and help 
develop best-practice strategies. 
 
Another retrospective analysis focused on the use of Signatera to detect MRD in ctDNA was performed by Emiloju et al. in 
2024, this time in individuals with stage II-IV colorectal cancer (CRC). The researchers examined the clinical records of 
120 individuals with CRC who had undergone at least one tumor-informed ctDNA assay. A total of 476 ctDNA assays 
were performed on the 120 subjects. Seventy percent of the assays were administered for individuals who had recurrent 
disease, most often to monitor effectiveness of treatments provided. Only 16% of the total assays performed led to a 
change in clinical decision-making. Overall, 62 individuals experienced a total of 110 recurrences (some subjects had 
more than one recurrence). The authors determined that the results of this study show that although ctDNA for MRD 
detection may be helpful for certain individuals with CRC, 84% of the total assays included in this analysis resulted in no 
change to clinical decision-making, which highlights the need for additional study in high-quality clinical trials. 
 
In a Molecular Test Assessment (Hayes, Signatera [Natera Inc.], 2023, updated 2024) Signatera was evaluated for use in 
both monitoring response during treatment and monitoring for recurrence after treatment in individuals with solid tumor 
cancers. Hayes identified nine studies which assessed the clinical validity of Signatera, but no peer-reviewed articles that 
reported impact on clinical decision-making or an improvement in outcomes related to the use of Signatera, Significant 
questions exist regarding appropriate selection of individuals for testing and most effective timing of testing. In addition, 
the studies identified by Hayes had a wide variation in cancer types and treatments and overall quality was poor. At this

time, evidence is insufficient to support the use of Signatera for both monitoring response and detecting recurrence. 
Hayes notes, however, that there are multiple ongoing clinical trials evaluating these outcomes. The 2024 annual review 
of this Hayes assessment indicates that recently published evidence is unlikely to change the current Hayes rating for this 
test. 
 
In a retrospective, single-center cohort study, Fakih et al. (2022, included in the 2023 Hayes Signatera Molecular Test 
Assessment) evaluated the comparative surveillance strategies of ctDNA assay (Signatera) with standard radiographic 
imaging and carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) levels per NCCN guidelines in individuals with resected CRC. Out of 48 
individuals with curatively resected CRC, 15 had disease recurrence during surveillance. Confirmation via imaging was 
made on nine individuals, and positive ctDNA confirmed disease recurrent in 8, CEA levels in 3 individuals and combined 
imaging with CEA levels in 11 individuals. According to the numbers, ctDNA did not perform better than imaging in 
detecting recurrence, as sensitivity results were 53.3% (95% CI, 27.4%-77.7%) and 60% (95% CI, 32.9%-82.5%), 
respectively (p > .99). The combination of imaging plus measurement of CEA levels (sensitivity, 73.3% [95% CI, 44.8%-
91.1%]) had a numerical advantage compared with ctDNA in identifying recurrence (p = .55). In addition, authors noted no 
significant difference among ctDNA (median, 14.3 months), imaging (median, 15.0 months), or imaging plus measurement 
of CEA levels (median, 15.0 months) in the time to identify disease recurrence. The study is limited by its small size, a 
small number of reoccurrences, and short follow-up. The authors concluded that the findings show that ctDNA assay 
(Signatera) may not supply definitive advantages as a surveillance strategy compared to standard imaging combined 
measurement of CEA levels when performed per NCCN guidelines. Additional prospective studies focusing on the 
correlation between low-burden lung recurrence and negative ctDNA findings should be investigated further. 
 
The use of ctDNA as a prognostic biomarker for relapse of metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) was the subject of a 
cohort study by Loupakis et al. (2021, included in the 2023 Hayes Signatera Molecular Test Assessment). In this study, 
112 individuals with mCRC were evaluated. These participants were part of the PREDATOR clinical trial and had 
undergone resection of metastases with curative intent. In this study, evaluation of the prognostic value of ctDNA was 
performed by correlating clinical outcomes with molecular residual disease (MRD) status after surgery using a tumor-
informed, personalized ctDNA assay (Signatera). MRD positive results were found in 54.4% of the participants after 
surgery. Of those, 96.7% progressed at the time data collection ended. Positive results were also associated with lower 
overall survival. At the time of data analysis, 96% of all study participants in the MRD-negative arm of the study were 
living, compared with only 52.4% in the MRD-positive arm. For individuals who were MRD-negative in the combined 
ctDNA analysis at both points in time and did not receive systemic therapy, overall survival rate was 100%. When 
multivariate analysis was performed, the most significant prognostic factor associated with disease -free survival was 
ctDNA based MRD status. The researchers concluded that post-operative MRD evaluation is a strong biomarker in 
individuals with mCRC undergoing metastatic resection and feel that it has potential use in clinical decision-making. 
Further clinical studies will be needed to support use of this technology in the future. 
 
Magbanua et al. (2021, included in the 2023 Hayes Signatera Molecular Test Assessment) evaluated the clinical utility of 
ctDNA to test for risk of metastatic recurrence and predictive ability of pathologic complete response (pCR) for individuals 
with early BC. A retrospective ancillary ctDNA study was performed on samples that had been prospectively collected 
from high-risk individuals with early BC that were part of the multicenter neoadjuvant I-SPY2 TRIAL. Eligibility 
requirements included tumor size ≥ 2.5-cm and stage II/III BC. Participants with de novo metastatic disease were not 
included in the study. In addition, eligibility was limited to individuals who had received a MammaPrint high score. On 
pretreatment testing, 73% of participants were ctDNA positive. Those participants who continued to be ctDNA positive 3 
weeks after initiation of paclitaxel were significantly more likely to have residual disease after neoadjuvant chemotherapy 
(NAC) when compared to those who were no longer ctDNA positive. All individuals who achieved pCR after NAT were 
ctDNA negative. For participants who did not achieve pCR, ctDNA positive results had a significantly increased risk of 
metastatic recurrence. Notably, participants who were ctDNA negative but who did not achieve pCR still had excellent 
outcomes. In this study, lack of ctDNA clearance significantly predicted poor response and metastatic recurrence of 
cancer. Clearance of ctDNA was associated with improved survival. The researchers concluded that personalized testing 
of ctDNA during NAC may assist with clinical assessment and treatment in early BC. Noted limitations include the inability 
of the Signatera test to detect new second primary cancers and novel somatic variants that may have arisen during tumor 
evolution. Further studies are required, including those that simultaneously evaluate ctDNA and circulating tumor cells in 
the neoadjuvant setting. 
 
Reinert et al. (2019, included in the 2023 Hayes Signatera Molecular Test Assessment) reported results of a prospective, 
multi-center cohort study designed to analyze how ctDNA is associated with CRC recurrence. Ultradeep sequencing of 
plasma cell-free DNA was performed in study participants with CRC before pre- and post-surgery, during and after 
adjuvant chemotherapy (ACT), and during the surveillance period. The study took place in Demark and evaluated 125 
individuals with stages I to III CRC. Plasma samples were obtained prior to surgery, after surgery (day 30) and ongoing 
every third month for up to 3 years. In the pre-surgery period, ctDNA was detected in 88.5% of participants. Post definitive

treatment, ctDNA analysis identified 87.5% of relapses and at post-op day 30, ctDNA-positive participants were 7 times 
more likely to suffer relapse that those with negative ctDNA results. After ACT, ctDNA participants with positive results 
were 17 times more likely to relapse. During and after undergoing ACT, monitoring of participants found that 30% of the 
ctDNA positive individuals were cleared of disease. In the post-therapy period, ctDNA-positive participants were more 
than 40 times more likely to have a recurrence of their disease than the ctDNA-negative participants. Actionable mutations 
were found in 81.8% of the relapse samples that were ctDNA-positive. The researchers concluded that ctDNA analysis 
has potential to be helpful with postoperative management of CRC, in terms of early relapse detection, ACT monitoring 
and risk stratification. However, the sample size of participants with recurrent CRC in this study was small and analysis 
was done on multiple different subsets. This study provides a base for further clinical trials investigation the use of ctDNA 
in management of CRC and other diseases. 
 
Solid Tumor Profiling Including Whole Exome, Whole Genome, and/or Whole 
Transcriptome Sequencing 
Molecular assays using whole exome, whole genome, and/or whole-transcriptome sequencing to detect clinically 
meaningful somatic variations in tumor tissue have been developed. There is currently insufficient evidence in the peer-
reviewed clinical literature to support the use of these tests to provide molecular information intended to inform clinical 
decision-making for individuals with cancer. 
 
To explore the use of RNA next-generation sequencing (NGS) for the detection of fusions and splicing variations in 
individuals with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), Owen et al. (2024) performed a multisite, retrospective cohort study 
using the Tempus xR assay (tissue-based whole transcriptome RNA sequencing) and the Tempus xT assay, version 4 
(tissue-based DNA sequencing). The primary outcome assessed was detection rates of NCCN guideline-based structural 
variants that were uniquely identified by RNA-NGS. Included participants (n = 5570) had sufficient tissue quantity for both 
RNA-NGS and DNA-NGS testing. Overall, the frequency of actionable structural variant detection was 8.8% (n = 491) with 
86.7% of those variants detected via DNA-NGS. Performing concurrent DNA-NGS and RNA-NGS led to the detection of 
15.3% more participants with actionable structural variants (aSV) compared to use of only DNA-NGS (491 vs 426 
participants, respectively). No significant association was found between the assay that was used for aSV identification 
and aSV-targeted therapeutic adoption or clinical outcome. These results suggest that the identification of aSV through 
the use of concurrent RNA-NGS and DNA-NGS is higher across NCCN guideline-recommended biomarkers than the use 
of DNA-NGS alone, leading the authors to conclude that RNA-NGS should be considered for routine use in the clinical 
care of individuals with advanced NSCLC. The study was limited by the use of just one commercial NGS platform, and 
since the study was retrospective, there was incomplete longitudinal data regarding therapy selection and time-to-next-
treatment analyses which led to small cohort sizes and thus, potential difficulty detecting statistical differences between 
DNA-NGS and RNA-NGS. In addition, differences in assay failure rates between DNA-NGS and RNA-NGS were not 
accounted for in this study. Further high-quality, prospective studies are recommended to validate these findings and 
further investigate the use of RNA-NGS use as a companion diagnostic test.  
 
Pleasance et al. (2022) performed whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing and analysis (WGTA) on samples from 
570 individuals with various types of advanced or metastatic cancer to identify and prioritize clinically actionable genomic 
variations and potentially inform treatment decisions. Participants were enrollees in the Personalized OncoGenomics 
(POG) program (NCT02155621), a single-arm prospective trial with primary objectives of: 1) determining the feasibility of 
integrating WGTA in advanced cancer populations, 2) understanding the frequency of clinically actionable findings using 
WGTA and the potential rate of WGTA-informed therapy, and 3) obtaining better understanding of the genomics involved 
in advanced and pre-treated cancers. In the Pleasance study, DNA-based information was combined with RNA-based 
information to produce comprehensive WGTA profiles which were then reviewed by a multidisciplinary team. A total of 
83% of participants had clinically actionable targets, and of those, 37% went on to receive WGTA-informed treatment. The 
researchers found RNA expression data to be the most informative, with contributions to 67% of WGTA-informed 
treatments. Twenty-five percent of treatments were guided by RNA expression only. Forty-six percent of WGTA-informed 
treatments resulted in a clinical benefit. Based on these results, the authors contend that their study exhibits the potential 
benefit of using whole genome and transcriptome sequencing in the individualized care of persons affected with cancer. A 
noted barrier in the study was limited access to drugs that were related to WGTA results obtained; this underscores the 
need for access to approved off-label treatments and clinical trials to enhance potential for clinical action. An additional 
limitation was the lack of evaluation of impact of WGTA on overall survival. 
 
A 2022 prospective precision medicine trial (Summers et al.) used whole exome sequencing (WES) of tumor and germline 
tissue and whole transcriptome RNA sequencing of tumor tissue to assess genomic variations in 127 tumors from 126 
unique pediatric participants. The researchers identified somatic tumor variations in 95.3% of the participants. Cancer 
predisposition syndromes based on known pathogenic or likely pathogenic germline mutations were detected in 7.1% of 
the participants. In addition, they created a scoring system for measuring the impact of tumor and germline testing; at 
least one impactful finding from genomic testing was found in 85% of samples sequenced (108/127z). In 65.1% (82/126)

of participants, recommendation for consideration of a targeted agent was made and 20 participants went on to receive 
targeted therapy based on their results (24% of those receiving a recommendation and 16% of the total cohort). The 
authors concluded that paired tumor/normal WES and tumor whole transcriptome sequencing of de novo or 
relapsed/refractory tumors was possible and could have a significant clinical impact in individuals with high-risk pediatric 
cancers. Limitations included small sample size and lack of long-term outcome data. 
 
Clinical Practice Guidelines 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) 
ASCO’s 2022 publication (Henry et al.) updating to their Biomarkers for Systemic Therapy in Metastatic Breast Cancer 
guideline (Henry et al., 2022) indicates that there are “insufficient data to recommend routine use of ctDNA or circulating 
tumor cells to monitor response to therapy among patients with metastatic breast cancer” (Type: informal consensus; 
Evidence quality: low; Strength of recommendation: moderate). 
 
In a 2022 ASCO provisional opinion addressing somatic testing for individuals with metastatic or advanced cancer, 
Chakravarty et al. note that there is substantial interest in the detection of MRD for individuals whose recurrent cancer is 
not yet detectable by imaging. Studies evaluating several types of tumors have shown potential for the use of ctDNA to 
identify individuals who may be at higher risk for recurrence. However, no specific recommendations regarding the use of 
ctDNA for detection of MRD are made in this document. 
 
American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO)/College of American Pathologists (CAP) 
Merker et al. (2018) published a joint review from ASCO and CAP assessing the clinical use of ctDNA. The researchers 
performed a literature review and identified 1339 references. Of these references, 390 plus an additional 31 supplied by 
the researchers were evaluated. The literature review ultimately included 77 references and stated that while some ctDNA 
tests have demonstrated clinical validity and utility with specific advanced stage cancer, overall, there is insufficient 
evidence of clinical validity and utility for the majority of these assays in this stage of cancer. The researchers also noted 
that there is no evidence of clinical utility and little evidence of clinical validity of ctDNA tests in early-stage cancer, 
treatment monitoring, or residual disease detection. Likewise, no evidence of clinical validity and utility was demonstrated 
in the literature review for the use of ctDNA in cancer screening. 
 
European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) 
A 2022 ESMO publication (Pascual et al.) made recommendations specific to the use of ctDNA for individuals with cancer. 
Regarding the detection of MRD, the authors indicates that for individuals treated for early-stage cancers, there is strong 
evidence of validity for the prediction of future relapse for several cancer types, however MRD detection cannot be 
recommended for routine clinical practice as there is insufficient evidence for clinical utility in terms of directing treatment. 
The authors go on to state that for advanced cancer monitoring, there is “insufficient evidence to use regular monitoring of 
ctDNA during therapy. Although early ctDNA dynamics associate strongly with outcome, and resistance mutations may be 
identified many months before clinical progression, there is insufficient evidence that acting on such findings improves 
outcome". Lastly, with respect to the use of ctCNA for other purposes such as multi-cancer screening, ESMO states that 
“at this point, screening cannot be considered as a validated use for ctDNA assays.”  
 
National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) 
In 2022, NICE published a Medtech innovation briefing on Signatera for detecting MRD from solid tumor cancers. In 
summary, the briefing outlines the lack of prospective evidence on the utilization of Signatera in clinical practice or its 
effect on treatment decisions or clinical outcomes. Additionally, experts advised there is insufficient evidence to support 
the use of the technology routinely in the NHS. The experts point out their advice is in line with the recommendations from 
the ESMO on the use of ctDNA. Many ongoing trials may address the gaps in the evidence in the future. 
 
National Comprehensive Cancer Network (NCCN) 
Head and Neck Cancers 
In Head and Neck Cancers (version 2.2025), NCCN states “the performance of various plasma cell-free HPV DNA 
detection assays (preferably validated per CLIA and CAP regulatory guidelines) for a diagnosis of HPV-positive 
oropharyngeal cancer against a gold standard of E6/E7 mRNA detection is unknown. Sensitivity and specificity against 
p16-IHC are approximately 90% and 94%, respectively. At this time, persistent cell-free oncogenic HPV DNA detection in 
plasma (among those positive and quantifiable at diagnosis) may identify patients at increased risk for progression after 
completion of curative intent therapy. However, without concurrent clinical, radiographic, or pathological correlates 
represents an outcome without actionable therapeutic implications outside of clinical trials.”

Breast Cancer 
NCCN addresses the clinical use of circulating tumor cells (CTC) or ctDNA for monitoring of metastatic disease in its 
Breast Cancer (version 6.2024) guidelines, stating, “the clinical use of Circulating Tumor Cells (CTC) or circulating DNA 
(ctDNA) in metastatic breast cancer is not yet included in the NCCN Guidelines for Breast Cancer for disease assessment 
and monitoring"). This guideline does not discuss or make recommendations regarding testing for MRD. 
 
Colon Cancer 
Per NCCN (Colon Cancer, version 5.2024), post-surgical ctDNA assessment has been studied as a potential predictor for 
increased risk of recurrence in stage I-III colon cancer, however the value of this information has not been fully 
determined. Evidence substantiating predictive capabilities related to the benefit of chemotherapy is insufficient. NCCN’s 
colon cancer expert panel finds a lack of data to recommend the use of multigene assays, Immunoscore, or use of post-
surgical ctDNA to estimate risk of recurrence or to assist with decision-making regarding adjuvant therapy. The panel 
highlights the importance of ongoing clinical trials to further expand knowledge and provide data on these tests. 
 
Genetic/Familial High-Risk Assessment: Breast, Ovarian, Pancreatic, and Prostate 
In its 2.2025 guidelines, NCCN briefly mentions pre-symptomatic ctDNA cancer detection assays, stating that these 
assays “should only be offered in the setting of prospective clinical trials, because the sensitivity, false-positive rates, and 
positive predictive value of ctDNA tests for early-stage disease, which are needed to derive clinical utility and determine 
clinical validity, are not fully defined. The psychological impact of ctDNA testing remains unknown. For these reasons, 
ctDNA should not be used, outside of the clinical trial setting, to replace well-established methods of cancer screening 
(e.g., mammography). 
 
Rectal Cancer 
For adjuvant treatment or surveillance following operative management of rectal cancer, NCCN (Rectal Cancer, version 
4.2024) states, "Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is emerging as a prognostic marker; however, there is currently 
insufficient evidence to recommend routine use of ctDNA assays outside of a clinical trial.” The guideline also indicates 
that ctDNA has no proven role in the nonoperative management of rectal cancer. 
 
Melanoma: Cutaneous 
In NCCN’s Cutaneous Melanoma guidelines (version 3.2024), it is noted that existing and emerging molecular techniques 
such as ctDNA tests should be prospectively compared to determine clinical utility. No recommendations regarding ctDNA 
are made in this guideline.
