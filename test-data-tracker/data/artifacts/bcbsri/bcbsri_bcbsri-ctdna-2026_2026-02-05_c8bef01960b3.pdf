POLICY LAST REVIEWED: 01|07|2026 
OVERVIEW 
Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) and circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in peripheral blood, referred to as 
“liquid biopsy,” have several potential uses for guiding therapeutic decisions in patients with cancer or being 
screened for cancer. 
This policy does not address the use of blood-based testing (liquid biopsy) to select targeted treatment for 
breast cancer, metastatic colorectal cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma/glioma, ovarian cancer, 
pancreatic cancer, and prostate cancer, the use of liquid biopsy to select immune checkpoint inhibitor 
therapy, tumor-Informed circulating tumor DNA testing for cancer management, comprehensive genomic 
profiling for selecting targeted cancer therapies, the use of blood-based testing for detection or risk 
assessment of prostate cancer; or the use of AR-V7 circulating tumor cells for metastatic prostate cancer.

BACKGROUND 
Liquid biopsy refers to analysis of circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) or circulating tumor cells (CTCs) as 
methods of noninvasively characterizing tumors and tumor genome from the peripheral blood. 
 
Circulating Tumor DNA 
Normal and tumor cells release small fragments of DNA into the blood, which is referred to as cell-free 
DNA. Cell-free DNA from nonmalignant cells is released by apoptosis. Most cell-free tumor DNA is derived 
from apoptotic and/or necrotic tumor cells, either from the primary tumor, metastases, or CTCs. Unlike 
apoptosis, necrosis is considered a pathologic process, and generates larger DNA fragments due to an 
incomplete and random digestion of genomic DNA. The length or integrity of the circulating DNA can 
potentially distinguish between apoptotic and necrotic origin. Circulating tumor DNA can be used for 
genomic characterization of the tumor. 
 
Circulating Tumor Cells 
Intact CTCs are released from a primary tumor and/or a metastatic site into the bloodstream. The half-life of 
a CTC in the bloodstream is short (1-2 hours), and CTCs are cleared through extravasation into secondary 
organs. Most assays detect CTCs through the use of surface epithelial markers such as EpCAM and 
cytokeratins. The primary reason for detecting CTCs is prognostic, through quantification of circulating 
levels. 
 
Detecting Circulating Tumor DNA and Circulating Tumor Cells 
Detection of ctDNA is challenging because ctDNA is diluted by nonmalignant circulating DNA and usually 
represents a small fraction (<1%) of total cell free DNA. Therefore, more sensitive methods than the 
standard sequencing approaches (e.g., Sanger sequencing) are needed. 
 
Highly sensitive and specific methods have been developed to detect ctDNA, for both single nucleotide 
mutations e.g. BEAMing [which combines emulsion polymerase chain reaction with magnetic beads and flow 
cytometry] and digital polymerase chain reaction and copy-number changes. Digital genomic technologies 
allow for enumeration of rare mutant variants in complex mixtures of DNA. 
 
Approaches to detecting ctDNA can be considered targeted, which includes the analysis of known genetic 
mutations from the primary tumor in a small set of frequently occurring driver mutations, which can impact 
therapy decisions, or untargeted without knowledge of specific mutations present in the primary tumor, and 
include array comparative genomic hybridization, next-generation sequencing, and whole exome and genome 
sequencing. 
 
CTC assays usually start with an enrichment step that increases the concentration of CTCs, either on the basis 
of biologic properties (expression of protein markers) or physical properties (size, density, electric charge). 
CTCs can then be detected using immunologic, molecular, or functional assays. 
 
 
For individuals who have advanced cancer who receive testing of CTCs to select targeted treatment, the 
evidence includes observational studies. The relevant outcomes are overall survival, progression-free survival, 
recurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication 
use. Given the breadth of methodologies available to assess CTCs, the clinical validity of each commercially

available test must be established independently, and these data are lacking. Published studies reporting 
clinical outcomes and/or clinical utility are lacking. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical 
utility preclude conclusions about whether the use of CTCs can replace variant analysis of tissue. The 
evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. 
 
For individuals who have cancer who receive testing of ctDNA to monitor treatment response, the evidence 
includes randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews with meta-analysis, and observational studies. Relevant 
outcomes are overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, disease-specific survival, test 
accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication use. Numerous randomized clinical trials and systematic 
reviews identified an association with the detection of ctDNA or the kinetics of ctDNA and worse clinical 
outcomes for individuals with cancer, thus illustrating the clinical validity of testing for ctDNA. However, 
studies reporting clinical utility are lacking. Further studies are needed to establish a standardized definition 
for ctDNA molecular response and to illustrate how ctDNA testing can lead to different treatment regimens 
for cancer management. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical utility preclude conclusions 
about whether the use of ctDNA should be used to monitor treatment response. The evidence is insufficient 
to determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. 
 
For individuals who have cancer who receive testing of CTCs to monitor treatment response, the evidence 
includes a randomized controlled trial, observational studies, and systematic reviews of observational studies. 
Relevant outcomes are overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence-free survival, disease-specific 
survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication use. Given the breadth of methodologies 
available to assess CTCs, the clinical validity of each commercially available test must be established 
independently, and these data are lacking. The available randomized controlled trial found no effect on 
overall survival when patients with persistently increased CTC levels after first-line chemotherapy were 
switched to an alternative cytotoxic therapy. Other studies reporting clinical outcomes and/or clinical utility 
are lacking. The uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical utility preclude conclusions about 
whether the use of CTCs should be used to monitor treatment response. The evidence is insufficient to 
determine the effects of the technology on health outcomes. 
 
For individuals who have received curative treatment for cancer who receive testing of ctDNA to predict risk 
of relapse, the evidence includes randomized clinical trials, systematic reviews with meta-analysis, and 
observational studies. Relevant outcomes are overall survival, progression-free survival, recurrence-free 
survival, disease-specific survival, test accuracy and validity, morbid events, and medication use. Numerous 
randomized clinical trials and systematic reviews identified an association with the detection of ctDNA or the 
kinetics of ctDNA and worse clinical outcomes for individuals with cancer, thus illustrating the clinical 
validity of testing for ctDNA. However, there were no studies assessing clinical utility. Further studies are 
needed to distinguish the timing to assess ctDNA to accurately prognosticate the clinical outcomes for 
individuals with cancer and establish thresholds that lead to meaningful predictions for clinical outcomes. The 
uncertainties concerning clinical validity and clinical utility preclude conclusions about whether the use of 
ctDNA should be used to predict relapse response. The evidence is insufficient to determine the effects of 
the technology on health outcomes.
